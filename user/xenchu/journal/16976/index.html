<div class="span8">
<p><p>One of <b>my</b> problems with learning Perl is -- I don't know enough Perl. A common but frustrating problem. Let me explain my learning situation.</p>
<p>
Here is an example from one of my Perl books (not Camel or Llama, by the way):</p>
<p>
<i>@numerics = map {/^\d + /?$_:()} <>;</i></p>
<p>
Now, since the book tells me what this construct is doing (it calculates lines starting with numbers, and then builds a list of the lines input), most of operation is clear enough. Map reads a line from input, checks to find out if the line starts with a digit and then does -- what? I see $_ which is the line input but what does the ? mean? Is it part of the regex or does it operate on $_? What is the purpose of :()? Is :() one operation or two? And why '+ ' instead of \b?</p>
<p>
I checked the index and found nothing I thought applied. I doubt that means the answer is not in the book, just that if I saw the answer I didn't recognize it. And if I have come across what I want to know in earlier reading I have either forgotten it or I wasn't paying sufficient attention. Either option has a 50% chance of being true.</p>
<p>
Nothing as concise as map is present in any other language I program in. The ease with which it can be used is fascinating. I know I will find out what I want to know eventually. I am sure all of you who read this see my problem <i>(he's an idiot)</i> and understand what I am trying to say. The more you have of a thing the easier it is to get more. It works for Perl as with everything else.</p>
<p>
The solution is obvious; keep studying Perl. Most things that frustrate me seem easy when I look back on them knowing the answer. This will probably not be an exception. And as they say, 'a good learning experience'. As I gain knowledge of Perl the pieces will start to come together.</p>
<p>
Hello to <b>chaoticset</b> who has signed on as a Fan. Astounding, just astounding. And hello to <b>merlyn</b> and <b>Louis_Wu</b> as well. I am certain that all three know exactly what the example above means. Inspires me to keep trying to catch up with them to know others have learned before me.</p>
<p>
And a public thanks to <b>Corion</b> who answered a Perl Monk question I asked in an earlier journal entry.</p>

<p>
Thank you. Another thing I am not used to yet is that Perl allows operations to be jammed together. I would have expected<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/^d + / ? $_ : (); In the languages I am familiar with that spacing makes a difference. It would be an <i>error</i> to write like that!</p>

<h2>Actually...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2004-01-23T17:17:51</h3>
What you have is an emulated <tt>grep</tt>. I wonder why the author didn't just use that. Your snippet is equivalent to<blockquote><div> <tt>@numerics = grep {<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/^\d + / } LIST;</tt> </div></blockquote>

<p>
Actually he did list the grep you give as another way it would work along with a 'while' example. The reason I listed the map example is I didn't understand how it worked. I was displaying my ignorance, not the author's.</p>

<h2>why +</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2004-01-23T18:32:50</h3>
Your main question has already been answered, but you also asked why the + was there and why it wasn't \b.<p>
The + is actually irrelevant - it could be removed.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/^\d+/ looks at the beginning of the matched text (^) for one digit (\d) or more digits (+). If the plus were changed to \b, it would require exactly one digit and disallow the line if that digit was immediately followed by an alphanumeric. If the + were removed, it would look for one digit at the start of a line (and if a line starts with one or more digits, it starts with one, so that still matches the exact same set of lines). The + would be useful in other instances, like for example, if it were just the leading numbers that were being captured instead of entire lines that start with a digit.</p><p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>/^(\d+)/ &amp;&amp; push @list, $1 for &lt;IN&gt;;</p><p>
(Note that along with learning perl, you also demonstrated a need to learn html as it applies to posting here. To post the text &lt;IN&gt; you cannot just write it literally, since the html will decide that your IN html directive should be ignored.  Instead you have to write the IO reader as &amp;lt;IN&amp;gt;.  The preview button and a lot of experimentation are your friends...)</p>

<p>
Another visual disfunction. Usually I see that written as d+ and not 'd +'. In the languages I usually program you have to be <i>exact</i>. Somehow I equated that with \b. No good reason why.</p>
<p>
I am a little puzzled by your comment on &lt;N&gt;. I don't recall using the term here. Was it in another journal entry? Other special characters appear in Preview as they are. But looking at it in Preview I see the angle characters vanish. Now I see. Thanks for the tip.</p>

Oops, I didn't see the space in your message. That means the pattern is requiring exactly one digit, followed by one or more spaces. (The + is still pointless in this case.) If you use the x modifier on a regular expression, the space would be for formatting purposes and not matching, so<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/^\d+/ and<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/^ \d +/x are the same, but when the x is not there, spaces and other whitespace characters match themselves.<p>
When it is &lt;SPACE&gt;+, it is still not the same as \b.  The \b pattern matches a "word boundary", i.e. a zero-length position which has a word character on one side and does not have a word character on the other. (With the text "The 3 goats." \b would match the position before the T, the position before and after each blank, and the position before the period.)  The difference between "\b" and " +" are twofold - first, \b matches strings that the other would not (e.g. the string "1=2" would be successfully matched by<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/^\d\b/ but not by<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/^\d +/) and second, if the pattern is being used for a substitution or if the matched text is referenced with $1, $&amp;, or suchlike, the trailing blanks would be part of the match with<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/^\d +/ but they would not with<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/^\d\b/;</p>

<h2>Ecode is your friend</h2>

Just wrap your code examples with &lt;ecode&gt;&lt;/ecode&gt; and all the escaping is taken care of<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

That threw me too, don't feel bad.  I had never seen it in C before I started Perling.

Thanks. I begin to think I am Perl visually-impaired. Another learning problem.</p>
