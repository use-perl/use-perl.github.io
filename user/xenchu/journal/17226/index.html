My wife's reaction to an event seems strange to me. Her boss just got fired. She told me that she has decided not to work at the place any more because of that.</p>
<p>
Now here is what I find strange. Last year both she and her boss worked at the same place for a different organization. Her boss was an assistant manager. Their boss at that time got my wife fired. He accused her of being slack, inefficient, etc. It was not true. To get her fired he had to have the backing of his assistant managers. They lied to back him up. They told her they lied to keep their jobs.</p>
<p>
When the business changed hands she went back to work there. They hired her immediately because they knew her and knew what kind of work she did. I don't really understand it. I would never have gone back to work for them and I surely wouldn't be quitting because someone who helped get me fired by lying got fired. As far as I am concerned, loyalty runs both ways and her boss showed her none at all. My wife is a sweet woman who likes everybody but her reasoning is beyond me.</p>  </p>

<p>It appears to my your wife is a much better person than most people I know.

</p><p>Congratulations</p>

Thank you. I certainly think she is better than most people. But my prejudice in the matter is obvious.</p>

<p>I really should read <i>me</i> posts/comments twice, before submiting.</p>

I agree with cog about your wife, xenchu.  Your wife might be a truly selfless person.  Loyalty may go both ways, but if your wife feels the person was treated unfairly, then this is enough reason to leave.<br> <p>Someone who stands up against unfairness, even in the face of past history where you might expect otherwise, is rare and wonderful.</p>

In the end, I conclude that the heart knows no logic.
<p>(Whereas the liver is COLD AND CALCULATING!)</p>



<h2>Insufficient data...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2004-02-08T11:38:07</h3>
Perhaps there's something missing from the picture. Like the reason they now fired her boss.

No, she knows why they fired her boss. My wife thought they gave the boss a set of goals to meet and then hindered the boss' ability to meet them. Not that she thought the boss was guiltless, but she thought it was wrong to do things the way the company did. I am not sure I totally agree with my wife but I wasn't there and it is not my call anyway. My wife plans to quit in about a month when we are finished moving.</p>
<p>
To reiterate what I said in the beginning I don't think I would have supported someone who did not support me, but I fully agree that my wife is a better person than I am.</p>
