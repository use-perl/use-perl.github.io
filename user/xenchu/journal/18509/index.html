<p><p>Perl class had to be held in an alternate classroom yesterday. This required checking out a laptop and projector for showing the PowerPoint slides. Usually my co-teacher handles that but he is off this week.</p>
<p>
So I check out the laptop and the projector and go down to the classroom an hour early to make sure I have time to set everything up. Ah, Optimism! What a high flight and what a hard fall.</p>
<p>
First I couldn't sign on to the laptop with any id/password I tried. Then I found out that, no stupid, it is <b>not</b> a wireless setup. So I connect it to the wall outlet. Still didn't work. Finally after some consultation I signed in as a workstation.</p>
<p>
That meant I had to return to my desk and download the presentation to a floppy and carry it back to the classroom. That took trying two different disks before I got a copy. Then I go back to the classroom and try it. It works. Rah!</p>
<p>
On to the projector which, of course, did not work as expected either. The font size on screen kept changing. I finally had to get help on that. Then, at last, all was ready.</p>
<p>
This was the smallest attendance at a class yet. Everyone, it seemed, was on vacation or in another class or "just couldn't make it". The teaching part went well enough, except that my voice kept trying to give out. I had been too busy to go and get a glass of water. You would have thought the class was being given by a rusty gate from the sound. At least now we have finished Regular Expressions.</p></p>
