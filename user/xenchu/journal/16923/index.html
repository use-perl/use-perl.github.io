I am a stone newbie here. I am not sure where to find anything or how to ask where to look for anything.</p>
<p>
Despite my newbieness I find that I have two 'Fans'. Wow! And what fans! They are <b>merlyn</b> and <b>Louis Wu</b>. If anyone in the Perl universe doesn't know who <b>merlyn</b> is...open your programming text, he probably wrote it. He is also a prominent inhabitant of Perl Monks and masterful answerer of questions there. As for <b>Louis Wu</b>, he is another prominent denizen of Perl Monks and a question answerer of note but he hasn't written any books yet (as <b>Louis Wu</b> anyway.)</p>
<p>
I am honored to have these distinguished gentlemen as Fans (whatever a Fan is). Perhaps knowing they are there will keep me from writing anything too stupid in this journal. I can only hope so.</p>

I use the Friend feature to read journals, as it provides a <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Louis_Wu/amigos/" title="perl.org">single page</a perl.org> where I can read lots of Perlish journals, and learn from the experiences of others.  As such, if anyone has an active journal, I mark them Friend, and look forward to reading about their computer experiences.
<p>
BTW, it's a bit odd to find myself in a comparison with merlyn, especially since I don't come out looking like an idiot.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I too use "Friends" in that manner.
And what I really wish is a feature that would simply give me all the journals <i>except</i> for those that I had explicitly unsubscribed from.  No method to do that. {sigh}
