I mean he must have one right? He is an author with a <i>hot</i> book, so it follows he makes lots of money, right? So I am helping him fuel his yatch.</p>
<p>
That is, I just bought a copy of <b><i>Learning Perl(3rd ed.)</i></b>. I am on chapter 6 now and enjoying the experience so far. What I am reading is helping to solidify things I picked up elsewhere and didn't quite understand.</p>
<p>
As little as I remember of the 2nd edition, this version seems clearer. Granted I have been studying since then and granted my memory is a bit hazy, this version seems better laid out and talks about things I need to know.</p>
<p>Anyway, if, like me, you are floundering in Perl waters, this ia good...uh, yatch.</p></p>

What's a yatch anyway? It's a well known fact that Merlyn has a yack. Some people go as far as to say that the yack is the cause of Merlyn's celibacy, but I don't think that's the reason.

Gah! That should be <b>yacht</b>. I have no knowledge of yaks, but obviously know dyslexia.</p>

It's actually a phonetic reference to the Monty Python sketch about a man named Raymond Luxury Yacht, whose name is mispronounced as 'yacht and then 'yatch', at which point he angrily corrects the interviewer as follows:
<blockquote><div>It's pronounced 'throat warbler mangrove'!</div></blockquote>

<h2>Author Rates</h2>

<blockquote><div> <em>He is an author with a hot book, so it follows he makes lots of money, right?</em> </div></blockquote>

<p>As a rough calculation, figure the author earns $25 or $30 per page.  (That's likely a little low, as far as median figures go, but it has a nice averagey feel otherwise.)  A good author can produce four finished, well-edited pages per day.  Figure in the time spent proofreading <em>after</em> delivering the final manuscript as well as the time between advance payments and royalty payments too.</p>

<p>It takes a supremely popular technical book to earn the author enough to buy a nice yacht.  I can only think of a handful of those.</p>



<h2>The sad case for technical writing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2004-02-17T14:53:38</h3>
Even having helped with <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/books/" title="stonehenge.com">ten wildly popular books</a stonehenge.com> (counting major editions), I'm pretty sure my total royalties divided into my total time spent puts me at around minimum wage for every book.  And I'm lucky: most people never even see money after their initial advance (which never exceeds $5K for O'Reilly books).
<p>
Also consider that the typical royalty contract puts 10% of the <i>wholesale</i> cost of the book into the collective author's hands, and a lot of books are co-written.  Yes, I make about a dollar, pre-tax, per copy of the Llama.  That's it.  Put another way, I make more money off <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/cgi/amazon?isbn=0596001320" title="stonehenge.com">my amazon referral of the llama</a stonehenge.com> than I make off the actual book sale as an author.
</p><p>
So, why write?  I write as a credential.  The books have earned me a foothold into corporate america for my training and consulting services.
</p><p>
That, and I get a lot of free beer from loyal fans, which I appreciate greatly.</p>
