<p>What's this??? It all started with our customer requirement:<p>



<cite>
Provide change management and quality assurance procedures to support a professional system maintenance with high quality and provide tools to facilitate promotion and rollback of software releases and configuration changes while maintaining operational availability.
</cite>

<p>The question was how? No way with CPAN shell. What about using packaging? Our operations saied "yes we are fine with packaging our own stuff but, ...":</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ubuntu LTS Server as a distribution</li>

	<li>no backports, all non distribution packages with "corp-" prefix</li>
	<li>all "our stuff" goes to /corp (I know <a href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">FHS</a>, this was not my decision)</li>
	<li>Perl without threads</li>
</ul>


<p>This requirements meant that all Perl libraries + Perl binary it self, mod_perl and finally decision was made for Apache too, had to be repackaged.</p>

<p>Packaging all fron scratch will be not a good idea as there is really a lot of work done by Debian maintainers. At first I've tried to use packages from next stable (but not LTS) Ubuntu release - Intrepid, I've changed that all dependencies were prefixed with "corp-" + make them install in /corp but then I gave up. Stable sounds nice but we will sooner or later need the recent versions from CPAN. I've realized that Debian testing - Sid is exacly what we need. Sid has quite recent versions and package maintainers keeps on upgrading. For someone a distribution with "testing" in a name can be a bit "unprofesional" but each Perl module has an extensive test suit that has to pass before package is created. Also at least one person is using that version - the maintainer, and it's very likely that it was used by several people in Debian unstable before it entered testing. Debian package-flow allows to enter packages from unstable to testing only when there is no release-critical bug on package it self and all it's dependecies can go to testing as well. So the Perl modules in Sid are well tested befor entering testing :-) and the result is that Sid should have the latest CPAN snapshot of modules that works together fine. My result is that we now have Ubuntu LTS with Perl from Debian Sid. If it will be good or not only time will tell...
</p>


<p>More about this idea + reasoning + how I did it + experience I gained with this project and how I would like to use it for open source world will be in my next blog entry, this one is already toooo long :-)</p>

... but fails horribly for me when simply trying to deploy an application.<br/><br/>To explain this I'll focus on my prefered distribution, debian.
Installing debian packages is simply, you get it from the standard repositories, or 3rdparty ones which laos relate to the current set of distributions (stable/testing/unstable). All dependencies *including* the C based APIs that might be required are resolved and simply installed (without asking a million questions, yes I know you can turn it off, but it's hard to find the cause of why it fails then... and it fails mostly due to some simple module failing a single test)<br/><br/>CPANs problem is mostly due to the tests running for the installation of every package, tests the probably have run already for hundreds or thousand others in a more or less similar environment (at least for those using one of the big standard linux distributions). No real need to rerun this tests on every installation. It's fine for a devel box, because I wont to know that the module I upgrade/install works here, but not when I release and deploy my application.<br/><br/>So it would problably make sense to have a BIPAN (a binary installation perl archive network) to simply install the modules, but then again, would this not just duplicate efforts what the actual distributions do. Yes it would, so it's wasted resources, as we probably would never be able to accomodate all the required 3rdparty packages into BIPAN.<br/><br/>So it would probably make more sense to have a simple way to generate packages for distributions. Something that extracts the CPAN info and generates the debian packaging dir or it, or the RPM specfile, hence allowing the package maintainers to easy their work. On debian there is already the great cpan2deb (dh-make-perl) which does that from the other side. Maybe some Module::Install could help here, at least for the most common distruibutions (another topic to discuss endlessly)<br/><br/>Puh, lengthy comment, sorry bout' that, but thanks for reading through.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I'm quite used to the debian distribution, so packaging<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.deb archives

<p>The CP5.6.2AN is a brilliant idea that <em>could</em> provide a lot of feedback to CPAN uploaders as well as CPAN users.  I could imagine a useful subscription service that bundled together dependencies which tested successfully on a given platform.</p>

What I really like about Debian testing is that it's already here.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) It has plenty of maintainers that are already watching over about the modules. There is already bug-tracing tool for the packaged versions. Also another nice thing about packaging is that it is easy to include patches to the original source. For example Perl 5.10.0 it self has 22 packaging releases and includes 58 fixes patches (you can see which <a href="http://patch-tracking.debian.net/package/perl/5.10.0-22" title="debian.net">http://patch-tracking.debian.net/package/perl/5.10.0-22</a debian.net> search for "fixes/"). For a private repository everyone is fee to add patches to the Perl modules he needs when he needs and not wait for module author to accept it + release it.

<p>Thing is, with good-quality test suites (which Debian mostly lacks), you can automate much of the release engineering process. That&#8217;s part of a possible extrapolation from David&#8217;s post: a system whereby a new release automatically becomes part of the <code>testing</code> package set if it passes not only its own test suite against when running against the rest of <code>testing</code>, but with it installed, all of its (immediate and indirect) dependents within <code>testing</code> also pass theirs. That way you could get a &#8220;rolling&#8221; <code>testing</code> repository that tracks the bleeding edge relatively closely yet stays fairly stable &#8211; as long as the test suites are sufficiently good. (For modules with many reverse dependencies, they tend to be.)</p>

The tests are important, everyone knows. One think that I want to try is to package Perl modules and keep the tests. Let's say in "/usr/share/t/package-name". Then it will be possible to run tests again when ever there will be a need. And this "need" should come up every time there is a new versions of a module as every other module that depends on the new one should be retested. At the end of the chain it includes our own "product" tests. This can not be done with CPAN shell, can it? Imagine that you start to have a problem with some production server, it will be possible to go to<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/share/t/ run `prove -r<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.` and every piece of sw on that machine will be retested. That could cast some light.

<h2>&quot;Perl without threads&quot; ?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grantm/">grantm</a> on 2009-06-01T22:15:54</h3>
I'm interested in your reasoning for running "Perl without threads".  I've done a lot of work with developing and deploying Perl and mod_perl apps on Debian and have yet to find a reason to build my own perl executable.  Does building a Perl without threading support have some advantage over the core build?



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:&quot;Perl without threads&quot; ?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jozef/">jozef</a> on 2009-06-02T08:06:06</h3>
Actually it was a "company decision". The Perl without threads is used here for a long time. The main reason is, that in some cases Perl without threads is 10-30% faster and as we never use threads here, it's fine to disable them. Actually I would like to know who and how uses Perl threads as one can never be sure if some CPAN code is (or stays) thread safe. And probably using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?POE" title="cpan.org">POE</a cpan.org>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?AnyEvent" title="cpan.org">AnyEvent</a cpan.org> or other event loop system is much better than threads.

<p>Perl threads aren&#8217;t really threads, they&#8217;re a hobbled emulation of <code>fork()</code> that still doesn&#8217;t work right in many cases (taint mode, anyone?). There are only two reasons to use Perl threads: <i>1)</i> Windows <i>2)</i> mod_perl. Both are bad ideas as far as I&#8217;m concerned. I prefer to compile Perl without threads and use <code>fork()</code> when I need <code>fork()</code>.</p>
