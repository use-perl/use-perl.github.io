I started to write a review about "The Myths of Innovation" and it turned out to be quite long one. Here is the place where I mentioned Perl in it:
</p>

<b>Chapter 5, The lone inventor</b>

<p>
<cite>History loves the notion of the sole innovator. History is wrong.
Successful companies are started, and made successful by at least two, and
usually more, soulmates. -Guy Kawasaki
</cite>
</p>

<p>Slovak saying says - <cite>One swallow will not make spring.</cite>
One clever person in the team is not enough. And more he is "out" the less
is he accepted. Or there is no opponent. That is not healthy for the team
neither for the company. To find someone that is on the same wavelength
is really hard. But when it happens we get resonance.
</p>

<p>One theory says, that everything was here already. Even if the inventor
is alone with his, still unfamous, idea, he never starts from scratch.
There are always thoughts and ideas from others that tried similar things.
</p>

<p>This is the attribute that I value the most about the
<a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> programming language. Specifically
on the page of <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">Comprehensive Perl Archive Network</a>
we can find more then 14 thousand universal solutions from more than
6 thousand authors from nearly any field - informatics, mathematics,
chemistry, physics, ... There is no need to reinvent the wheel. Or if someone
has a different opinion on the problem definition/solution he is free to
first learn from the others and then create a different (better?) one.
It's like having 6 thousand colleagues!
</p>
