So time passed since <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/">YAPC::EU::2009</a>
This was my third YAPC visit and the first one where I
had a talk. Was nice, was fun, were a lot of people. :) If anyone haven't
been to any YAPC then, yes, it's worth it! It's kind of strange to find out
that the CPAN authors are made of flash and bones and it's possible to see
them, well and touch them, just not too much please! :D
</p>

<p>
So what was there to see? My first <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/talk/1961">talk</a>
that I attender was about <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?AI::CBR">AI::CBR</a> from
Darko. His module can be used to add some more intelligence to for example
search results. I like it as it was a really practical one. As this YAPC::EU
topic was "Corporate Perl" there was a lot of talk about how is Perl used
in corporates and what problems does the Perl developers face. From the new
thinks, there were talks about <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/talk/1802">MooseX:Declare</a>
(by pdcawley&#8206;), <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/talk/2097">KiokuDB</a>
(by nothingmuch&#8206;), <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/talk/2088">Regexp::Gramars</a> (by Damian),
<a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/talk/1873">Perl 5.10.1</a> (by rgs), ...
What else did I learn? That it's possible to do
<a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/talk/2029">speach recognition</a>
(by Thomas Netousek), how to <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/talk/1775">write reusable code</a>
- 1st rule: don't write it but reuse (from domm), how to
<a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/talk/2070">Test::Regexp</a> (by Abigail),
how to <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/talk/2066">remotely control volunteers</a>
(by Karen) and that it's not so bad to give a talk at YAPC...
</p>

<p>
Regarding my talk I was afraid of three things - the camera, Damian and
the audience. The cameras were missing, Damian didn't show up, not too many
people show up and well the audience was great!
</p>

<p>
As I said, I was a worried about the recording of my talk, that if the talk
will be not good it will be there on the net for ever. Well and internet never
forgets... On the other hand, after I found out there there were no recordings,
I was sad that I will be not able to watch my talk later on to compare and see
how it was.
</p>

<p>
Damian is not biting ..., but it was a surprise to see that he marked my
talk in his personal schedule.
</p>

<p>
There were ~20 people that attended my talk. At the same time there was a
<a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/talk/2062">talk</a> from Paul Fenwick
professional trainer and speaker with ~120 attendees...
Thanks to "mime" audience, I've enjoyed my talk. I got some interesting
questions and direct feedback after the talk. Special thanks to
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/andy/">andy.sh</a> for his dependencies
question and suggestion to generate Makefile. I'm keeping this in the back
of my mind and I think I'll really use this idea.
</p>

<p>
What was the talk about? It was about how to do static generated content and
what can be done with it. Once I have read the <a href="http://www.samba.org/">Samba</a>
documentation for developers and there was written about code generation, that major part of the C code
is generated. There was written, that once they started to do code generation they just
could not stop. I have felt to the same trap with web content generation. I've
tried it and I can not stop until I find out where are the limits. :) The
idea is not new, it's here since beginning of the web. <a href="http://movabletype.org/">MT</a>
does it, <a href="http://www.webgui.org/">WebGUI</a> does it, my friend
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/potyl/">Emmanuel</a> does it :) but still
I think it's interesting to speak about it.
</p>

<p>
During my 40minutes talk I kind of run out of time. I've tried to show too
many thinks in too much details. My 40 YAPC::EU minutes are gone, but
there is enough time and place on this blog. So I've decided to create a
blog series and here are the future titles:
</p>

<p>
1. make mehappy &nbsp; # make for fun and profit<br/>
2. a hook for you<br/>
3. scraping my self<br/>
4. less can be more<br/>
5. dÃÂ´veruj ale preveruj<br/>
6. feed us back<br/>
7. XSLT hammer<br/>
8. one Apache child must be enough for everyone<br/>
9. 12MB XML -> 2x5k HTML pages &nbsp; # the way of elephant<br/>
</p>
