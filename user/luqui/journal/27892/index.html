<p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Allison:
	- Punie now compiles and executes statements
	- print a single digit, multiple digits, or a string with word characters
	- no space characters<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- that's certainly a start<br/><br/>Allison:
	- I want to use Patrick's Text::Balanced hack
	- oh, it also parses multiple statements<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- that's a good way of keeping your code concise
	- is Roberta still gone?<br/><br/>Allison:
	- she'll be back December 14th<br/><br/>Luke:
	- I'm doing finals
	- they're final projects
	- thinking about the type system stuff in my free time
	- also talked to Autrijus about it
	- he convinced me that leaving out a type system is a bad idea for
	  interoperability
	- he said some extremely large undecidable calculus
	- trying to come up with a good type system as dynamic at Perl 5's at
	  runtime, but at compile time<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- doesn't sound like much<br/><br/>Luke:
	- fairly well-researched except not at all<br/><br/>Larry:
	- only worth two or three PhDs<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- when do you start to free up again?<br/><br/>Luke:
	- my last final is on Monday
	- I'll probably start madly hacking, as long as I have something to
	  procrastinate<br/><br/>Larry:
	- merrily hacking away on the Perl 5 to Perl 5 translator
	- translates 73% of the test suite successfully
	- successfully collecting all the type information that the compiler loses
	- starting to think about how I'll use that information
	- also for translating to Perl 6
	- that's still in thought status
	- I'm past the hump on the thing
	- I guess there are two though
	- getting the first 5% of the tests to pass was really hard
	- probably the last 5% will be really hard too
	- then I can think about downloading and translating all of CPAN back to
	  itself
	- the tricky thing is I'm not sure what to do about BEGIN blocks that
	  skip tests
	- don't bother compiling the rest
	- maybe I need a shim that says "this BEGIN block said to exit, but don't"
	- usually a runtime reason, not a compile-time reason
	- I'm only interested to running until CHECK time basically
	- also worth two or three PhDs<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- then do you plan to spit out an arbitrary AST or go straight to Perl 6?<br/><br/>Larry:
	- I want to be able to spit out the AST, just for Perl 5
	- somewhere in there
	- when I have that done
	- we can open it up
	- pulling the information out of Perl 5 is the insane part of it
	- having the AST out in some form cleanly is a point at which we can open
	  up the project to multiple contributors<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- I can see some of the crazy Pugs kids compiling straight to JavaScript<br/><br/>Luke:
	- to PIL first
	- then we get JavaScript automatically!<br/><br/>c:
	- also Perl 5!  yay!<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- when did you pull from blead?
	- not sure how painful the merge back will be<br/><br/>Larry:
	- I'm at 5.9.2 at the moment
	- it ought to be mergeable
	- this hairy dance back and forth between the program which does the
	  final translation and the internal code which spits out the initial XML
	- my basic philosophy is to make minimal changes to the Perl core
	- to what extent you just mark up the things as they're going out and
	  messing up the tree versus intuiting what should have been there...
	- only time will tell whether I made the right decisions
	- I figured that you can drive it one way or another
	- one way and you break the semantics of existing code too much
	- "Just don't do constant folding" breaks plenty of things, such as
	  interpolated constant subroutines
	- too much guessing after the fact means I may not have guessed correctly
	- there are intermediate forms in there too
	- go ahead and keep the same structure
	- then annotate it with just a little extra type information for the
	  backend
	- I've been doing that compromise more and more
	- seems to work out pretty well
	- the ordinary regression tests have two or three failures that need
	  fixing before the merge
	- I don't test that part of it as often as I test the translator<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- I bet we can find some help to deal with that<br/><br/>c:
	- checked in Test::More in PIR
	- talked to Jerry Gay and it looks like we have an easy way to add PIR
	  tests to the Perl testing harness
	- I'll check in some of my library tests and see how that works
	- should let us rely on those a little bit more</p>
