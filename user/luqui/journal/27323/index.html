Larry:
	- trying to figure out types
	- and everything else
	- rewriting the world
	- put out new versions of S02 and S06
	- already have things I want to change<br/><br/>Luke:
	- good thing committing only takes a couple of seconds<br/><br/>Larry:
	- also I was in Hungary
	- it was thirsty
	- they apparently don't believe in caffeine there
	- I spent a goodly part of that with a headache
	- the conference was pretty okay
	- getting ready to give a talk to HP on Thursday<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- Perl 6-ish?<br/><br/>Larry:
	- variant of my 9.3 State of the Onion talk that I gave at EuroOSCON
	- it'll be by teleconference
	- my slides will be a Java app running in everyone's browser
	- part of the reason I did EuroOSCON with just words is that I wanted it
	  to still work in case everything blew up<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- I'm pleased using the Takahashi method Autrijus found
	- it just works
	- I can edit them in a text editor<br/><br/>Larry:
	- the named arguments are now marked with colon instead of plus<br/><br/>Luke:
	- makes many people happy<br/><br/>Larry:
	- probably the type sigil is up arrow, rather than a cent sign
	- as in caret
	- we're trying to iron out all of our terminology for what's a class and
	  what's an abstract class that isn't really a class
	- probably relates to Luke's "a class is not anything"
	- think we're making good progress on that
	- looks like I'll be home for the next couple of months
	- I'll probably accept a position at the place where I'm currently
	  consulting
	- I'll still be spending the majority of my time on Perl 6<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- checked in my shift/reduce parser last night
	- busy cleaning it up
	- it works pretty nicely
	- getting ready to parse all sorts of Perl 6 expressions
	- then I found a segfault (which I reported earlier)
	- I think I'll be able to parse out most Perl 6 expressions now
	- including all of the weird whitespace things<br/><br/>Larry:
	- can that all be in one spot, like we talked about?<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- yes
	- register a token and specify if it's whitespace okay or not
	- if you need to do fancy things from the bottom-up parser, you can
	  always call a rule
	- it tells the shift/reduce parser "this is what I have, now continue on"<br/><br/>Larry:
	- okay
	- does the rule vs. token distinction we discussed make sense in this
	  context?<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- for general in Perl 6 rules?
	- not at the moment
	- I like the way :w works in general
	- pretty nice way of doing it
	- :r :t that Damian proposed didn't do anything for me for these things
	  that I needed to parse<br/><br/>(On the cabal list we have been discussing separating the concepts of rule and token for whitespace dwimmery purposes. -L)<br/><br/>	- now I'm working on parsing out the ternary operator
	- think I have that working in the past five minutes
	- next steps are to test and check in some examples
	- Perl 6 expressions, Perl 6 rules, general expressions
	- parsing gives you a nice match tree with the nodes in the right place
	- useful starting place for figuring out the tree transformations we need
	  to do
	- especially true for the grammar engine itself
	- once I parse it out to the tree, we want a bunch of transformations and
	  optimizations
	- I'll write PIR code that does that for now
	- we can catalog those we need and how we might want our TTL to look<br/><br/>Larry:
	- and not box ourselves in so we can't use "use" statements<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- also promised to update the milestones document for PGE today or tonight
	- just haven't done it yet by being too busy writing code<br/><br/>Allison:
	- sent a patch to p6i to update the opcode mismatch error message<br/><br/>c:
	- not sure that's the right approach
	- I like your second suggestion better
	- I can look at it if you like<br/><br/>Allison:
	- that's why I sent in the patch, not checking it in directly
	- this made my life easier though<br/><br/>Larry:
	- are these capturable by something running atop Parrot?<br/><br/>Allison:
	- it's an interpreter exception
	- working today on finishing the PIR attribute grammar implementation
	- coming along nicely
	- because of the closures issue, I've made it much more heavily OO
	- instead of relying on closures to capture a certain value, I'm passing
	  around relevant objects
	- AttributeGrammar::Rule object, for example
	- pass that down to where it needs the information<br/><br/>Luke:
	- might be a better approach, given Parrot's architecture<br/><br/>Allison:
	- seems to be working better in PIR<br/><br/>Luke:
	- which version are you interpreting?
	- I released a new one this week<br/><br/>Allison:
	- started with the old one
	- figure I'll update it later
	- the old one was simpler in the model
	- which parts did you change?<br/><br/>Luke:
	- completely rewrote it
	- most of the algorithm's semantics rely on the simple semantics of the
	  thunk
	- used to traverse the tree, find out the attributes, made thunks if I
	  need them
	- new version makes thunks for all the attributes it may need eventually,
	  starts with the first one, then goes on<br/><br/>c:
	- was this to help memory usage?<br/><br/>Luke:
	- yes
	- it's hard to tell when Perl cleans up memory
	- you can't use this technique verbatim in Parrot because of the
	  difference in how they handle pads
	- write destructor code that tells you when things are cleaned up<br/><br/>c:
	- it would be nice if destructors worked
	- last time I tried, they didn't
	- we need some sort of finalization and destruction
	- I want to release non-memory resources at a reliable, known point
	- I don't really care when Parrot GCs the dead object<br/><br/>Allison:
	- block exit, right?<br/><br/>c:
	- that's fine with me<br/><br/>Allison:
	- you want to know that you have reliable finalization at some point, not
	  necessarily at the same time as destruction
	- I'll check this into my personal repository tonight<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- I'll try to come up with an idea for a more public repository for this
	  sort of thing<br/><br/>Luke:
	- mostly school
	- lots of tests recently
	- rewrote the attribute grammar module
	- nice and memory-efficient, at least I think
	- algorithmically it has a better bound
	- also started the Perl 6 port of Language::AttributeGrammar
	- still thinking about how to do that given Perl 6's handling of pads
	- much different from Perl 5
	- think that's about it
	- attribute grammarsr are a great base for the tree transformation
	  language we're thinking about<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- I was in Stockholm for the Nordic Perl Workshop
	- presented 205 slides in 23 minutes
	- missed the implementation meeting, but it happened
	- need to send out mail about the upcoming time change
	- that's it from my side<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- Allison, are you waiting on anything from PGE on what you're doing?<br/><br/>Allison:
	- I'm doing the part that doesn't depend on PGE right now
	- after I finish the port, then I'll start trying out transforming PGE
	  trees<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- I'll send you some PGE trees then<br/><br/>Luke:
	- I heard that Larry and Autrijus did some work on tuples
	- I'd like to see a summary of that<br/><br/>Larry:
	- read S02 and S06
	- basically the tuple constructor we stole with \()
	- we didn't think that we should throw regular parens at that
	- the signature constructor is different from that
	- it's still :()
	- a tuple is parsed rvalues
	- a signature parses differently
	- that's how it currently sits
	- also there's no special casing about having a comma on the end
	- the fact that you are passing it to a function makes it a tuple
	- the recognizer for a tuple in a signature is also a backwhacked variable
	- Autrijus talked about that part of it
	- the slurpy scalar will just slurp one argument at the top level
	- I'm sure you'll find other stuff out there, some of which is probably
	  bogus<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- not much conferency coming up<br/><br/>Allison:
	- MIT's Little Languages workshop may be the first week of December
	- at least, I hope it is<br/><br/></p>
