Allison:
	- almost finished with the tree transformation thing that takes a grammar
	- last remaining piece is tricky
	- if you use compreg and compile a subroutine on the fly from a string of
	  PIR text, can you have parameters in that?
	- can you accept subroutine parameters?
	- do you have to declare it as a named subroutine?<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- you have to compile it as a named subroutine
	- you can make it anonymous
	- give it a name, but put :anon pragma after it<br/><br/>Allison:
	- that's exactly what I need<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- you get back a PMC that you can call like any other subroutine in a PMC<br/><br/>Allison:
	- I'll have a version of the engine that uses grammars by the end of this
	  call
	- parses the tree grammar file using PGE
	- does a tree transformation on the match result
	- then loops through the tree (an array of rules, where each rule is a
	  hash)
	- compiles rules for an attribute grammar from that result
	- you can compile from a tree grammar file to a working tree grammar
	- you use a tree grammar to use this<br/><br/>Luke:
	- an abstract syntax?<br/><br/>Allison:
	- your attribute grammar
	- I can create that from a syntax file
	- I do that using attribute grammars<br/><br/>Luke:
	- for me, it ended up being less readable than doing it by hand
	- but it's fun to bootstrap<br/><br/>Allison:
	- it was my way of testing if I can use an attribute grammar
	- before I put it into the repository, I want to make sure that I can
	  parse the output from a PGE match and transform it
	- this proves that that is possible
	- also Roberta and I finished our final draft of the Artistic Licence 2.0
	  and the contributor agreement
	- the next step is to solicit reviews from a few interested parties,
	  including the patent lawyer
	- then we'll do a general public review<br/><br/>Nick:
	- will Perl 5 come under this agreement as well?<br/><br/>Allison:
	- we took that into account for the contributor agreement<br/><br/>Nick:
	- can you have the Perl 5 cabal review it too?<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- PGE has grown by leaps and bounds
	- converted it to use a shift-reduce parser internally
	- everyone else can use that parser
	- probably 25% shorter in parsing code, much faster
	- also added support for custom whitespace rules
	- create a grammar with its own <ws> rule
	- now does closures; can embed them in a rule
	- can specify what language it'll send to which Parrot compiler<br/><br/>Luke:
	- can you give it a lexical pad to start with?
	- does Parrot already do that?<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- haven't done anything with that yet
	- shouldn't be hard
	- we can do whatever we want
	- I'm still waiting for the dust to settle on the design<br/><br/>Luke:
	- suppose I wrote a lexer for a LALR(1) grammar?
	- can I have PGE understand that?<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- as long as it understands match objects
	- you can control how it handles tokens
	- "give me a match object"
	- "call this subroutine which tells me how much to consume"
	- the subroutine can be a rule
	- go from recursive-descent to shift-reduce or vice versa at any point
	- we don't have to worry about backtracking over Perl comments, for
	  example
	- they're atomic
	- pretty straightforward<br/><br/>Luke:
	- can you commit yet?
	- will that allow us to clean up memory that we don't need?<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- not yet
	- but I know how to do it
	- you can take any match object and call the same rule
	- it gives you a match object that starts there
	- drop the old object and the GC will clean it up
	- continue from where that match started
	- I can build that trivially in about 15 minutes now
	- I did lookaheads
	- I'll do lookbehinds in the near future, with a naive implementation
	- particle on IRC has committed around 200 tests for PGE
	- I'll clear off a lot of the TODOs there to reward him for his work there
	- my next plan is to start parsing Perl 6 expressions
	- I'll go as far as possible
	- should be able to go quite a ways
	- already an expressions parser in the examples directory
	- you can get back a parse tree with precedence taken into account
	- now that that's a rule, I'll start working on statements
	- we'll see where it goes from there
	- probably can produce fairly complete parse trees for Perl 6 programs in
	  two weeks
	- may not have all of the esoterics in there, but most will be available
	- one question
	- I can fairly rapidly build an interpreter based on the match tree
	- is that a direction to bother going down?<br/><br/>Allison:
	- it would be useful just in a sense of having bits and pieces being
	  usable right away<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- that's the way I want to go
	- I'll start building an interpreter
	- it may be slow
	- my intermediate goal is to get the language interpreter far enough along
	  that it can run the Pugs test harness<br/><br/>Luke:
	- that's what Pugs did for a while
	- that sucks
	- all of your special cases get into the big, bloated runtime<br/><br/>Allison:
	- we're working on the syntax tree at the same time
	- we will do that
	- it's just nice to have something running<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- I think Luke means "don't go too far with it"<br/><br/>Luke:
	- you don't want to go too far in that direction
	- people could spend their time adding features to a bloated interpreter
	  rather than building a small, scalable one
	- where do you stop?
	- where do you throw it out and start with PIL?<br/><br/>Allison:
	- when I push the tree transformations two steps further and Patrick can
	  use that instead of the interpreter<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- PIL and the interpreter aren't entirely in conflict
	- my goal is the compiler
	- I don't want to target PIL directly
	- I need something to evaluate my syntax trees relatively interesting<br/><br/>Luke:
	- you don't want to go too far, like Pugs in throwing so much away<br/><br/>Allison:
	- the best way to check the grammar and PGE is to have something that
	  actually works while he's at it<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- you can help out, Luke
	- when you think it's going too far, say so<br/><br/>Luke:
	- it goes too far with other contributors, not you<br/><br/>Allison:
	- we don't really have other contributors now<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- we could get some very quickly<br/><br/>Luke:
	- "thanks for your help, but we're throwing it away now"<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- we'll just tell them up front
	- I'll create a new languages/ directory so it's clear it's not the
	  official Perl 6 system
	- we will watch for that very carefully
	- if this system doesn't have a release schedule but the Perl 6 compiler
	  does, it'll be clearer about our priorities<br/><br/>Luke:
	- okay
	- one more thing though
	- Perl 6 is a complex language
	- I think that interpreter will be bigger than you expect it to be<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- I don't expect to write a complete interpreter
	- I expect to write enough to get me to a compiler in a comfortable
	  environment
	- after writing PGE as a compiler, I know that's how I want to go<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- describing it as a development aid and experiment might help<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- I'm planning to send out an e-mail later tonight if I can stop coding
	  long enough to document things<br/><br/>Luke:
	- I'm happy that everyone else is making good progress
	- I didn't this week mostly because of school
	- I was going to write a couple of things, but they're still on my queue
	- also going to port Language::AttributeGrammar to Perl 6<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- are you blocking on anything else?<br/><br/>Luke:
	- only learning my way around the new Parrot<br/><br/>c:
	- working on the book
	- writing a proof of concept in Perl 5 that I can port to PIR pretty
	  easily
	- requires the OpenGL bindings<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- are those maintained?<br/><br/>c:
	- I have a proof of concept on my hard drive
	- I think it'll be pretty easy
	- don't need to wrap them in a nice interface as I did SDL
	- should be a quick port<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- Autrijus and Liz have been enumerating their desires for S17 and
	  concurrency in Perl 6
	- once they feel like they have a draft they like, should they send it to
	  the cabal and ask where to go from there?
	- maybe the answer will be "no, this isn't what we want!"<br/><br/>Allison:
	- yes, that is the right way to go<br/><br/>Nick:
	- I remember discussions from Perl 5 several years ago
	- someone needs to go over the proposal and see if there are portability
	  problems and guarantees
	- they're talking about STM for this
	- seems like a disconnect between what Ponie wants
	- the fact that everything in Ponie goes through a vtable means that
	  there's no speed hit for going through non-shared code
	- there'll probably need to be the concept of closing in Parrot
	- as soon as you start a thread, you'll have to replace the parent vtables
	  with shared ones
	- this probably needs Chip
	- don't know how much Chip has thought about it yet<br/><br/>Allison:
	- it sounds like the right thing to do is to pass the draft around to
	  everyone who's thought about threading in Perl 5<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- next week, the call will be at the DST time
	- 10 pm UK
	- GMT now</p>
