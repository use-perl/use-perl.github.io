c:
	- Stevan and Audrey are working on PIL2 minilanguage
	- they want to talk about how to optimize it
	- I'll corner Allison and have her show me how to hook it up to TGE<br/><br/>Allison:
	- probably won't have my Parrot day until Friday
	- I still plan on working next on supporting more operations in Punie
	- probably will do a whole pile at once
	- I need to genericize it not to parse on the name of the operation
	- "there's an identifier here"
	- then add a step to do semantic checking
	- check for only valid operations<br/><br/>c:
	- sounds like what PIL2 needs<br/><br/>Allison:
	- very co-useful<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- is Roberta back in town?<br/><br/>Allison:
	- we're supposed to talk to a Perl-friendly company soon
	- not sure if it'll work during the holidays
	- will send out a few more review copies<br/><br/>Luke:
	- I'm porting PGE to Perl 6
	- it's really fast
	- I can do the fundamental operations in an hour
	- haven't found the easiest way
	- will probably look at how PGE does it
	- using CPS, as it's easy for the easy stuff
	- the general quantified style isn't as easy that way
	- coming along a really well
	- Perl 6 is a nice language to write in, compared to PIR<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- is this as an exercise for fun?
	- is it for a chunk of Pugs?
	- does it eventually need to happen?<br/><br/>Luke:
	- all three
	- our best backend, which is JavaScript right now, doesn't even have rules
	- that needs to happen to get stuff out fast<br/><br/>Allison:
	- if the lowest level you guarantee to support is the HLL, you have to
	  implement a lot of stuff in the HLL to support it everywhere<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- what's your status of outstanding design decisions?
	- it'd be nice to get a concrete list of missing design
	- what we need for 6.0
	- it seems like that'll become a list of blockers soon
	- we're getting runnable implementations that run<br/><br/></p>
