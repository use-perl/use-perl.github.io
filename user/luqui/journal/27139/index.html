<p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Larry:
	- made it back safely from the cruise
	- madly working
	- hanging out on the lists a little bit
	- haven't had enough time to think through the things I want to think
	  through<br/><br/>Luke:
	- started the rewrite of attribute grammars module
	- won't eat up memory as much
	- spent hours trying to debug a nasty bug<br/><br/>Larry:
	- a Perl 5 bug?<br/><br/>Luke:
	- no, in my code somewhere
	- also talking with Stevan about the metamodel
	- trying to unify that in my head with theories
	- not working very well
	- but I realize that the theory proposes a type system
	- the metamodel proposes an object system<br/><br/>c:
	- and a reflection system<br/><br/>Luke:
	- Autrijus says he'll talk to Larry in person at EuroOSCON
	- I'll follow along on IRC to catch type annotation stuff<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- working on PGE some more
	- tracked down and fixed a problem with Parrot's coroutine handling
	- rewriting PGE captures code so that match objects are true to what they
	  ought to be
	- clean it up, make it faster, make it more accurate
	- working on shift/reduce parser component
	- this first ought to produce Perl 6 rules
	- the recursive descent part is actually the slowest part of the current
	  process<br/><br/>Larry:
	- surprise, surprise<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- in the process, I find that match trees look like something I need to do
	  tree transforms on
	- expect to have a real-world example in the next week or so
	- we could look at using attribute grammars on it soon
	- I'll be publishing the start and the end and the necessary
	  transformations
	- then we can look at them
	- looking at a port of Text::Balanced
	- turned out to be fairly easy to do in Parrot now
	- also posted several questions on the list<br/><br/>Larry:
	- haven't had time to go through the whole document yet<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- do the docs need updating to reflect that?<br/><br/>Larry:
	- undoubtedly<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- Damian has drafts of those
	- I went through them in some detail
	- his latest drafts looked pretty complete to me
	- just looking for confirmation on various things
	- I can pull out the outstanding issues if you need them
	- Damian has another draft I think
	- could use an opinion on letting whitespace before a quantifier imply a
	  <ws> rule<br/><br/>Larry:
	- in the absence of a better idea, run with it<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- if we put a quantifier on a subrule
	- the quantifier doesn't include any whitespace between them
	- if you put space between the subrule and the quantifier
	- currently it's meaningless
	- what if it put a whitespace rule between each instance?<br/><br/>Luke:
	- maybe a good temporary idea
	- maybe we're approaching the :w thing from the wrong direction
	- all other context-free approaches try it upside-down from us
	- for quick regexes without many calls to subrules, we're good
	- for context-free things, a completely different semantic may be much
	  handier<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- we may need both<br/><br/>Allison:
	- had a question for Patrick about my PIR code
	- will e-mail him when I remember<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- more chatter in the implementation meeting
	- Chip's working on the PDDs
	- Leo and Nick both seem to be waiting on bits of design
	- maybe need someone to put together questions which various design docs
	  need to say
	- Chip would find it easier to write them by answering questions rather
	  than working in a vacuum
	- might need to find some volunteers for them
	- been posting transcripts and links to the implementation notes on
	  use.perl.org<br/><br/>Luke:
	- posted a request for comments on annotations to p6l
	- the people on the "programming left" responded
	- "I don't want any type errors anywhere"
	- didn't really generate any interesting thoughts
	- mostly a mood-generating thought
	- are there any ideas about the integration between annotated and
	  unannotated code?<br/><br/>Larry:
	- seems like one of those things the user deserves to give a knob
	- what the default setting is<br/><br/>Luke:
	- it's not a trivial knob
	- you're working with a complex system
	- Autrijus and I talked about this some on IRC
	- before we figure out the big issues, we have to figure out the little
	  issues<br/><br/>c:
	- would it be helpful to come up with examples where the syntax,
	  semantics, and behavior might be a problem?<br/><br/>Luke:
	- that was what my thread tried to do, but it didn't go there<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- everything gets more complex in the middle ground
	- we're not going all type-checked
	- some people never want type checking
	- most people are probably in the middle
	- people need more time to think about that<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- is there anything besides free time that are blocking you?<br/><br/>Larry:
	- brain cells<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- daylight savings time changes are coming
	- we should figure out the implication
	- the calls will be earlier<br/><br/>Allison:
	- last year we postponed the change until December<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- I'll send mail about the time change
	- we'll figure out something that works
