<p>(Sorry, forgot to post these last week)<br/><br/>Luke:
	- until last Wednesday, I worked on PGE in Perl 6
	- then I worked on something completely unrelated
	- PGE in Perl 6 now, barring the operator precedence parser, does
	  everything that the Parrot one does
	- except for parsing rules
	- but Audrey is doing that<br/><br/>c:
	- does it produce match objects like PGE does?<br/><br/>Luke:
	- yes
	- last week I thought about things
	- XQuery, tree matching
	- pondering a data comprehension module for Perl 5
	- whatever can make processing big, complex data structures quick and easy
	- working with Audrey on context and coercion
	- we have some disagreements about how that works
	- mostly we're on the same page
	- wrote a document describing pure MMD scheme
	- including return type dispatch
	- related to context
	- those are in the Pugs repository
	- I'll hack on them and then pass them along<br/><br/>Larry:
	- did about 18 refactorings of the Perl 5 to Perl 5 translator
	- ends up with a more adequately typed AST<br/><br/>Luke:
	- typed how?<br/><br/>Larry:
	- I'm not quite sure what I mean either
	- a lot of the stuff internally to Perl is implicit
	- there's no name for a particular node in the tree
	- they happen accidentally
	- we rearrange kids somehow and change a few flags and it applies
	  differently
	- trying to name everything, or at least get close
	- they're types in that sense
	- it's not yet well-typed in the sense that I've looked at those names
	  and tried to figure out what's common between them
	- it's nothing like PIL
	- it's just trying to give a name to everything so we can have a hope at
	  translating at some point
	- basically there are more node types currently than there are operator
	  ppcodes in Perl 5
	- there's now a Statement, which doesn't really exist
	- there's an opcode for transitioning into a statement in Perl 5
	- but nothing really contains a statement
	- that's a lot of the refactoring work
	- make a more ordered tree
	- now, of all the tests in the core modules, it translates more than 99.5%
	  correctly
	- I haven't tried CPAN; I'd have to download it
	- I also haven't bothered to try to hook this up to bleadperl
	- I can probably delegate that eventually
	- most of these refactorings come about due to thinking about what I need
	  to translate to Perl 6
	- making sure that the information is there
	- haven't actually tried to translate anything yet
	- eventually I'll get up the courage to translate $foo[] to @foo[] and go
	  from there
	- otherwise, thinking about what people say on the mailing lists
	- admittedly not being very responsive to that<br/><br/>Allison:
	- planning to take time off around Christmas to do development
	- but I had my wisdom teeth out
	- started working on expanding the Punie grammar again
	- made it into sexpr part of the original perly.y
	- ran into the traditional left recursion problem
	- decided to use PGE's operator precedence parser instead<br/><br/>Luke:
	- with regard to left recursion, there's a simple transform you can do
	  with closures to turn right-recursion data structures into ones that
	  look like left recursion<br/><br/>Allison:
	- rather than doing left recursion, I flipped around
	- broke it into two pieces
	- the first element, and the rest of the expression<br/><br/>Luke:
	- x [\+ x]* ?<br/><br/>Allison:
	- expression matches
	- expression = expression
	- expression = expression + expression
	- instead, say expression = term + rexpression<br/><br/>Luke:
	- that's my biggest complaint about Parse::RecDescent
	- it has a nice leftop which does that
	- but then you get back a flat structure of all the matches you want
	- I want a left recursive structure
	- it's easier to parse things that look left-recursive
	- you only have to handle two arguments, not N
	- left-recursion transform might be nice in grammars, if it's generic...<br/><br/>Allison:
	- for now, all I need in Perl 1 is operator precedence
	- looks pretty cool so far
	- I'll try to finish it off by the end of the day
	- it'd be nice to have comments in the syntax of the independent grammar,
	  but...<br/><br/>Luke:
	- my friend the crazy C++ programmer is trying to learn a new language
	- I invited him to learn Perl 6
	- I'm going to try to teach him Perl 6 without any past knowledge of
	  dynamic languages
