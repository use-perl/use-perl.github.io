<p>Luke<br/><br/>* Working out final bugs in theory Theory.
* Getting ready to write his proposal
* Covers a lot of ground<br/><br/>Jesse<br/><br/>* It presents a unifying theory of things that already conform to it?<br/><br/>Luke<br/><br/>* Yes. as well as adding more nice stuff. Still working on a few bugs.
* Also thinking about junctions
* Trying to find a new version of my proposal that makes everybody happy
* That's about it
* Started a use.perl journal
* Posted edited minutes from last week.<br/><br/>Patrick<br/><br/>* Mostly, reading and musing on larry's posts to 6perl regarding tree transform language
* Simletaniously frightend and other things.
* Agrees with allison - doesn't feel like perl
* may just not feel like the perl i'm used to<br/><br/>Luke<br/><br/>* As I see it, the problemspace is different than what you're used to.
* Feels too formal for perl, but it's really quite concise and wonderful<br/><br/>P:<br/><br/>* Relative to haskell?<br/><br/>L:<br/><br/>* No, it's just like haskell, and haskell is good at it.
* This is why i asked allison what she wants to do with trees
* She wants to change it in a small way or transform it to a new tree with a different structure.<br/><br/>
J:<br/><br/>* Is this going to change how people work with XML<br/><br/>P:<br/><br/>* The primary goal is for compiler implementaiton, but I think we'd like to make it more general a tool than we've had in the past.<br/><br/>* It doesn't bother the haskell folks, but it feels like we've got too many parens. I sort of wonder if we should branch out into unicode.
* Too many colons, too.
* That's a question I'm going to propose to sixperl.<br/><br/>L:
* The theory proposal covers this somewhat, too. We'll see how it works out.
* We need to figure out what transformations you want to do and then figure out how you want to write them.<br/><br/>P: [ missed a bit here. sorry]<br/><br/>
Jesse:<br/><br/>* This week's implementor's meeting was a bit sparsely attended, but we're hoping for more next week.<br/><br/>* [goes on to ramble a bit about P6 project management, what it might possibly mean to "finish" the design for 6.0 and how we can possibly find a sucker who's willing to define how threads will work.]</p>

But why are these being put in a blog when they should be put up in a prominant section of the P6/TPF website that has long been very quiet and very low on any real information? I keep hoping that someday someone will get their shit together and instead of focusing on logos and press releases will care about the things that people have been waiting to hear about for years. YEARS.

<p>TPF has routinely had people volunteer for this sort of work and drop it.  Over and over and over.  Then people yell at us because no one wants to do it.  They get all upset that the information isn't presented the way they want it, but they won't help.  Of course, I understand that not everyone is in a position to help.  They have family, or they have some obscure clause in their employment contract or they simply don't want to (which is OK, I understand), and I <em>do want people to keep reminding us of where we can improve</em>, but this is, in my humble opinion, one of the biggest obstacles for the TPF:  finding people who have the time and the desire to do stuff like this.  Whipping volunteers and yelling "faster" generally results in fewer volunteers.</p>

<p>If anyone has a solution for the "let's make unpaid workers more productive problem", I would love to hear it.  I mean <em>specific</em> solutions.  The ones I hear are usually management-speak like "leverage your resources better" or "the competition did, so can we!"  Name names.  Say "connect X to Y".  Explain how we can have Person A do $foo and Person B do $bar and have everyone happy.</p>

<p>I hope you don't take this personally.  I do agree with what you're saying.  We just need to figure out the best way to solve a problem that many other open-source projects have.  If you're willing to volunteer, we could use the help<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p>

Here's one: enable some form of blogging/wiki on the TPF site.<br><br>Perhaps simply by having a TPF blog on use.perl.org and a link on the TPF site that points to it.<br>
