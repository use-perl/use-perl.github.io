<div class="span8">
<p>Here are the notes from today's conference call.<br/><br/>Larry:
	- mostly thinking about the things Luke has sent out
	- stuff on the mailing lists
	- not much to report beyond what you've seen
	- read the Scala paper
	- my eyes glazed over in certain spots<br/><br/>Luke:
	- it's a little dense<br/><br/>Larry:
	- we have to find a different name than "data"
	- no, you can't have vertical bar
	- I think "data" is actively misleading to blue-collar people
	- it's a little more abstract than that
	- more like "a pattern of data"<br/><br/>Luke:
	- a structure... a struct!<br/><br/>Larry:
	- if you have a theory, then they're tenets, aren't they?<br/><br/>Luke:
	- mostly thinking about the things I've been sending out
	- started to implement some of the stuff I've proposed to see how it works
	- tried to start as Perl 5 modules
	- inevitably led me back to my type inferencer work
	- I want strong typing without verbosity
	- working on that again
	- trying to get an algorithm for type inferencing that doesn't require
	  monotypes
	- (I think they're too restrictive)
	- it can check for errors
	- not sure how to make it faster with the information it has, but...
	- also think I used "theory" in two different ways in my post
	- parameterized theory is more like a role or a multi-parameter interface
	- the one from Scala is really more like a module
	- basically trying to figure out how you extend a module and what makes
	  sense there<br/><br/>Larry:
	- and if you poke multis into a role can you put them into a module?
	- what we call them doesn't matter as much as what happens when you do
	  things with them<br/><br/>Luke:
	- kind of want a global type for things
	- for multis
	- along with your operator-central language idea
	- if you have a global type for plus that says "These things have to
	  implement the Num theory", then you can't override plus non-numerically
	  without fixing the global type<br/><br/>Larry:
	- fits in with what Yuval was saying
	- have your cake with performance and extensibility at the same time in
	  different lexical scopes
	- I'm in favor of both performance and extensibility<br/><br/>Luke:
	- who isn't, except for Java<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- Luke, you were going to do summaries for these calls
	- have you been doing that?<br/><br/>Luke:
	- I did it twice and sent it to not-Piers but he didn't include it, so I
	  became lazy<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- if we want to make them publicly available, you might be able to post
	  them to your use Perl; journal
	- it takes 30 seconds to make an account
	- we don't have to rely on the summarizers to include it
	- at least we're talking
	- seem to have managed to get the implementors in one virtual room weekly
	  for the past four weeks or so
	- seemed to work best this past week
	- but there was a fairly large queue of questions built up
	- Chip, Patrick, Autrijus, Nick, Matt Diephouse, chromatic, Allison,
	  myself
	- went through what people have done in the past week
	- more importantly, talking about what they're sticking on
	- mostly a result of having enough people say "I'm waiting for this from
	  that person" that I had the audacity to try to get these people in one
	  place
	- much of this week was Nick tying Chip down and asking question after
	  question for Ponie
	- Patrick mentioned that S05 is out of date with the state of the universe<br/><br/>Larry:
	- I'm through S04 in the state of my revisions<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- someone suggested goading Damian into updating this
	- maybe it's you, Larry
	- maybe it's someone else<br/><br/>Allison:
	- at one point Damian said he'd do it
	- maybe check and see if he's still interested<br/><br/>Luke:
	- what about Patrick?<br/><br/>Allison:
	- he doesn't have time<br/><br/>Larry:
	- he's doing real work<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- he says that if it continues to bite him, he might just cope
	- he prefers that Damian, being responsible for the change proposal, do it
	- I'll harass Damian today (via e-mail)
	- I've sent out full transcripts of the sessions to sixperl
	- people wanted unedited logs instead of trimmed minutes
	- also talking to Nick about how to get Ponie moving faster
	- trying to get some parallelizable Ponie tasks
	- he feels that everything is on a critical path on what he needs to do
	- one thing other people can do is to get Parrot signals in the right
	  place
	- it's hard to embed Parrot and expect signals to do the right thing
	- this needs a PDD
	- don't know if anything has happened in the past couple of weeks with
	  Chip and contributing draft PDDs
	- seems something Ponie-related that someone who is not Nick could do<br/><br/>Allison:
	- is it possible to define someone to put up the templates?<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- I mailed Chip over the weekend
	- he's moving now
	- I'll give him a bit longer before prodding again
	- I don't know whether the wrong thing is wiki with authentication or
	  Subversion access or what<br/><br/>Allison:
	- started hacking on an AST this weekend, written as Parrot objects<br/><br/>Luke:
	- then you have a good idea of what you want to do with trees<br/><br/>Allison:
	- yes
	- I hadn't yet read that message<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- did API changes come up at the London meet?
	- we've run into this with RT every month and a half
	- one of our dependencies changes its API
	- people install old versions of RT with old "stable" versions of
	  dependencies<br/><br/>Larry:
	- the long-term solution is that the version number is part of the name<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- is there a medium-term solution that anyone has?<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- seriously considering branching CPAN for distribution as part of our
	  tree
	- I did not say fork
	- we played with importing all of Backpan into an SVN repository
	- it suffers from the same problem that search does
	- it doesn't respect permissions on who can upload a module
	- ends up slightly smaller than the tarred distribution of all of the
	  modules

<h2>Summarizing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pdcawley/">pdcawley</a> on 2005-09-15T01:43:48</h3>
If you CC !(!Piers) he'll try and include 'em in the summaries he writes.



<h2>Thank you so much!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/acme/">acme</a> on 2005-09-15T13:49:52</h3>
I've been aware that there is a weekly Perl 6 conference call for a long time now and have tried to find out what goes on during it. Thanks for actually writing it up!



<h2>If you were talking about Test::Inline...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2005-09-22T16:08:10</h3>
For the record, at no time during my upgrade of Test::Inline to Test::Inline 2 did any API anywhere change.<br><br>Those things you heard breaking were people's incorrect dependency specifications being whacked with the reality stick.<br><br>There was no such thing as Test::Inline until 2.0 except an empty file with some POD in it...
