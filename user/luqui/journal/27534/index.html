<p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Patrick:
	- lots more stuff with PGE
	- sent out a message on Friday
	- now support for commit operator, Unicode characters (as far as Parrot
	  can), hex, octal, newline, conjunctions, subrules with arguments,
	  documented public interface
	- it helps that particle has created so many tests
	- so have the Tcl guys
	- beyond that, just catching up with Chip's draft design documents
	- going to do parser things next<br/><br/>Allison:
	- working on the tree grammar stuff
	- have it checked into my local mirror
	- haven't merged it back into mainline yet
	- Parrot has some extraneous requirements on new files
	- converting some of my little test scripts to test files
	- I couldn't run tests until I added libraries into Parrot repository
	- Patrick, what's your advice on where to put the test files?
	- PGE keeps the test files in the Parrot hierarchy
	- for the language, I want the tests in the languages/ directory<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- PGE's tests went in the Parrot thing because of Dan's advice
	- PGE is a part of Parrot
	- I separated them out as p6rules tests
	- there are several different syntaxes to do pattern matching
	- Perl 5 rules, for example
	- in this case, if we consider TGE as a part of Parrot, then it goes in
	  the Parrot repository
	- or sensibly a subdirectory in compilers/ subdirectory<br/><br/>Allison:
	- I'll do that for now
	- it's not a big deal to move them later<br/><br/>Larry:
	- some overhead with work and family
	- otherwise hanging out on p6l and p6c
	- thinking about design issues for roles and things
	- thinking about some of Patrick's regexp issues too
	- actually writing a few Perl 6 programs to see if it feels right
	- running into interesting Pugs bugs there
	- also playing with attribute grammar stuff and thinking about tree
	  transformation syntax<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- did Autrijus send out the doc that he and Liz have started to put
	  together about concurrency?<br/><br/>Larry:
	- I didn't see it<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- I encouraged them to show it to people who've done stuff in Perl 5
	- then make it public
	- how's the response to licensing stuff been, Allison?<br/><br/>Allison:
	- just a handful of responses
	- most questions were from the Perl 5 cabal about the amount of time
	  required to turn in their agreements
	- they wanted more than a week
	- it'll be more like six months<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- it should last through at least a conference season for in person
	  haranguing<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- I thought it looked clear and well-defined
	- I wish other open source licenses were as clear as this one<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- the only one that blew me away was Microsoft's clear and simple group of
	  licenses<br/><br/>Larry:
	- I've been trying to recompile Pugs
	- I get a weird message from GHC about unrecognized "-i" flags
	- GHC 6.4.1
	- one of these years I'll have to start submitting some tests myself<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- have you been submitting bug reports?<br/><br/>Larry:
	- I mentioned one on the list
	- I don't know what my commit procedure would be
	- I haven't taken anyone up on a commit bit<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- I can make sure that you get relevant documentation
	- that'll make the Pugs crowd very happy<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- I'm still eager for S05 to show up<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- Damian had taken that for comments?
 
Patrick:
 	- yes
	- I'm getting enough questions from people that it'd be nice to have a
	  document point to<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- is there any reason not to put a big warning on top of the last draft
	  and check it in?<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- I have no problem with that
	- the only thing that may change is the whitespace flags
	- we can put a notice around that
	- other than that, it looked good<br/><br/>Larry:
	- anything new is good<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- Damian has the latest draft<br/><br/>Larry:
	- what's the status of the S29 draft?<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- there's one in the Pugs repository
	- I could review it and pass it around<br/><br/>Larry:
	- at some point we should do it<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- I'll ask the Pugs folks about it
	- we can look at it<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- they have a couple of Synopses there waiting for approval
	- Autrijus, Jarkko, and Jos have started an updated CPAN synopsis</p>
