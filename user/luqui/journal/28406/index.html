<p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Luke:
	- I started school today
	- I have five hours in a row of classes
	- started to learn Scala outright, as if I were to program in it
	- I read three papers about its cool object model
	- it seems that it has every cool idea I've already thought of
	- the idea that a role isn't just an object really seems like a good idea
	  to me
	- they're not just for composing into classes
	- they're for composing into anything
	- a collection of stuff
	- I don't see any downsides except for the lack of strict subtyping
	- but there's a neat result: parameterized classes
	- they're the same as virtual classes
	- just make roles purely compositional
	- not subtyping things
	- eventually I'll write a document on my thoughts<br/><br/>c:
	- why do you lose subtyping?<br/><br/>Luke:
	- if you can compose anything, you can compose class names
	- you can compose those, you lose subtyping based on how that class is
	  used in the rest of that role
	- if you use the virtual class for argument types, you have to have a
	  contravariant relation<br/><br/>Larry:
	- busy with my day job
	- just keeping up with the mailing lists
	- I have another week or two of heavy duty work
	- eventually I'll get back to the translator
	- I have to prepare a talk for it for OSDC Israel
	- also thinking through how to make a lower impedence mismatch connection
	  between my AST and some of the Pugs projects<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- is it worth throwing random ASTs at them?<br/><br/>Larry:
	- not yet<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- did they convince you to visit Japan?<br/><br/>Larry:
	- didn't take much convincing<br/><br/>Allison:
	- haven't touched Punie in about three days
	- I finished off comma lists since last week
	- still haven't heard from Patrick
	- have other things I need to fix too
	- I might start on functions before operators
	- besides control structures, that's about it<br/><br/>c:
	- don't forget regexes
	- they gave me trouble<br/><br/>Allison:
	- I might just implement a compatibility layer<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- how's the licensing going?<br/><br/>Allison:
	- I'll release something within two weeks, even if I don't have comments
	  from everyone I asked to comment<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- sounds good<br/><br/>Damian:
	- working frantically to write a keynote for next week
	- involved a lot of photoshopping Peter Jackson
	- also negotiating with Japanese folks for the YAPC there
	- preparing for the talk has thrown up a lot of questions for the mailing
	  list
	- I'm still curious about a special way to declare class methods
	- Larry seems to be keen not to tie them down
	- there are a lot of people who'd like the option<br/><br/>Larry:
	- it can always be the option<br/><br/>Damian:
	- I'm trying to show syntax, though
	- I could just have a blurry screen
	- maybe I'll just show it with some fake syntax<br/><br/>Luke:
	- I couldn't come up with a good single word for that
	- Rob Kinyon kind of has a point with the polymorphism there<br/><br/>Larry:
	- more of a cultural one, as far as I see it<br/><br/>Damian:
	- no doubt about that
	- there are plenty of people who want to leave Java without leaving the
	  Java mindset<br/><br/>Larry:
	- it'd be interesting to see how much information the type inferencer
	  gives us for free<br/><br/>Luke:
	- it would be wise not to rely on it
	- there hasn't been much research into inferencing these type models<br/><br/>Damian:
	- even inferrence doesn't mark them physically in the syntax
	- people like that<br/><br/>Luke:
	- it's like Haskell
	- you don't have to put explicit types on your functions
	- but people do -- for documentation and future-proofness<br/><br/>Damian:
	- and checking your logic of the system
	- you're showing what you believe about a system<br/><br/>Luke:
	- Haskell will catch you eventually
	- but it won't point you to the right place without prototypes<br/><br/>Damian:
	- I almost had a bad moment and suggested "state"<br/><br/>Luke:
	- I don't understand how partially undefinedness supports prototype-based
	  OO
	- replying to Rob's thread might answer that<br/><br/>Larry:
	- I'll think about that<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- fighting with customers mostly this past week
	- went to the GPL v3 thing Monday and Tuesday
	- talking to potential Ponie contributors, but one fell through
	- two people are interested in hacking
	- they asked what there is to do
	- Jerry Gay is poking at getting a Windows box for regular Parrot builds<br/><br/></p>

<h2>Win32 builds</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2006-01-20T06:56:24</h3>
I've ordered a copy of the Microsoft Action Pack, which comes with pretty much "1 of everything" in terms of Win32 operating systems (although not CE).<br><br>I'm planning on hiring a uni student for a couple of weekends to install them all into system images, and then use those as a PITA test case, doing parrot builds on the entire Win32 family of OSes.<br>
