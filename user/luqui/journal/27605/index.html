Luke:
	- hacking on Pugs a lot
	- getting more comfortable with its internals
	- now Haskell itself isn't an issue
	- I just have to get my brain around Autrijus's brain, which is difficult
	- but it's coming along
	- thought also about the laws of Perl 6 builtins a little bit
	- I can't come up with anything<br/><br/>Larry:
	- it's like trying to think up the laws of English<br/><br/>Luke:
	- reading "Types and Programming Languages"
	- how would you implement an inferencer for a purely predicative system
	  like Theory?<br/><br/>Allison:
	- checked in TGE last week
	- that and refactoring and documentation took up my type last week
	- I missed the implementors meeting because I forgot about it
	- currently working on the AST in the Punie repository
	- using the tree grammar stuff there
	- I've just built up some node objects
	- building up a tree grammar to go from Punie PGE output to AST
	- the next step is nodes for the opcode syntax tree
	- another grammar to go from the AST to the OST
	- the last step is the little bit to compile the OST into Parrot
	- will probably do something similar to Leo's PAST prototype
	- it has the hooks for telling IMCC how to compile down a data structure<br/><br/>Larry:
	- I have a commit bit!
	- bright and shiny
	- I shall have to use it shortly
	- working on wreaking havoc on the Synopses this past week
	- Luke has been very helpful in getting me to clarify my thinking in
	  places where it's too muddy
	- other than that, just a lot of infrastructural things
	- getting the latest Parrot things
	- now I have bleadparrot and bleadpugs and everything
	- I can actually contribute on that level
	- mostly I think I'll just be looking at tests and things
	- checking validity
	- also learning XSLT
	- mostly because I don't think a language that that's ugly should be
	  able to do things that Perl can't
	- this fits into the tree transformation stuff
	- there are things it does better than attribute grammars
	- they seem not to handle lists of children well<br/><br/>Allison:
	- more toward named nodes<br/><br/>Larry:
	- that's something we have to fix
	- that's something XSLT does better<br/><br/>Luke:
	- attribute grammars aren't that good at looking around<br/><br/>Larry:
	- they're very constrained as to how you look around
	- there's some power in that<br/><br/>Luke:
	- have you seen CDuce?<br/><br/>Larry:
	- I haven't looked at it<br/><br/>Luke:
	- it has an interesting signature syntax<br/><br/>Larry:
	- now wait, I did look at it<br/><br/>Luke:
	- your list of predicate type signatures thing is reminiscent<br/><br/>Larry:
	- that was some of the grist
	- you're explicit about AND and OR in CDuce
	- I did look at that<br/><br/>c:
	- does XPath add better selectors to XSLT
	- or does it have better node selectors on its own?<br/><br/>Larry:
	- it's procedural, but more top-down<br/><br/>Luke:
	- sort of like a regular expression?<br/><br/>Larry:
	- yeah
	- sort of like a hierarchical SQL statement
	- we do need a better syntax than XML though
	- may take another whack at my Perl 5 -> Perl 5 thing
	- try to do that with XSLT instead of Perl<br/><br/>c:
	- that's what I tried to do a few years back
	- I learned that you can be right and still fail with bad code<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- primarily worked on S5
	- checked in the latest draft I sent out
	- it's not on the website yet<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- I believe Robert has a daily cron update<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- I'm happy to make corrections if anyone has comments<br/><br/>Larry:
	- you could make yourself the maintainer too<br/><br/>Damian:
	- I'm planning to send you some minor feedback<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- I also tried to reduce some redundancies
	- if I omitted anything, let me know
	- more updates to the grammar engine
	- now does lookbehinds, though it cheats for now
	- a variety of other small rules
	- mostly doing some internal Parrot things
	- driven by the desire to have Unicode work
	- better string escaping<br/><br/>Damian:
	- very good job on S5 too, by the way<br/><br/>Larry:
	- convenient, that he's the one implementing it<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- it's much easier to cut than it is to create<br/><br/>Larry:
	- for you, maybe
	- I'm too sentimental<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- give me a knife
	- I'm ruthless when it comes to prose<br/><br/>Luke:
	- speculating is too much fun<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- just catching up with other updates
	- continuing on with this path
	- one nice thing from the past week is the lexical stuff implementation
	- that's a big plus
	- it opens another door for me to continue pushing forward<br/><br/>Damian:
	- I've been busy
	- had the most appalling jetlag after I returned to Australia
	- this week I'm away teaching in Melbourne
	- next week too
	- earning a living gets in the way of *everything*
	- I have a whole backlog of postings to read and think about
	- especially from Larry
	- life stacks up while I'm traveling<br/><br/>c:
	- I poked at Parrot::Test a little bit
	- I'm stuck thinking about how to change STDOUT/STDERR<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- someone sent mail to TPF
	- an editor of the "For Dummies" books wants a date on Perl 6
	- Andy Lester asked me for completion or milestone dates
	- I've tended to stonewall on this
	- they're getting it cheap
	- we want it good
	- sticking dates on things won't do anyone any good
	- what do you think?<br/><br/>Allison:
	- that's what I've always said
	- we explicitly do not have scheduled dates
	- the editor in this case wanted to know if there'd be a release this year
	  or next<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- that's sort of a "maybe"<br/><br/>Luke:
	- not *this* year<br/><br/>Allison:
	- I told her there may be a beta at the end of next year
	- she wanted to know if she should publish a book on it now
	- my answer is no<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- is there any way that fixing dates to anything might help you all out?<br/><br/>*not really*<br/><br/>Allison:
	- I work on the internal date of "as soon as possible"<br/><br/>Luke:
	- it seems that putting pressure on people in OSS projects tends to make
	  them lose interest<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- I agree, but there are a few notable exceptions<br/><br/>Luke:
	- actually, when I have due dates for school, I work on Pugs!<br/><br/>c:
	- shave a yak, write Perl 6<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- is anyone blocking?
	- no answer makes my life better
	- okay, questions<br/><br/>Luke:
	- Patrick, Autrijus and I were talking about porting PGE to Perl 6
	- not for the fast side, but for the working side
	- supporting you get PGE stable, would you be interested in helping?<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- sure
	- it's stable now<br/><br/>Luke:
	- I thought so<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- you want a Perl 6 implementation?<br/><br/>Luke:
	- alternate runcores could use it then
	- even though it'd be slow<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- the biggest issue is being able to parse expressions into a match tree
	- I did the first version with a rec-descent parser
	- now it uses the precedence table which is much nicer
	- I'd have to look and see what it would take
	- I don't want to get sidetracked
	- but I can certainly help if you have questions
