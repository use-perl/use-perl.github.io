Larry:
	- I took Geneva to school last week
	- since then, I've been playing with a new IBM ThinkPad I received as a
	  gift<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- in addition to dual-booting, have you considered running VMWare?
	- maybe I can get you a copy<br/><br/>Larry:
	- I haven't used it since it became more corporate<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- I use it quite a bit on my systems
	- being able to copy and restore VMs is quite nice<br/><br/>Larry:
	- thinking about everything people talked about on p6l in my absence
	- have expressed opinions about some of them<br/><br/>Luke:
	- your points about Yuval's type inference is quite valid
	- I can't understand the stupid error messages<br/><br/>Larry:
	- "Something's wrong at line 42"
	- about that useful
	- also thinking about tree transformations and two-way transformations
	- seems to be one of Autrijus' pet ideas: two-way transformation
	- currently, if you use tree transformations to do macros, he wants to
	  turn that back into unmacroized whatever
	- you could write hygienic source filters that way, as it were
	- notion of unifying warnings with exceptions
	- ... where a warning is a guaranteed restartable exception printable by
	  the outermost layer by default
	- seems workable<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- I like that<br/><br/>Damian:
	- I like that<br/><br/>Luke:
	- you've just pulled continuations out into user space
	- you promised you wouldn't do that<br/><br/>Larry:
	- not overtly
	- do it by running CATCH closures up the stack and keeping the stack and
	  committing to running back when you catch something<br/><br/>Luke:
	- that's a continuation<br/><br/>Larry:
	- we could hide that with .resume or something<br/><br/>Damian:
	- it ought to be a separate kind of named block
	- maybe should be able to catch it in CATCH or something
	- probably cleaner with a WARN block<br/><br/>Larry:
	- possible that they're a type of control<br/><br/>Damian:
	- a lot of people will want to catch warnings
	- it'd be easier to capture it in a name that self-documents<br/><br/>Larry:
	- the name of the warning may be self-documenting anyway<br/><br/>Luke:
	- Piers has always wanted interactive editing
	- if an exception comes up to the top level, it can say "Something's
	  wrong; fix it and I'll keep running!"<br/><br/>Larry:
	- that's part of what I was thinking<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- did you have a good vacation, Damian?<br/><br/>Damian:
	- I wish it were a vacation
	- tore maybe half of the muscles in my back
	- had a fair bit of physiotherapy over the past couple of weeks
	- not good for sitting *or* lying down and doing stuff
	- also had a hard disk crash on my primary laptop
	- fortunately had backups, but they don't always back everything up
	  properly
	- been interesting times, especially being two weeks away from leaving for
	  EuroOSCON
	- I have been creating annoyances on p6l, as you've seen
	- very nice to have Larry back stopping some of the madness
	- very little progress to report elsewhere<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- Patrick brought up something in the implementor's meeting
	- S05 is out of date<br/><br/>Damian:
	- it's waiting on me to put in stuff about capture variables<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- are you the right person to be doing it, or should it go to someone
	  else?<br/><br/>Damian:
	- yes to both
	- I have a completed version nearly done
	- it's just slipped
	- I'll get onto it in the next day or two<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- have done more reading, but not much implementation
	- housing people for the past week or so
	- Leo and Chip and the Parrot folks have merged the branches
	- makes my life much easier
	- very happy about that!
	- can move forward on PGE again<br/><br/>Luke:
	- had a hard drive failure, like Damian
	- if you have a RAID, replace a failed hard drive
	- I didn't replace one hard drive after it failed a month and a half ago
	- then another failed
	- it didn't do much for me<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- it gave you an extra month of uptime<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- also Autrijus recommends that you make sure that your RAID controller
	  does not format *all* of your disks when you add one
	- anything new?
	- mostly hacking tree transforms?<br/><br/>Luke:
	- wrote a new module, Language::AttributeGrammar
	- implements attribute grammars
	- it was easy to write
	- does everything UUAG does (reference implementation)
	- trying to make it work nicely with PPI and Parse::RecDescent
	- presumably usable to implement something real
	- pretty much finished theory theory
	- it's in the Pugs repository
	- some lambdacamels have reviewed it positively<br/><br/>c:
	- how difficult is it to port L::AG to PIR?<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- I was thinking that too<br/><br/>Luke:
	- hm, somewhat difficult without a Perl 5 preprocessor
	- lots of lazy evaluation and nested closures
	- also thinking about use fatal a bit
	- my first fatal would be semi-fatal
	- things return undef if they fail, but if I ignore that undef things fail<br/><br/>Damian:
	- it returns undef but... ?<br/><br/>Luke:
	- if I ignore that, it causes my stuff to fail
	- behaving like an exception<br/><br/>Larry:
	- fatal in void context, basically<br/><br/>Luke:
	- a fatal undef in void context makes it fail<br/><br/>Damian:
	- that turns out not to be useful; PBP talks about that
	- fatal in p5 has a :void mode
	- it's not that useful
	- you want it to be fatal in non-boolean context<br/><br/>Luke:
	- you'd get a fail back in void context
	- you assign to a variable and that's in void context<br/><br/>Damian:
	- that's not how context works<br/><br/>Luke:
	- there's void context for the assignment expression
	- that's the semicolon
	- I should write this up<br/><br/>Damian:
	- return failures in a non-boolean context should raise the exception<br/><br/>Luke:
	- does // give that context?<br/><br/>Damian:
	- maybe it's not the only context
	- things like assignment must be not considered void
	- write it up and we'll talk about it<br/><br/>Luke:
	- also thinking about junctions
	- not coming up with any happy medium
	- I'll keep it on the list
	- have a meeting with a professor here
	- he's done significant research in attribute grammars<br/><br/>Allison:
	- grab papers if you can
	- they're very valuable
	- they're rarer than hen's teeth
	- my biggest idea has been writing a weblog about "This is why we really
	  need Parrot"
	- I've been doing a lot of reading about CLR and Mono and things like that
	- at Amazon.com, I think I managed to kidnap a former CLR developer whose
	  NDA will expire shortly
	- Autrijus desperately wants me to check in the compiler tools notes as
	  they are
	- I want to make a few changes, but I want to do that in the next few days<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- Chip was at the implementors meeting
	- he's settled, working, and his internal clock has reset
	- we talked about PDDs and how to move faster there
	- he'll start by reviewing their organization
	- then post the index of what he's writing in his head
	- then he'll sketch out each document and get some movement on them there
	- lots of discussion of necessary work to merge Leo's branch
	- the merge has happened
	- I've been getting questions about contributor agreements<br/><br/>Allison:
	- there's a new update
	- the final thing is review of the patent clause
	- especially in relation to the clause we put in the license
	- we can't take either in isolation<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- what do we need to get the review?<br/><br/>Allison:
	- Roberta says we'll have a revision in mid-to-late October<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- okay
	- that's it for me at the moment
	- who'll be on the Perl Whirl?<br/><br/>Allison:
	- Larry and I<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- I won't be here either<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- let's postpone it until next week
	- there will be no call on the 5th, but one on the 12th<br/><br/></p>
