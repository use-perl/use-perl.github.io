<p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Damian:
	- things are looking up
	- I took a break, which helps
	- first week back at work from the near year
	- lots of mail
	- I'll be in Asia and Tokyo in March
	- otherwise enjoying the holidays
	- I've been tracking Larry's updates
	- intend to send more feedback soon
	- I'll be at a Linux conference in New Zealand the week after next
	- I'll have time then<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- lots of non-Perl busy-ness here
	- will pick up on PGE again tomorrow
	- another project moved up a deadline, so that was busy
	- should free up some time tonight<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- what's the next checkpoint there?<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- actually writing a parser for Perl 6 code
	- I have the various pieces in the constellation to bring them together
	- figuring out what to do with the parse trees comes after that
	- but we can generate parse trees
	- I'll also be on #parrot again<br/><br/>Allison:
	- working on extending Punie still
	- Patrick, I mailed a question about the operator precedence parser
	- working on comma-separated expressions
	- discovered an interesting thing
	- you can set up a PGE grammar to make it easier or harder to write tree
	  transformations
	- the Perl 1 style of recursive rules makes trees harder
	- at least, harder than repetition within the rule<br/><br/>Luke:
	- what are you turning things into?<br/><br/>Allison:
	- some things need flat lists
	- some things don't, but flat lists are easier to iterate over<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- it can make a huge difference
	- it's nice to have both options with a nice syntax
	- is there a reason not to treat comma as an operator?<br/><br/>Allison:
	- not sure
	- I'll decide which way works best later
	- but I suspect repetition may be simpler<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- my plans for operator precedence allow list-associativity
	- so it may work easier<br/><br/>Larry:
	- Perl 1 had a lot of hard-wired things in its grammar
	- Perl 5 was more flexible<br/><br/>Allison:
	- definitely interesting and informative<br/><br/>Larry:
	- various bad luck
	- desperately trying to follow along on everything at once
	- not really responding
	- my day job is really busy for the next couple of weeks
	- haven't done anything on the translator
	- I'm letting that gurgle in the background<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- what's your goal for the translator?
	- 100% test suite?<br/><br/>Larry:
	- I don't know that it can ever get entirely there
	- but it's effectively there already
	- I don't know how much I'll have to warp it
	- I'm pretty confident I'm getting all of the information out
	- I don't know if I'm getting it all out in the most convenient form for
	  the translator
	- it'd be good if someone could merge it back in to the Perl 5 mainline
	  at some point
	- my impression is that Perl 5 is not mutating rapidly at this point
	- not a big rush<br/><br/>Luke:
	- what are its effects on parsing speeds?<br/><br/>Larry:
	- very little
	- only a few conditional tests if you don't want the extra information
	- a separate grammar file with extra goodies
	- just a wrapper around yyparse mostly
	- that was part of my original spec
	- do need some stuff in the tokenizer, but they're guarded by conditionals<br/><br/>Luke:
	- not much this week
	- thinking about generalizing the design of Parse::Rule into useful
	  language constructs
	- I had to pull some dirty design tricks
	- talked a bit on p6l about composable modules
	- now thinking about building an object and type system out of them
	- haven't had much time to work on it
	- but it looks promising
	- my final project for cognitive science was on tree adjoining grammars
	- they seem appropriate for our metaoperators
	- instead of building a separate operator for each metaoperator-operator combination, you
	  could set that up as an auxiliary tree in that theory
	- you can parse them top-down
	- as long as you have parameterized rules
	- I wonder if I can massage that into a grammar that actually works
	- does PGE do parameterized rules?<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- it only understands strings so far
	- subrule name, colon, space -- everything else is an argument
	- from Apocalypse 5
	- maybe never blessed into a Synopsis
	- official syntax is subrule( list )
	- PGE doesn't understand that yet<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- spent two weeks mostly not working
	- ended up writing some code, which was weird
	- heard from Chip on Monday; he's back now
	- have had some interest in Ponie pumpkining
	- is anyone blocking on anything external?<br/><br/>c:
	- what's the legal documents status?<br/><br/>Allison:
	- it's probably time for the public review<br/><br/>Luke:
	- Audrey is prodding us to come up with tagged unions
	- the theory.pod syntax isn't very nice
	- can't put my finger on why
	- I looked at OCaml's tag types
	- put a tag on a type and get a new type
	- then create unions of types and get a tagged union
	- but I've never seen them used in practice
	- I wonder how well they fit common uses<br/><br/>Larry:
	- the type becomes a value bit of the new tag
	- used as a discriminant at runtime, if not earlier?<br/><br/>Luke:
	- I think so
	- Perl has scalars where they are kind of deranged tagged unions with more
	  than one tag at once
	- but ignoring that...<br/><br/>Larry:
	- I'm agreeable to the idea that unions should be discriminated
	- the C idea of unions is a complete botch
	- there has to be some way of telling them apart
	- if they're objects, they have their own built-in identity
	- but I'm not a great type theoretician<br/><br/></p>
