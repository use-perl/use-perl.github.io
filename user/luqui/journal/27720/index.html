<p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Allison:
	- continuing to work on Punie using TGE
	- working on a grammar to convert Punie match results to PAST nodes
	- think I have a complete set of PAST nodes
	- simple core class and subclasses
	- mostly based on Pugs's PIL
	- didn't bother with Haskell-specific nodes<br/><br/>Luke:
	- PIL 1 or PIL 2?<br/><br/>Allison:
	- looked at both
	- closer to PIL 2
	- not exactly either one<br/><br/>Luke:
	- I can't figure out where PIL 2 encodes its structure
	- it works?  That's cool
	- I don't know how<br/><br/>Allison:
	- I'm not familiar enough with Haskell to mimic the implementation
	- but I don't need to mimic the implementation
	- seemed like a nice set of abstract nodes to start
	- hope to finish that Punie match trees -> PAST grammar and nodes and
	  tests today
	- might play with opcode syntax tree
	- it's going pretty fast so far
	- Roberta is on vacation for the next three weeks
	- we're still passing around license and contributor agreements for review
	  now
	- if you have suggestions for people to review it, please let me know<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- a few minor updates to S5
	- answering questions about that
	- minor changes there
	- added a Perl 5 pattern parser for PGE on Thursday
	- it understands rudimentary and basic Perl 5 patterns
	- Jerry Gay is porting over Perl 5 regex test suite
	- we can test PGE against them
	- there are 800 tests, he has to skip 290, and 155 are failing
	- I'll add a few things to handle those as time permits
	- not a high priority<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- that's a fairly late milestone<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- I'll work on it when I feel like getting a few quick tests out of the
	  way
	- ought to be handoffable to someone who expresses interest
	- I'll post a message about that
	- there's already a test suite
	- they get a lot of quick wins
	- otherwise, I'm trying to catch up with Larry's changes
	- I'm just going to have to reread the Synopses again<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- you were originally planning to work from a snapshot of the Synopses
	- did that work out?<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- we'd have to take another one to do that now <br/><br/>Jesse:
	- are you spending enough time churning that it's worthwhile
	- or are the changes useful enough to track?<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- they're useful<br/><br/>c:
	- hope to make more progress on Parrot Test::More this weekend<br/><br/>Luke:
	- scrapped theory.pod v1, working on v2
	- it has nothing to do with theories anymore
	- reading TaPL
	- coming up with a core calculus for types
	- it's the the same calculus as for execution
	- embracing executing code at compile-time
	- leveraging that into the type system
	- hope to start with something simple
	- writing a toy language right now
	- hope to implement union types and subtyping within the toy language
	- wondering how I can do inference in that
	- but it looks like I can build just about everything we need
	- way cool
	- surprised me
	- being thoroughly impressed with Haskell
	- it was up and running in 200 lines of code
	- becoming more of a convert every day<br/><br/>Allison:
	- Patrick
	- meta-information from match nodes
	- you're printing line number and source string in the dump?<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- PGE's built-in dump?
	- not using Data::Dumper?<br/><br/>Allison:
	- I'm using Data::Dumper
	- name of the rule, source string, character number on the line?
	- is there a way to get the line number of the source code for the match?
	- how can I get that string you're printing in the dump?
	- it's the raw source that this particular rule matched<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- for every match object, there are from() and to() method
	- offsets to the beginning and the end of the match
	- the match object contains a reference to the entire string it's matching
	- also then has the offsets for the portion that it matched
	- when you ask a match object for its string value, it gives you that
	  substring
	- in Parrot, if you assign it to a string register, it stringifies
	- you get the substring that it matches
	- match objects duplicate the semantics of S5
	- if you ask a match object for an integer, it gives you the integer
	  conversion of the string
	- boolean, did it match?<br/><br/>Allison:
	- lines are harder<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- because you have the from position, you can use it against the original
	  string and find out how many newlines occurred before it<br/><br/>Luke:
	- ugh<br/><br/>Allison:
	- it'd be nice to report what line of the source file had an error as I
	  write compilers<br/><br/>Luke:
	- who cares about cost when you report an error?<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- that's better than incurring the cost of counting newlines as you go
	- just count them in the string
	- I could write a method for it in the match object
	- but that's all it would do<br/><br/>Luke:
	- people will want to annotate the parse tree node with the line number
	- if it has a run-time error, it can report the line number<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- that's pretty easy to do
	- no problem
	- I'm not certain how to fit that in
	- whenever we're matching, we have to figure out where to do that<br/><br/>c:
	- need some rule with a closure that annotates the tree at newline points<br/><br/>Allison:
	- but you have to count every newline, even if it's in an embedded string
	  or heredoc<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- you don't need to annotate every node
	- just the interesting things
	- match objects tend to know a little bit about their context
	- each could easily report how many newlines were prior to it
	- and how many newlines it contains<br/><br/>Allison:
	- is this the wrong solution?
	- is it more at the level of where we read the file?
	- but I just read up to the maximum buffer size<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- me too
	- but this'll change in the future anyway
	- as long as the match objects contain the offset... provided you have the
	  source lying around somewhere<br/><br/>Allison:
	- I think you're right to delay expensive operations
	- if I store the offset
	- figure out some way to make the original source string available to the
	  error reporting routine...<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- I've come up with enough cases where it seems useful to have a target()
	  method on match objects
	- return the whole string they're matching against<br/><br/>Luke:
	- we want to support streams too<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- that's not a permanent idea for the design
	- we could throw it in right now<br/><br/>Allison:
	- it's just a question of where to put the error reporting<br/><br/></p>
