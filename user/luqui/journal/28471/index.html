Patrick:
	- customer project deadlines keep jumping and scopes keep creeping
	- the deadline is next Wednesday
	- I should be done then
	- did send Allison an e-mail about the operator precedence parser<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- you'll go into the Perl 6 parser then?<br/><br/>Patrick:
	- yes
	- maybe adding some features to PGE driven by parser demands<br/><br/>Larry:
	- also have a work deadline
	- but sneaked in a synopsis change from "till" to "ff"
	- threw some conjectural stuff in S12 to bless ^ as a shorthand for .meta<br/><br/>Luke:
	- I think it's important to keep the difference between a type and a
	  package concrete
	- I thought ^ was for types
	- I'll see what I make of your changes and *then* whine<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- P5 to P5 is still about 95%?<br/><br/>Larry:
	- haven't done anything on that in the last week<br/><br/>Luke:
	- enjoying my processor arch class
	- might dive into Parrot to apply some of my knowledge in a while
	- otherwise working on an algorithm and paper to dispatch pure
	  multimethods as fast as possible
	- can also incorporate compile-time information if it's available
	- getting those two things at once is pretty hard
	- the algorithm is still in progress
	- I can build a decision tree that dispatches to the right multi-method
	  provably with as few checks as possible
	- you can rule out some candidates based on compile-time information
	- you can use a bit of the theory that falls out of that to do type
	  inference
	- that's probably a couple of weeks away
	- it might be worth a senior thesis<br/><br/>Allison:
	- Punie almost does simple if statements
	- meeting with Chip in a bit
	- I'll work on operators next
	- it looks like Patrick's solution might fix my problem
	- have about five or six people reviewing AL 2.0
	- don't know if I'll get any comments
	- have one more week on it<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- I asked to have that list created
	- I haven't seen anything yet
	- Chip answered some of Leo's questions on Monday<br/><br/>Luke:
	- thinking about overriding stuff in classes
	- attributes that have a constant value through the lifetime of an object
	  are different beasts from attributes that can change
	- I'm searching for a way to make that distinction without imposing
	  horrible cognitive or finger blocks on people<br/><br/>Larry:
	- like our readonly versus contant distinction?
	- on ordinary variables
	- bound in a constant way
	- but not a constant
	- different iterations of this function may have a different value
	- can't optimize it away in that sense<br/><br/>Luke:
	- the fact that attributes aren't read-only inside of an object causes
	  problems with inheritance
	- that distinction may be nice to have if it works cognitively<br/><br/>c:
	- is that an implementation detail not exposable?<br/><br/>Luke:
	- more about the intent of its use rather than its actual use<br/><br/></p>
