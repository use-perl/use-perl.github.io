<p><p>...amongst the <em>"Top Turds of <a href="news:comp.lang.perl.misc">comp.lang.perl.misc</a> for 2007"</em>, the <strong>nice</strong> point being that the troll who <a href="news:1176322279.435449.184250@w1g2000hsg.googlegroups.com">popped up</a> (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.perl.misc/browse_frm/thread/d4b0cc01fbdf2066/7faed0f70858c5ba">link</a> @ <a href="http://groups.google.com/">GG</a>) in clpmisc saying so put me on the same level as Perl hackers I so greately respect and admire as: <em>JÃÂ¼rgen Exner</em>, <em>Tad McClellan</em>, <em>A. Sinan Unur</em>, <em>Uri Guttman</em> and <em>Sherm Pendley</em>; so I feel <strong>honoured</strong>. Unfortunately he also included moronzilla in the list, but then that's probably only a smart marketing operation aimed at increasing the insulting factor. BTW: I had spoken of "her" in a previous journal <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/blazar/journal/32854">entry</a>, but now that "her" appearances have become too frequent again I've killfiled "her". Thus it is by pure chance that I could notice "her" reply in the GG thread mentioned above, and this is fortunate because I eventually found a line in it that may make its way to my .sigs for once; to quote:</p>

I am number one turd, by far and by talent.
- moronzilla in clpmisc
</pre>

<p>Back to the trollish incursion, it is interesting to notice that as far as my entry in the list goes, it is, literally:</p>

<pre>
3. Michele Dondi bla...@lcm.mi.infn.it
Surely one of the rudest Italians ever!
</pre>

<p>But then I almost never publish that email address account in clear, though in a previous <a href="news:rsu1r21o78g0fjldbcmhh6t28o1cbd1fif@4ax.com">discussion</a> (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.perl.misc/browse_thread/thread/4d0b7df699fd1d1a/7abf9ba1438d1b96#7abf9ba1438d1b96">link </a> @ GG) some smart dumbass publicly "decyphered" (not much harm done since I still have an antispam filter) and then went on with usual, <em>boring, annoying, moronic</em> comments about "courtesy". So it's not that difficult to understand who the idiot is, although I doubt we could ever attach a face to him...</p>

<p>As far as the "italians" comment goes, probably the OP ignores that in Italy we have a <em>very useful <a href="http://www.ecompratelo.it/default.asp?sku=2886&page=6&where=0&idAzienda=130&Categoria=10&Settore=38">device</a></em>.</p>

<p>As far as Uri's entry goes, it's as follows:</p>

<pre>
2. Uri Guttman u...@stemsystems.com
Start using the Shift key, dumb ass. Quit hyping your pathetic
File::Slurp module so much. And cut out the whining!
</pre>

<p>Personal insults apart, I feel so strange having to admit I slightly agree with a troll for once. The all lowercase "style" is as rude to me as other forms of bad posting. However this is of course a whole another story. And yes: he uses to hype <code>File::Slurp</code> quite a lot, but of course it's anything but pathetic.</p></p>
