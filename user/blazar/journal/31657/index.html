<p><p>is both an <em>Egyptian goddess</em>, patron of cats and regarded as a cat herself (although Wikipedia has more to say on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastet">subject</a>), and a <a href="http://fph.altervista.org/prog/bastet.shtml">Tetris clone</a> that IMHO would deserve being more widely known, since the idea would benefit being further pursued and brought over to other implementations: in fact it's <em>Bastard Tetris</em> in short: it just gives you the worst piece for each situation.</p>

<p>Now, any connection? Evidence suggests most probably not, but what could prevent one from possibly inventing one?!?</p></p>

Playing too much bastet may screw up how you play regular tetris, since the strategy for each is slightly different.<br><br>I had no idea about the Egyptian goddess, though.

<p>Rather than discuouraging me, this suggests me it could be a tempting experiment. Point is, although I regard myself as a rather good regular tetris player, I still haven't found <em>any</em> strategy for the damned beast that bastet is...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>

<blockquote> <div><i>I had no idea about the Egyptian goddess, though.</i></div> </blockquote>

<p>So did I up until saturday. My therapy was to begin late in the evening and I had virtually nothing to do for the rest of the day, thus I asked for a permission, which they conceded me, and took the chance to visit Turin and it's rather famous <a href="http://www.museoegizio.it/" title="museoegizio.it">Egyptian Museum</a museoegizio.it>. Bastet was not so heavily represented as Sekhmet, the other feline goddess, and the one regarded as the fiercer of the two, at least from some point on, but I did notice a statue, and immediately recognized the name.</p>

<p>The lesson to be learned, though, is what I read in Wikipedia, specifically that Bast/Bastet was regarded as lioness herself originally, and only later on as a domestic cat, <em>occasionally depicted holding a lionness mask, which hinted at suppressed ferocity</em>.</p>
