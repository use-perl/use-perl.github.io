<p><p>This is the second mention of a PerlMonks <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=607182">entry</a> from last week I wanted to do...</p>

<p>Putting it briefly, I expected that a command like the one in the subject would <code>open()</code> a file "in memory" with the appropriate layer. Simply, it's not so: if you specify a layer, then the reference will be stringified and interpreted as a file name. Not too much of a problem: you can still use an explicit <code>binmode()</code> on the handle. Only, it's by all means a confusing behaviour, and I don't see how anyone could contradict me. Point is, the docs <em>never</em> say "if the third argument is a scalar reference, then it is opened as in memory file." Actually the feature is only described by two examples, both referring to <code>'>'</code> mode. Indeed other ones work too, but <em>not</em> if layers are specified. All in all I would say that the documentation could be clearer. But more importantly, although I am aware that Perl (5) deviates often enough from orthogonality, I don't see much usefulness in it doing so in this case and I would prefer it to be consistent by behaving as (I) expected.</p>

<p>Incidentally, Anno <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=607185">mentioned</a> another situation in which it would be nice to have a scalar reference implicitly refer to a file "in memory", namely in connection with the magical <code>ARGV</code> filehandle, that is if you put one such reference in <code>@ARGV</code>. Indeed if such a beast did exist than that handle would be even more magic!</p>

<p>Now that I think of it, it would also be nice if <code>@ARGV</code> supported typeglob references to be interpreted as filehandles too, for even more magic. Not something for which I feel a compelling need, but not bad to have, I guess... (I can imagine a <em>few</em> situations in which it would be useful.) Of course this has not much to do anymore with the subject of this post...</p></p>
