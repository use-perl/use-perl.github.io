<p><p><a href="news:comp.lang.perl.misc">Our</a> resident troll! She has been occasionally doing so, lately. Fortunately on a very sparse basis. Noticeable is that this particular <a href="news:prGdnT6wFfiJ_pDbnZ2dnUVZ_q6vnZ2d@giganews.com">intervention</a> was not too trollish. A few of the recent ones were, though. Nice to know: I would have been upset, knowing such a shocking true like that the contrary had happened...</p></p>

<h2>Will there be a FF plugin for this, BTW?</h2>

<p>Indeed, I have this problem whenever I include <code>news:</code> urls in web forums posts. In fact on my system they work seamlessly out of the box. But not everybody have a newsreader installed nowadays. And even if they have, not always is the system so smart as to call it on such urls.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when I'm in a particularly non-lazy mood, I do include links to the corresponding <a href="http://groups.google.com/" title="google.com">Google Groups</a google.com> entries. But this can get tiresome at times...</p>

<p>Come to think of it, Google Groups' <a href="http://groups.google.com/advanced_search?" title="google.com">advanced search</a google.com> supports searches by msg id. (Which is the tool I use to find those links.) Thus I wonder if there's a FF plugin that would call that when clicking on a <code>news:</code> url and there's no newsreader defined for the system. Actually I don't need it myself and I'm not motivated enough to search it...</p>

<h2>Awe-inspiring longevity</h2>

What mind-boggles me is how long she's been trolling the newsgroup. I remember that she was already going strongly when I began to lurk around (circa 1999?), so it'll soon be a full decade of trollship... Ye gods...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-P<br><br>When one thinks about it, one could almost say that she already transcended the mere status of troll to become something more; she pretty much became a kind of Moby Dick of the comp.lang.perl.misc sea... (which, I guess, has the corollary to put uri in captain Ahab's role<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) )

<h2>Trolls of a higher breed...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/blazar/">blazar</a> on 2007-04-01T23:50:07</h3>
Just the same day, <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups/search?q=xah+lee" title="google.com">another one</a google.com> made an <a href="news:1175180497.362830.285710@y80g2000hsf.googlegroups.com" title="googlegroups.com">appearance</a googlegroups.com>.  This one is a troll whose crackpottery probably outweights the trollishness, although they are roughly comparable, and is definitely a crosscultural one, for his attempts are always crossposted. Knowing that Perl is his most hated religion, I somehow expected him to be considered less of a troll and a crackpot in other communities. Evidence as given in some other messages of that thread, which -I admit- I read notwithstandig the fact that I have him killfiled, gives me some relief by letting me know that this does not appear to be the case. That for sure makes for a <em>high profile</em> troll: it would have considerably lowered his reputation, not to be considered equally trollish in all of the environments he likes to harass...

Ah, yes, Xah Le... I agree that the jury is still out as to which tribe -- crackpots or trolls -- he's part of, but the fact that he never partake in the flamethreads triggered by his posts kind of hint to the latter.<br><br>But we better stop listing the Who's Who of the c.l.p.m. freaks, lest people will begin to think it's akin to the Mosley Cantina -- a wretched hive of scum and villainy.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<p>Fair enough, but judging from what I see in other communities I'm tempted to say that even in the realm of freaks Perl does better! OTOH with those two I think we've fundamentally exhausted the list of long term recurring PITAs in clpmisc.</p>

<p>*g* True. Other languages may get mere freaks, but Perl attracts Kwalitee Kooks.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) </p>
