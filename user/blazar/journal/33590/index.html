<p><p>Funny, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_%28predictive_text%29">T9</a> for my mobile, in Italian, gives first "tv" (short and common for <strong>television</strong>) and then "tu" (<strong>you</strong>). I am aware of the intrinsic difficulties with predicting text and I cannot speak for other T9 implementations/releases nor similar systems. But this particular instance seems... well... as I wrote: funny!</p>

<p>Even more funnily, before terminating this entry, I answered an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_message_service">sms</a> and while composing I noticed that 3-4-6 gives in order: "fin" (beginning of several different and common words including "fine", i.e. "the end", but also "thin" or "purpose": same spelling, different words at all, BTW), <strong>"dio"</strong> (god) and <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego">"ego"</a></strong>: one may even read a hidden message in this. Others would find the issue controversial and blasphemous though.</p></p>

<p>I knew that! In fact I've been knowing it for huh... let me see... nearly seven years!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-) Fortunately, I don't use Word... but then I'm slightly envious... who is to offer a ready made <a href="http://www.tug.org/" title="tug.org">LaTeX</a tug.org> equivalent?</p>

<p>Well for a sort of kiddie pride about being able to do everything that M$ Word can do. Including popular "culture" histerias!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>But seriously, on a second thought I'm beginning to suspect -reading your first reply- that you may have been thinking of me as <em>"seeing a pattern in static"</em>, as in "conspiracy" or some such, perhaps due to my use of the adjective "hidden". If that is the case, then that is <em>not</em> the case: yes I agree that we, and specifically I, see those patterns. But I didn't mean to imply anything more sound than one's own meditation out of serendipitous coincidencies. To put it straight: I don't believe in horoscopes, numerology nor any superstition that I can think of. But coincidences happen, all the time, and those can possibly trigger mechanisms raising even <em>sound</em> meditations. My hint was aimed at that, and a sort of provocation. Of course the 9/11 bs is none of that, if you ask me...</p>

<p>Ah, OK. Yes, I had indeed gotten that impression from your post; however after your comment I figured you were not actually falling into that trap.</p>
