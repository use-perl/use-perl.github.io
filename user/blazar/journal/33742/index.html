<div class="span8">
<p><p>So yesterday I updated to the latest release of <a href="http://www.activestate.com/">AS</a>'s <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/">ActivePerl</a> on my windoze pc. To do so, I first uninstalled the previous one. I noticed, in the control panel, that it was described as <em>"used rarely":</em>  <strong>Funny!</strong> (Actually, my windoze copy is in Italian, so I don't know if that's <em>literally</em> what would have got out in the English version.)</p></p>

<h2>I think it is...</h2>

I have no idea what "algorithm" they use to determine that since I use it all the time.

<p>Indeed now that I see most of the installed software that I use is marked as <em>"used rarely"</em>, even though I actually use it quite frequently: the count is probably taken from "official" launchers like the menu entries or icons on the desktop (which I don't have), in fact e.g. Adobe Reader itself which is used quite often has that stigma too - but generally on downloaded or generated documents. Indeed I didn't expect anything particularly different: it was just a funny remark, because probably perl.exe is one of the single executable most often run on my Windows installation.</p>

You know, that makes me think of something...<br><br>Windows XP is supposed to 'optimize' application performance based on how often you use the application, clustering the application files closely together on the faster accessed (? not clear on this) tracks of the disk (or something).<br><br>I wonder if it uses the same criteria for determining which applications are frequently used as you see in the uninstall application.  If so, it's seriously flawed.  I also have often seen applications that I use frequently labeled as rarely used.  I _think_ I've seen applications I never or very rarely use as labeled used often, but I'm less clear on this.

You know, I just HATE to be self-promotional, but since you spelled Windoze with a "z" (hopefully implying you hate Windows, and prefer Perl on Unix)...<br><br>Have you tried out Strawberry Perl yet? It's exactly like Perl on Unix, built-in gcc compiler, and a CPAN client that actually works properly, so you don't need PPM modules.<br><br>If you have and didn't like it, any feedback?<br><br>

<p><blockquote> <div><i>You know, I just HATE to be self-promotional, but since you spelled Windoze with a "z" (hopefully implying you hate Windows, and prefer Perl on Unix)...</i></div> </blockquote>

<p>Well, a component of hate and a component of humour: actually I think I'm more a *NIX-kinda-mind, and at a certain point I was much more on Linux than on Windows although for various reasons I never left the latter completely... but since about one year, that is since about when I discovered the disease I've turned mostly into a Windows-kinda-guy, albeit a somewhat unsatisfied one. Actually I've wanted for months to write a journal entry about this subject. The fact itself that I've wanted to do so for <em>months</em>, and did not, should give you a clue... (But if you want, watch for it, it'll come first or later...)</p> <p><blockquote> <div><i>Have you tried out Strawberry Perl yet?

<p>Yeah, I heard about <a href="http://vanillaperl.com/" title="vanillaperl.com">Vanilla</a vanillaperl.com> and <a href="http://win32.perl.org/wiki/index.php?title=Strawberry_Perl" title="perl.org">Strawberry</a perl.org> Perl. (At some point I heard about <a href="http://win32.perl.org/wiki/index.php?title=Chocolate_Perl" title="perl.org">Chocolate</a perl.org> too.) But for one thing it is still deemed experimental and OTOH I must say I'm mostly fine with AS's ActivePerl.</p> <p><blockquote> <div><i>If you have and didn't like it, any feedback?</i></div> </blockquote>

<p>No, but I will certainly provide some if I do. Actually I'm now more concerned with having working tools soon even if unsatisfactory ones for some reason, than with experimenting. So I'm just fine with a web broser, a newsreader, Putty, <strong>a working Perl installation</strong> and a bunch of "minor" things...</p>
