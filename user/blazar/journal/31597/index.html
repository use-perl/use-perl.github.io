<p><p>Well, actually I completely ignore how new or old it may be, but I ignored its whole existence altogether, so... Whatever, it's <code>study()</code>. Is "to discover" the right verb for such a thing? Who knows... It was brought to my attention by a clpmisc post (<URL:news:1163429694.397139@proxy.dienste.wien.at>) but it was a <code>perldoc perlfunc</code> away. I didn't know it simply because I can't remember having seen it mentioned anywhere in discussion or example before today. And discussions and examples are very important means for me to learn...</p>

<p>BTW, I selected "User Journal" as a "Journal Topic", because I can't see any that is just "Perl": would there have been a more appropriate one? Is the topic important anyway, or can one safely just stick with "User Journal"?</p></p>

<p>That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s only rarely useful and very nearly never a clear win. You may as well never think about it, and it won&#8217;t make a difference.</p>

<p>If you want to see another relic burried in <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlfunc.html" title="perl.org">perlfunc</a perl.org> that&#8217;s even less useful, check out <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/reset.html" title="perl.org">reset</a perl.org>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure selecting a topic even has any effect at all. Maybe it does on Slashdot (which runs the same software) but not here. I think everyone just leaves that at default.</p>

<p>Indeed I can't remember having used it, but I <em>had</em> seen it before. Actually I have a hard time judging whether it's more or less useful than <code>study()</code>, although I'd rate it close to it. AIUI there's a difference though: the former has a semantic (side-)effect; the latter is only supposed to be (possibly) useful for speed optimization, but won't change what one's script will do in any way.</p>

<p>Also, I saw your links: up until now I used </p><blockquote> <div><tt>&lt;URL:http://example.com/&gt;</tt></div> </blockquote> as shown below the composition window: are there other shortcuts, or do I have just to put <blockquote> <div><tt>&lt;a&gt;</tt></div> </blockquote> tags manually for anything more complex than that?

<blockquote> <div><p>the former has a semantic (side-)effect</p></div> </blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s sort of tautologic, of course; its entire point is the side effect.</p>

<blockquote> <div><p>the latter is only supposed to be (possibly) useful for speed optimization</p></div> </blockquote>

<p>I know. However, it takes time itself and rarely usefully speeds up a match, so in the general case, it will cause a speed hit (albeit usually a small one). The circumstances in which it can provide a measurable speed-up are so specific that in practice, the function is useless. And that&#8217;s why it doesn&#8217;t come up.</p>

<blockquote> <div><p>do I have just to put <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags manually for anything more complex than that?</p></div> </blockquote>

<p>Yes &#8211; Slashcode offers no special markup other than <code>&lt;ecode&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;URL:...&gt;</code> thing. But <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Aristotle/journal/24811" title="perl.org">I use Markdown to write HTML in textareas</a perl.org> anyway, so I don&#8217;t care much.</p>
