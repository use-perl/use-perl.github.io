<p><p>I'm selfish. So I have been said. Actually I think I am. <em>But not in the form and for the reasons that have been addressed to support the claim.</em> Nor did I really understood them. Moreover, it is well known that when the person who will tell you so is one in the regards of whom you prove a particularly intense feeling... you won't accept it with such a light heart. After all I'm a very common person. A common, selfish person... and perhaps I grew too involved. Too involved with respect to the limits I had thought to have chosen, limits within the reach of which I had illusorily assumed I could safely stay, out of rational control... as a form of self defense... because self defense <em>does</em> sense in my case... rational control: bullshit! <strong>Perhaps I simply fell in love.</strong> And if so, then I don't know if I'm more excited about it or scared, and that's the scary part. Why does it have to be so difficult?</p></p>

<p><div class="quote">It's a roller coaster ride.</div>  <p>Yep, up and down... but hitting the ground too. With the risk of getting hurt: in fact the next entry, which also is really about this subject, is called "Scars". And it refers to a scar in my heart. Just one day and it's a scar... but... since when I discovered to have cancer I thought that "that" would have been a part of me definitely off. Died out completely. Like... well Judo. Except that Judo is not an intrinsic need of human beings... it just grew in me, along the <em>way</em> I followed, growing in it. OTOH I suspect that even the most abominable of men must have loved someone at some point. And... to put it shortly, it's nice to have that part of me <em>resurrected.</em> I feel so... <em>alive,</em>  including pain and all!</p>
