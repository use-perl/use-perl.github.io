<p><p>There's a very popular satyrical tv news in Italy, which I occasionally watch. Tonight I did: amongst some not particularly interesting reports mostly about gossip and similar stuff, there was one which was astonishing instead. Both hilarious and naturally arousing of one's indignation: to put it briefly, at a medical centre they are doing treatments with a machinery called <em>"oberon"</em> which basically consists of a set of earphones coupled with a portable pc and is supposed to be a diagnostic means able to replace a CT, a PET, a NMR, and even blood tests, but also a therapeutic one. This "device" has been reported to be a known fraud in the USA and in many other countries, they say. Not hard to believe. I may include many other details about what they said to the girl who went there with a hidden camera and I guarantee you that it's even worse than the above! Only one thing, to explain the subject: the man who manouvered the apparatus (who is not a physician, but a manager of the place!) <em>"diagnosed" the girl with polystyrene in the bones.</em> He went on to explain that that's the material flesh containers are made of, at supermarkets, and on the long run it accumulates in the bones! He proceeded to press some keys on the portable pc to perform <em>"inversion of  polystyrene!"</em> with the aim of removing it, of course.</p>

<p>As a person with a serious health problem, I really hope those people get kicked in the ass. If that was not the case with my health, anyway, I would still wholeheartedly hope that those people get kicked in the ass.</p></p>
