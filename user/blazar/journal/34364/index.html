<p><p>She's gone</p>

<p>But it wasn't the KKK that took her away</p>

<p>Just a misunderstanding</p>

<p>A long series of misunderstandings</p>

<p>Perhaps deliberate ones?</p>

<p>Apparent inability to grab the concept of the expression <strong>"I love you"</strong>

<p>I've never ever said that, was it not the case</p>

<p>In fact to only three women did I say it</p>

<p>But it was not enough</p>

<p>And now, silence...</p>

<br>

<p>Current soundtrack:</p>

<blockquote>
Hello darkness, my old friend,<br>
Ive come to talk with you again,<br>
Because a vision softly creeping,<br>
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,<br>
And the vision that was planted in my brain<br>
Still remains<br>
Within the sound of silence.<br>
<br>
In restless dreams I walked alone<br>
Narrow streets of cobblestone,<br>
neath the halo of a street lamp,<br>
I turned my collar to the cold and damp<br>
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of<br>
A neon light<br>
That split the night<br>
And touched the sound of silence.<br>
<br>
And in the naked light I saw<br>
Ten thousand people, maybe more.<br>
People talking without speaking,<br>
People hearing without listening,<br>
People writing songs that voices never share<br>
And no one deared<br>
Disturb the sound of silence.<br>
<br>
Fools said I, you do not know<br>
Silence like a cancer grows.<br>
Hear my words that I might teach you,<br>
Take my arms that I might reach you.<br>
But my words like silent raindrops fell,<br>
And echoed<br>
In the wells of silence<br>
<br>
And the people bowed and prayed<br>
To the neon God they made.<br>
And the sign flashed out its warning,<br>
In the words that it was forming.<br>
And the signs said, the words of the prophets<br>
Are written on the subway walls<br>
And tenement halls.<br>
And whisperd in the sounds of silence.
