<p><p>When I first become a <code>use Perl;</code> user and started writing into this journal, I had so much enthusiasm that I probably used to write even too much... as one can clearly see, it didn't really last much. OTOH as I privately wrote to a friend of mine, <em>"I don't have anything to do, but I can hardly find the time to do (or not to do?) it!"</em> That's incredible! How could I cope with that if I had to work too?!? (Which <em>hopefully</em> I will have to, first or later!)</p>

<p>Actually I didn't want to be too annoying with my considerations and recordings about my disease, and I'm not doing that now. I would have liked to have some <em>Perl</em> story to tell... and indeed there has been something that occurred to me in the meanwhile, that may have constituted a good subject, but I was too lazy. Just the bad kind of lazy. Now I'm writing this. Will I be back up'n'running with my musings from now on? Who knows?</p></p>
