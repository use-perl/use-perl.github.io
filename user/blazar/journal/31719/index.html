<p><p>Last cycle's novelty was hyperacusis, then gone and now back to some extent. This cycle's one is some breathing difficulty. Most probably a side effect of the growth factor for staminal cells. (Two underskin injections a day, BTW.) In fact it's described in the accompanying flier. Actually not just as serious as, say, asthma: I know because my dad suffers from that. And it's on a sparse basis: when it comes, it's just like, you know, it's somewhat like breathing is difficult... as I said, nothing terrible, but ehm, well... annoying! Actually I <em>didn't</em> know, you have to <em>feel</em> something like that to know how it's like.</p>

<p>Last night I had to sneeze, and I'm "renowned" for my noisy, vigorous sneezes, but even though I <em>did</em> actually do it, it came out weak and "innatural" like, so to say, my lungs refused to contract, or to do so with their normal strenght. I don't know if that's the correct medical explanation, and I doubt so, but that's how it feels. It was quite strange.</p></p>
