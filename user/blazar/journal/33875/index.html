<p><p>One can't imagine how frustrating it is that I cannot seem to find the time and resources to keep up with the journal and write in it anything that I consider to be serious and worthwile in my life... so I'll cope by occasionally writing random observations and minor issues...</p>

<p><strong>I'm a liar:</strong> amongst my .sig's I've had for some time (a year, two?) the following:</p>

<blockquote>
Fuckin hell how could we resist that?<br>
- Johnny Rotten, Live in Chemsford Prison.
</blockquote>

<p>Well, it popped up the other day, and for one thing I corrected it to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelmsford">Chelmsford Prison</a>. Then I checked my archives and found out that it was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filthy_Lucre_Live">Filthy Lucre Live</a>. And knowing what the latter is I'm not sure I want to keep this .sig, but... WTF! In any event and just to be sure, I'm a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Mind_the_Bollocks%2C_Here%27s_the_Sex_Pistols">liar</a> which is coincidence that applies nicely here. But I still prefer the concept as expressed in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennywise_%28band%29">Pennywise</a>'s  <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennywise_%28album%29">No Reason Why</a> (why we lie to ourselves and anyone else!)</em> - even if I feel that applies to a former stage of my life. OTOH we're what our past built. Hence, as I said I must be a liar, and just to be even more sure, <em>nobody's innocent.</em></p></p>

<h2>You are not a journalist</h2>

The biggest realisation I had to come to with this journal is that I don't HAVE to write in it regularly. I'm not a journalist, I can write when I like.<br><br>So depending on how much open source stuff I'm doing, I write with a frequency anywhere between once a day or once a month.<br>

<p>I write whenever I get the whim and whenever I think I would somehow benefit from putting something here.  Maybe I'd benefit from the reaction of people who might see what I write.  Maybe I'd benefit from getting my thoughts in order, as I did yesterday when I started out to ask a question.  Maybe I'd just benefit from putting something here so I can find it later.</p>

<p>If I don't benefit, I don't write.</p>
