<p><p>As the doctor put it, "I'm at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadir">nadir</a>": I've reached the minimum in my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte">neutrophils </a> count, the next few days it should increase. It's also an absolute minimum, since the previous ones had been around IIRC 0.29 x 10^3 per cube millimeter, now it's exactly 0, so that <em>literally</em> it couldn't be lower.</p></p>

<p>In fact I could swear on what's dearest to me that I've been just as careful as one can be, and so were my parents, who even seem that little bit paranoid at times, in this respect. <em>But</em> at a certain point I began feeling so cold... I tested my temperature and it turned out I had a temperature. I also had an annoying mucositis. The following day, which is yesterday, I had a check at the hospital. Since my platelets were severly low as well, they decided to check me in again, so here I am: back in the hospital again. The symptoms are all much weaker now, and all in all I would say I feel well. Only, I would have preferred not seeing this place till the next cycle, you know...</p>
