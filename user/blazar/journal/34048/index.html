<p><p>I've just been given this book: a nice surprise because I did know that the artist, one of XX century's most influential, had been a judoka, but I didn't know that Judo actually had <em>such an important role</em> in his life and in his art (in this respect very interesting are the introductory parts) and that he had even written a book. It seems that only recently has it been reprinted in France and that it was formerly unpublished in Italy.</p>

<p>As far as the technic content goes, it has to do with Judo's six classic katas: I've not really read this part yet, but at first sight in its <em>essentiality</em> it seems well done. Maybe it won't be the ultimate technical handbook, but IMHO it will be absolutely interesting to all Judo practicing people who want to look at the study of katas from the -<em>appropriate</em>- perspective of an artist, who seemingly gained a sound understanding of them.</p>

<p>Plus: the border of the pages is in authentic <a href="http://www.international-klein-blue.com/">IKB</a>!</p>

<h2>I love Judo</h2>

I played at the national level for a bit and had one international meet. I loved Judo. It was really fun and hard work at the same time.
