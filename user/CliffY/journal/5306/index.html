<p>Well with the new position comes what I thought would be an added bonus, a co-op! I was told he knew perl and was very helpful, apparently I was still hung over when I heard that and believed it! This kid is the most useless piece I've seen in a long time. I'm about ready to do a hard 20 and be done with him.
<br>His name is something like Chip or Tad, you get the idea, who names their kids these stupid names. Whatever happened to good names 
like George, Guenther or Barney or Roger. People give their kids these stupid names like Brian,  Brandon, Starsky, Renaldo, and Boyce and you know your gonna be dealing with someone who's been riding the short bus.
<br>Back to the problem at hand. This perl guru who I've been "blessed" with asks wonderful insightful questions like:<br/><br/>
"What's the difference between eq and == ?"<br/><br/>"I was wondering if anyone had a list of CHMOD permission codes."<br/><br/>"What is the main difference between $ARGV and @ARGV besides one is a string and the other is an array?"<br/><br/>This genius has 3 Perl books on his desk and we have perldoc installed! If I ever meet his parents I'm sure I'll understand!
