<p>I must admit, I thought Perl 5 was "good enough" and didn't really want to spend the time to figure out perl 6.<BR><BR><br/><br/>Then I saw <A HREF="http://matt.diephouse.com/presentations/Perl6Essentials.pdf">Matt Diephouse's Presentation on Perl 6</A><BR><BR><br/><br/>All the pure OO guys who want intutive OO syntax, run time type information, templating, strict type checking and structured exception handling?  It's in there.<BR><BR><br/><br/>All the perl purists who want nothing to do with  types, exception handling or required OO syntax?  ... well, it's in there.<BR><BR><br/><br/>Want a "Switch" Statement?  You can have something better: given/when.<BR><BR><br/><br/>Want typed paramteres?  It's in there.  Don't want typed paramteres?  It's in there.<BR><BR><br/><br/>Simply put, Perl 6 provides the features of C++ or Java that OO people "need", but doesn't <I>require</I> them.<BR><BR><br/><br/>Of course, some lady with a resturant has been saying that since the perl 6 project started, but it took more than 5 minutes for me to "get it".<BR><BR><br/><br/>IMHO, the biggest problem with perl 6 is marketing. Instead of calling it "P6/P" I think it should be called "P6EE."  And the parrot runtime should have a fancy name like "The e-CLR" (The Extensible Common Language Runtime).  With a few more bells and whistles, we might even be able to the get the pointy-haired-boss crowd ...
<BR><BR>
Sadly, Unlike Dr. Maher, that forces me to ask the question "Hey, are we really sure we <I>want</I> the pointed haired boss crowd?"<BR><BR><br/><br/>That one is going to take some thinking.

<h2>reinventing perl</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/inkdroid/">inkdroid</a> on 2003-11-20T15:46:46</h3>
I think you are right about the marketing thing. Simon has an interesting <a href="http://blog.simon-cozens.org/bryar.cgi/id_6579" title="simon-cozens.org">mini-essay</a simon-cozens.org> in his blog about reinventing Perl, which your blog entry reminded me of. Perl6 is going to be great, but we need to be making Perl fit into more interesting niches...AND PUBLICIZING IT. <a href="http://www.bioperl.org/" title="bioperl.org">bioperl</a bioperl.org> is a great example, ORA's <a href="http://perl.oreilly.com/news/success_stories.html" title="oreilly.com">success stories</a oreilly.com> is another. Little things like Tim Bray's <a href="http://tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Colophon" title="tbray.org">ongoing</a tbray.org> blog help as well. Language syntax aside, if Perl5 can run on top of Parrot with advertised speed gains, and other languages can too (Python, etc), this could be a huge thing.



<h2>With tongue in cheek</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/VSarkiss/">VSarkiss</a> on 2003-11-20T17:03:22</h3>
<p>I once <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=242242" title="perlmonks.org">commented
about the same thing</a perlmonks.org> on Perl Monks, and got some good suggestions.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=242453" title="perlmonks.org">reply from
particle</a perlmonks.org> in that thread seems prophetic now.
If he'd spelled it "ponie" I would've been shocked.</p>
