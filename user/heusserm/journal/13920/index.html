<div class="span8">
<p>I recently did a ten-minute talk on Test-First of OO modules.  This got me to thinking 'hey, I should put this on my blog' ... which got me to thinking 'hey, I should have a blog.  If it were RSS enabled, Steve Hoek could use it to test his RSS Reader ...' :-)<br/><br/>So, here it is:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Let's say we're going to create a module called 'SomeObject'.  <br/><br/>We knoew SomeObject will be a container, and it will take three optional paramaters on creation: The values of the entries at A, B, and C.<br/><br/>SomeObject will have two methods, 'Get' and 'Set'<br/><br/>So, we design the following tests:<br/><br/>1) Does SomeObject.pm compile?
2) Does SomeObject have new and get methods?
3) If I new, does it create a SomeObject object? 
4,5,6) With the Object I created above, does it have the correct values for A, B, C?
7) Is the entry for D "Undefined?"<br/><br/>The tests are below:<br/><br/>#---------BEGIN CODE---------#
#use lib wherever SomeObject is. ('./')?
use Test::More;
BEGIN { plan tests => 7 };
use_ok('SomeObject');<br/><br/>can_ok('SomeObject', qw(new get) );<br/><br/>my $t = SomeObject->new(1,2,3);
isa_ok($t, 'SomeObject');<br/><br/>my $a = $t->get('A');
ok($a, 1, "Get 1st Parameter");<br/><br/>my $b = $t->get('B');
ok($b, 2, "Get 2nd Parameter");<br/><br/>my $c = $t->get('C');
ok($c, 3, "Get 3rd Parameter");<br/><br/>my $d = $t->get('D');
my $blnOk = 0;
if (!defined($d)) { $blnOk=1;}
ok($blnOk==1, "Making sure no extra variables are created");
# --- If we really wanted to be slick, I'd
#     iterate from D to ZZZ or so, but I don't
# The for would have a bln we'd check, so we'd
# only have one variable, not 26*26*26.
# 
#---------END CODE---------#<br/><br/><br/><br/>
When you run the test file intially, only the use should pass, because you haven't even _coded_ the other methods.<br/><br/>Then, you code and test.  Eventually, the test results look like this:<br/><br/>1..7
ok 1 - use PH::SomeObject;
ok 2 - PH::SomeObject->can(...)
ok 3 - The object isa PH::SomeObject
ok 4 - Get 1st Parameter
ok 5 - Get 2nd Parameter
ok 6 - Get 3rd Parameter
ok 7 - Making sure no extra variables are created<br/><br/>Pretty nifty eh?<br/><br/>Not really, but it's a good start.</p>

It'd be written even better as:<blockquote><div> <tt>my $d = $t-&gt;get('D');<br>is( $d, 'expected_value', "get(D)");</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>Use of is(), like() and isa_ok() is a very good thing where possible.

<h2>Question</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/phillup/">phillup</a> on 2003-08-05T18:02:59</h3>
I'm *extremely* new to testing and this post was very informative for me. Thanks.<br> <br>But...<br> <br>What is test # 7 about?<br> <br>What if 'E' exists?<br> <br>What if the object is inherited, couldn't it have a 'D'? (hmm... that wouldn't happen during testing tho... right?)<br> <br>From a philosophical view, it would seem to me that tests should cover the requirements... and I didn't see anything in the requirement to drive test 7.<br> <br>It also seems that if you wanted to check that there were not extra variables created, you would need to enumerate all the variables that were created... instead of picking a random variable and testing for it.<br>

<blockquote><div> <tt>ok($a==1, "Testing 1st Parameter");</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>is better written as</p><blockquote><div> <tt>is( $a, 1, "Testing 1st Parameter");</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>for better diagnostics on failure.  Any time you're writing </p><blockquote><div> <tt>ok( $a == 1 )</tt> </div></blockquote> you probably want <blockquote><div> <tt>is( $a, 1 );</tt> </div></blockquote> unless your name is Nick Clark, in which case you reall, really meant '==' so its <code>cmp_ok($a, '==', 1 )</code> or Damian Conway, in which case there's probably a really good reason you used ok() instead of is().

<p>Even better would be:</p><blockquote><div> <tt>is( $a, 1, 'getting A' );</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>Mentioning that you're "testing" something in a test name is redundant and redundant, strike that out.  Then there's the matter of properly describing what you're testing.  You're not testing the first parameter, there's no order that I can see here, you're testing that you can get A.

</p><p>Finally, assuming you don't need $a, which you don't...</p><blockquote><div> <tt>is( $t-&gt;get('A'), 1, 'getting A');</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>why clutter up your code with unnecessary temp variables?

</p><p>The last test, as mentioned before, is better written as:</p><blockquote><div> <tt>ok( !defined $t-&gt;get('D'), 'no extra params created' )</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>to remove all that life support around it.  But what if $t-&gt;get('D') did return something?  How would we know what it was?  Same way we do with everything else, use is().</p><blockquote><div> <tt>is( $t-&gt;get('D'), undef, 'no extra params created' )</tt> </div></blockquote>
