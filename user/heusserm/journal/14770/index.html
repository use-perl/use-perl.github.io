<p>If you check out the various forums and magazines for software developers today, you'll find a lot of whining:  Software Developers are mistreated, underpaid, over-worked, easily laid off, h1b this, overpaid CEO that, blah, blah blah.<br/><br/>I have to admit, I've spent a great deal of time as a whiner.  The truth is, lots of coders are under-paid and over-worked.  They have been loyal, or dedicated, and not been rewarded.  They worked thousands of hours of overtime for that $250.00 bonus and did the math.  They are peeved.<br/><br/>Now, I ask:  Why do you think that is?<br/><br/>In my opinion, it's pretty simple.  Not only do software developers lack negotiation skills, they often don't even RESPECT those skills!  <br/><br/>How many times have you heard a coder say out loud "Sales is something I never want to do."<br/><br/>Is it any wonder that, when that coder gets laid off, he has problems getting a job?  After all, the most common way to find a job is to sell youself ...<br/><br/>(Yes, the further you get in your career, the more reputation and free gifts sell yourself for you.  I'm mostly talking about entry-level and all-proprietary shops here.)<br/><br/>Last week in class, we covered "Critical Success Factors".  It's an info systems policy class, and the idea is simple:  Identify the things you MUST do right, and everything else will fall into place.  On the other hand, if you do them wrong, you've set yourself up to fail.<br/><br/>Then you make sure you nail your critical success factors.<br/><br/>It occurred to me that, for most smart coder-types who want to become independent consultants, the Critical Success Factors (CSF) are sales, marketing, and relationship-building.  Working independently, the coders are going to be able to do just about any work for hire.  The challenge is getting the work in the first place.<br/><br/>That's the critical success factor.  What surprises me is that there are so few folks talking about that - we'd rather spend our time talking about kwikis and FIT and whateverelse new toy is our now. hmm.<br/><br/>Vaguely Related: http://software.ericsink.com/Marketing_for_Geeks.html </p>

Well, yeah.  Those things are a lot friendlier than people, 9 times out of 10.
