<p><I>Our contractor's notion of what a ``schedule'' is drives me insane. It seems like when he says, ``it will be done by wednesday afternoon,'' what he means is, ``the guy who will be doing the actual work told me it will be done by wednesday afternoon.'' But the thing is, he knows that the guys who work for him are total flakes, and sometimes just don't show up at all. Yet his answers suggest that this takes him by surprise every single time. So it has proven utterly impossible to schedule anything based on his dates. He seems to think that answers like ``well the guy didn't show up'' should satisfy me, when I have to call up the person I've scheduled and tell them, ``oh, nevermind.'' </I><BR><BR><br/><br/>From <A HREF="http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2001/02.html">Some other Guys Blog</A> (February 27th, actually)<BR><BR><br/><br/>This is pretty much the exact story of my bathroom modelling, only on a larger scale ...<BR><BR><br/><br/>(No, it wasn't "re" modelled, it was modelled.  I put in a bathroom where there was no electrical or pipes in the first place ...)<BR></p>
