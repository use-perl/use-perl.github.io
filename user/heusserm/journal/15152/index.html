<p>... It to sell someone else a way to make money quick.<br/><br/>When what you are selling is in fact your own system, that's called a ponzi scheme or a pyramid scam and it's illegal.<br/><br/>However, "one level deep" pyramid scams are legal and very common.  Probably the most common is the Real Estate Plan - "Make millions in real estate with no money down."<br/><br/>Of course, the people who are making the millions are the ones selling the plan.  Otherwise, instead of TV info-mercials, they would be out buying real estate, wouldn't you think?<br/><br/>Another common one-level deep pyramid scam is the 2nd-or-3rd-Rate College-MBA scam.  I'm sure you've heard the Ads on the Radio: "Earn your MBA Part-Time in about 6 months without leaving the comfort of your living room ..." these ads all but guarentee employment and a big salary once you get the MBA.<br/><br/>Of course, they also exist for BS/BA and AA programs - very often in Computer Stuff like networking or, my goodness, computer science.<br/><br/>Of course, there is a large group of people who are ... less than swift.  For some reason or other, these people lack the skills to get and keep a high-paying job.  What they desparately want is a "sure thing" - a degree or certificate to earn to "guarentee" them a high salary.<br/><br/>So, they go to Joe Schmoe College and earn an MBA. And, of course, they still lack interviewing skills - and - more importantly - analysis skills.  So they can't really make use of the MBA.  (It's from Joe Schmoe anyway, which isn't exactly Ivy League, so it's easy for employers to blow off.)<br/><br/>One big problem is that this increases the pool of available, incompetant MBA's - which decreases the percieved value of the MBA itself.<br/><br/>Simply put, this is essentially why I oppose Perl Certification.  Eventually, training companies would spring up that will allow incompetants to pass the test - and hiring managers will begin to say "Perl?  Nah, I think we should use Java.  We hired some Perl certified programmers for the flim-boozle project and look what a mess they made ..."<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
