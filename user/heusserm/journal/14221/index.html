Essentially, there are two kinds of jobs:<BR>
<BR>
The first is innovative, creative, or catalytic.  Artists, Engineers, Programmers, Architects, and Entreprenuers fall into this category.<BR>
<BR>
The second is simply "doing what I was told."  The cashier at McDonalds, the Assistant Janitor, and the security guard fall into this category.<BR>
<BR>
This semester, I'm taking CS 643 - Information Systems Policy.  The book is <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130340731//heusseronlead-20/002-0515097-5868803">ISM In Practice: Sixth Edition</A>.  A typical case study might read like this:<BR>
<BR>
Company X's ERP implementation was 1 year late, and vastly over budget.  However, in the short time since the ERP system started, the company has allready realized cost savings from tigher integration - both horizontal and vertical.<BR>
<BR>
<I>What the heck does that <B>mean?</B></I><BR>
<BR>
From what I can tell, the book is just a little bit of Drucker, a little bit of Deming, a little bit of DeMarco and Lister, and a whole lot of the popular press management magazines (E-Week or InformationWeek or Whatever), all pre-digested and reguritated.  (This was the conclusion I came to, then I read the reviews, which pretty much said the same thing.)<BR>
<BR>
And this is CS 643 - it's the third course in the series of IS courses, intended for MS in CIS candidates who want to SPECIALIZE in ISMN.<BR>
<BR>
I'm downright SCARED of what the MBA candidates who are specializing in "IT Management" are reading.<BR>
<BR>
Here's the thing:  From what I can tell, the book (and too many MBA programs) are trying to take a creative, thinking job (IT Management) and turn it into a management-by-rote job.<BR>
<BR>
Creative people have real problems with rote jobs.  Some of them get into process improvement, but, most of the time, they just quiety move on.<BR>
<BR>
The result is that, all too often, the people who will "make it" in IT Management are the ones who don't like to think too much.<BR>
<BR>
Thank goodness the company I work at isn't like that, but it does explain a lot about the over-abundance of Pointy-Haired Bossess ...<BR>
<BR>
PostScript:  On re-read, the stuff about seems to identify a problem and not a solution.  My proposed solution?  Let the students read Drucker, and Deming, and Goldratt for THEMSELVES, and come to thier own conclusions.  It's harder, but it forces them to think - and thinking and making tough decisions is what makes great management, well ... great.<br/><br/>

There are two kinds of job; those that you shower before work, and those that you shower after.
<br> <br>
Words of wisdom from my Uncle. I've had both kinds<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

As far as I can tell, that's pretty much the case in <em>any</em> management.

Remember the Dilbert Principle -- that people will be promoted to the position they can do the least amount of damage at.</p>
