<p>Ok, so here's the function:<BR>
<BR>
sub RemoveSpaces<BR>
{<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   my $s = shift; <BR>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     $s=~s/\s//g;<BR>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     return $s;<BR>
}<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here's the thing:  This couldn't possibly break.<BR><BR>
Does this mean that I don't need to test it, or at least I don't need to automate the testing of it?<BR>
<BR>
One of the big elementes of XP and "well-factored" code is small sub-routines.  Subs that are small enough that you can understand everything that is going on - or subs small enough to only need one comment, and that comment is the name of the sub.<BR><BR>
In CS 611 (Software Engineering), we talked about collapsable code a lot.  Basically, if you only have one return per function and don't have any knotted loops, it's possible to get complete code coverage of an entire function.  If your next-level function does the same, you can abstract the lower-level function out and get code coverage of the higher function.<BR><BR>
XP then provides two benefits:<BR><BR>
1) Smaller systems have less complexity, and thus less bugs.  XP emphasises keeping code small and simple.<BR><BR>
2) Functions in XP stay small.  There are less things that can break - examining a small portion of a chess board is much easier than trying to examine the entire board and all the possibilities.  This leaves less things that can possible break.<BR><BR>
And having less things that can possibly break is a very good thing.

And yet, it's invalid syntax.  It <i>is</i> broken.

Test early, test often, test always.</p>

<p>Though a test would catch that it doesn't compile (as Randal points out), it would also allow you to change it later to something like this:</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>sub RemoveSpaces<br>{<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $s = shift;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $s =~ tr/ \b\r\n\f//d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return $s;<br>}</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>It's okay if you don't want to do that, but I'd prefer it to the regex.</p>

Does that work in a Unicode world? The regex version does at least (one hopes) deal with all kinds of whitespace once and for all; the <code>tr///</code> version is necessarily fragile because the programmer has to enumerate all possible kinds of white space.

<p>You're right, it probably fails with Unicode.  Thankfully, I don't have a story card for handling Unicode.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Does anyone actually <em>like</em> Unicode?
