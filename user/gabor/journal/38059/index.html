<p>I have already tried to initiate several projects that need the support of TPF, some of them around getting more money for the activities of TPF such as the grants.
<p>
Every time I had to privately chat with one or more TPF officers.
<p>
Why is there no public mailing list of TPF with all of its officers subscribed where outsiders like me could start discussing possible 
projects (e.g. fund drive) and where everyone could see the issues that need to be resolved 
for such project to take off?
<p>
Why not provide a forum to people who would want to get involved some of the work you are doing?
<p>
Oh I think I have dÃÂ©jÃÂ  vu I just don't have time to dig out my earlier posts about this.
<p>
Anyway, further ranting <a href="http://szabgab.com/blog/2008/12/1228898258.html">here</a>
<p>
And the hard part with this is that I know at least some of the people in TPF personally and I think very highly of their work. At least the part I see <b>outside of TPF</b>. So why do I feel the urge to criticize them or TPF?</p>

<h2>Mailing list exists, but blog more visible</h2>

<p>We do have a public mailing list tpf-discuss@perl.org. But it hasn't been used in years. We found that the only traffic it got was us posting announcements, and one or two people responding to the announcements, so we changed that over to our public blog news.perlfoundation.org. A blog has the advantage of reaching more people than whatever few subscribe to a mailing list, and allowing other blog/news sites to link to our announcements. My apologies if I didn't explain this adequately when you asked me about it on IRC a few days ago.</p>

For your announcements the blog is indeed better.
<p>
I am looking for a place - and I think that should be a public mailing list - where I can subscribe and initiate a discussion that is highly related to TPF.
</p><p>
e.g. I'd like to discuss with you a fund drive for TPF.</p>

<b>From Allison</b> by e-mail.
<p>
Did once, but trying to post a comment on use.perl now gives me "You are
not allowed to use this resource." even though I'm logged in. Here's
what I would have responded:
</p><p>
"Please feel free to use tpf-discuss, but the modern way to have a
conversation like this is to post on your blog, send a link to people
you want to be sure see it, and talk back and forth in comments and
other blog posts. Which is exactly what you've done here. Far more
people will read this than would read the mailing list."
</p><p>
The irony is, I can't post my reply to the blog right now because of a
technical failure.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) But the principle holds. (And, happy to have you
post this reply in the use.perl comment thread so all can read.)
