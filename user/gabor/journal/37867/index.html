<p>Yesterday I release the first version of
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Padre-Plugin-CommandLine/">Padre::Plugin::CommandLine</a>.
<p>
This is the first step in my attempts to provide a vi-ish command line for Padre users.</p>

<p>This is the feature which, at the end of the day, kills me with other editors:  my fingers are so used to vim that I even have trouble with Notepad.  I haven't been able to compile Padre on my MacBook (there was some strange Wx error -- never got as far as Padre), so I'm not able to test this right now.  Wasn't overly bothered by Wx, so never filed a bug report<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Talk to Schwern, he is now the local MacOS wx expert, or talk to me on #padre
<p>
I can give you the moral support</p>

<p>Not to be a downer, but the command line alone is not what attracts me to vi. The reason I love it is the very reason most people loathe it, namely normal mode, with its separation of motion vs action (particularly in vim, where motion is a more refined concept allowing for things like text objects) and its facilities for repetition in both simple and complex ways at all scales.</p><p>The smarts in the editor interest me only quite peripherally; it&#8217;s the compositionality of its keyboard interface where the brilliance is. There is almost no automation there &#8211; the interface is extremely manual and explicit. But it&#8217;s like playing an instrument, or heck, like walking: you internalise the gestures to the point where, even though you&#8217;re doing it all manually, you&#8217;re no longer thinking about the individual motions. You perform them subconsciously while thinking in higher level goals. The computer acts as an enabling extension of the user rather than as a magic spell.</p><p>(That&#8217;s kind of the opposite of the goal of an IDE, which is why I am having to consciously try not to dismiss Padre out of hand even as I expect not to care much for it. But if it becomes all that Alias in particular is hoping for, it might become something I&#8217;ll use for Perl editing alongside vim.)</p>

<p>er, me too.  I've taken to playing with vimmate (<a href="http://vimmate.rubyforge.org/" title="rubyforge.org">http://vimmate.rubyforge.org/</a rubyforge.org>) of late and despite its warts, it's almost okay for the simple things I ask of it now.  However, as will be painfully obvious to anyone who trys to use vimmate, it ain't there yet.  Also, its goals aren't as lofty.</p><p>I like where Padre is going, and as soon as Padre incorporates vi(m) in a fashion similar to vimmate, I think I'll start using padre full time.</p>

well, I also missed the vi key-bindings for navigation and the insert vs navigation vs command mode since I started to write and use Padre.
<p>
I stress missed.
</p><p>
As I've just added an experimental vi-mode that has the 3 modes and some really little set of the keys.
</p><p>
Now I suffer as I try to type vi-ish things and most of them don't yet work<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
