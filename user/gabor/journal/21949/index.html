<p>I have just received a CV claiming <br>
<p><b>6 years PERL experience</b></p>
I am not sure what to do with it.
Does this mean the person does not know how to spell Perl, he does not care or he is actualy very considerate with the average CV reading person who is actually looking for PERL experience and would be confused by the word Perl?
<p>I personally try NOT to correct others if they are using PERL but how should I undersand that someone spells it like PERL ?</p>
<p>Another interviewee just claimed that he is <b>one of the best Perl programmers in Israel</b>. That would be fine with me. But then he never heard about the Israeli Perl Mongers. What does that mean ? (Besides the fact that we as Perl Mongers still have a lot of work to do ?)

<i>But then he never heard about the Israeli Perl Mongers.</i>

<p>That's probably why he thinks he's the best<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) He thinks he's the only one<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p><p>I've seen that happen quite often, believe me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) Even where I work<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) There's a guy in the same floor I'm in who's thought to be a real great Perl programmer just because he does the ocasional script for a boss, but he doesn't even know that there are conferences on Perl, he doesn't use strict nor warnings and does some magnificent things I wouldn't wish to my worst enemy-script<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p><p>Example follows:

</p><p>/\d+\d+\d+\d+\d+\d+/ # WTF??

</p><p>I don't claim to be an excellent programmer (thought I am, of course, cough, cough O:-) ), but it sometimes annoys me to see guys like this one getting all the credit... especially not using strict!!!

</p><p>Oh well...</p>

What you need to realise is that the vast majority of the Perl (or PERL!) programmers in the world have no contact at all with the Perl community. Most programming languages don't have a community like ours so a new programmer won't necessary go looking for it. Most Perl books don't emphasise the community aspect of Perl, many of the most popular ones don't even mention it.<br> <br>I'm not at all surprised by the number of Perl programmers who happily exist outside of the community. I _am_ surprised by the number of people who are surprised by this.<br> <br>Now, if you have any ideas on how we can reach out and involve those programmers, then there are a large number of people who would love to hear them.

<p>I would still put a lot more stock in a programmer who is "plugged in" to the community.  Anyone who's got six years of experience with Perl or PERL (hey<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I got six years!) could benefit extremely from contact with the community.  We all know there are good books and bad books out there.  Most programmers do their learning from those books.  Those who are in contact with the community have additional sense about how to evaluate those books, as well as the accelerated reinforcement of learning that contact with the community brings.</p>

<p>As to the original question, my first instinct would be to junk a resume that said PERL, but I see the point that the applicant might just be doing that to get past ignorant HR desk jockeys.  In the end the only real way to know is to evaluate the guy.</p>

<p>But then, <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/petdance/" title="perl.org">Andy Lester</a perl.org> says you should <a href="http://www.asktheheadhunter.com/" title="asktheheadhunter.com">Ask the Headhunter</a asktheheadhunter.com> and have the applicant do the job to get hired.  If they can do the job, they're qualified, right?</p>

Which means that most of those books were written by people that were not "plugged in" as well.  Which means that we probably have more of "blind leading the blind", because they won't be talking about cool things like the mailing lists and Perlmonks and the CPAN.
<p>
And if that's the only place where a person got his "PERL" knowledge, then he's also not a very effective Perl programmer.  Hence, "PERL" is in fact a good indicator that the person is not a good Perl programmer.  He's not even reading the "perlfaq" that ships with Perl!</p>

<p>For the French translation of the Camel book (3rd ed.), we conviced O'Reilly France to insert a page long presentation of the French Perl Mongers (it was just Paris, back then). That was easy to do, since the three translators and the reviewer were from Paris.pm...</p>
<p>The text appeared in chapter one, which most people overlook(*) anyway, so I don't know if anybody noticed...</p>
<p> <small>(*) OK, I <i>do</i> read chapters 1. But then I often overlook most of the other chapters...</small> </p>

<h2>Book Shelf</h2>

I just looked at my book shelf, here is what I saw that capitalized it:<br> <br>- PERL Black Book<br>- DeBUGGING PERL<br>- THE PERL CD BOOKSHELF<br>- PERL 5 UNLEACHED<br>- PERL Annotated Archives<br>- PERL 5 HOW-TO<br>- PERL IN A NUTSHELL<br> <br>Granted, most capitalized the entire title, but most of the older books capitalized just PERL.<br> <br>A random look inside the books, however, show all refering to the language as Perl.

Capitalization of the title on the cover or home page is a design decision, not an editorial decision. Even if it says "PERL Black Book", that's not the correct rendering of the title, any more than you'd say "GONE with the WIND" just because the cover artist happened to like the way the words fit together with that capitalization.<br> <br>Looking inside the books, as you did, is the way to go, so your report actually indicates that none of them used "PERL".
