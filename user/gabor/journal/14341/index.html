<div class="span8">
<p>Nearly every time I mention I use Perl I get 
these empty looks:
<p>
<b>I have never heard of that.</b>
<p>
Once in a while I ask back: 
<p>
<b>So what programming languages have you heard about ?</b> 
<p>
and either it turns out the person cannot name any language or I get Java and C and 
sometimes even VB if I happen to talk to a VB programmer.
<p>
Some people will immediately say
<br>
<b>That must be some old language !</b>
<br>
and look at me sligthly forgiving. I am not really sure what do they mean 
by that. Does that mean being old is considered to be bad ? For a language ?
Then I guess C should be in even worse situation.<br>
<p>

<b>So I wonder how popular Perl really is and how many people use Perl ?</b>
<br>
I did some research but I'd be glad to see more estimates.
<p>
According to <a href=http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm>TIOBE</a> Perl is the 4th most popular programming language
(after Java, C and C++).
<p>
According to <a href=http://www.activestate.com/Corporate/>ActiveState</a> there are 
approximately four million users of Perl, Python, Tcl,PHP and XSLT. I have no idea how to get a cloeser estimate on the Perl users from this.
<p>
According to this discussion on the
<a href=http://perlmonks.thepen.com/282606.html>Perl Monks</a>
there are about 25.000 registered Monks but of course there are lots of people who have never heard about the Perl Monks.
<p>
According to < a href=http://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/ask_tim/2003/salesexpect_0603.html>Time O'Reilly</a>
the Programming Perl book sold over 600,000 copies. If we assume 
the extreme case that all 3 editions were sold 
to exactly the same people we get 200,000 different people who 
bought it. I'd guesstimate more the 3-400,000 range.
<p>

More pointers are welcome !

<h2>my back-of-the-envelope calculation</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2003-08-27T14:31:15</h3>
In the heyday of the dot-com boom (and pre-Java days), I used to tout the estimate (based on book sales, trainings we did, and on how many programmers didn't buy the books) that there were between 250K and 1 million people who had written a line of Perl code in the previous month.
<p>
However, times have changed. {grin}</p>

<ul><li><i>In the heyday of the dot-com boom (and pre-Java days)...</i></li></ul>  <br> <p>Are you referring to two different periods, say 1995 and 1999?  Java was well established during the heyday of the dot-com boom.<br> </p><p>Or, are you saying that Java has become much more entrenched since the dot-com boom?  I guess I could see that.  With the Industry contraction, shops are choosing one language for development a lot of times and Java often wins the competitions.  Of course, recently Java is feeling the heat of competition from<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.net.<br> </p><p>
