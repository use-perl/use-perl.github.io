<p>New week, new release.
<p>
I would like to thank everyone who took the time, tried Padre and wrote comments in response to my requests on <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=08/10/28/1658213">use.perl.org</a>
or on the <a href="http://perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2008-October/009856.html">Israel.pm</a> mailing list.
<p>
While it will give us plenty of work I'd be happy to get more people trying Padre and letting us know what are the things that still hurt.
It would be even better if more people started to hack on Padre or start writing Plugins.
<p>
Hey there are now <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Padre%3A%3APlugin&mode=all">5 Padre plugins</a> on CPAN!.
<p>
We have started to implement some of the requests and worked on some other things as well. As usual the <a href="http://svn.perlide.org/padre/trunk/Changes">changes are here</a>.
<p>
The main features are:
<ul>
<li>Cleanups in how the dialogs look like.
<li>Close All but Current Document menu option.
<li>Add auto indentation.
<li>Before saving, check if file has changed on disk.
<li>Reload file menu option
<li>Ctrl-T is the default new file hot-key just as in Firefox.
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Allow the execution of PASM files using parrot
<li>Allow execution of Perl 6 code using Rakudo
<li>Allow Padre to partially run on Parrot
<li>Padre::Plugin::Parrot - an example on how to write plug-in for Padre that runs on Parrot.
</ul>
The last four will only work if you have Parrot compiled on your system and configured the require environment variables. See
<A href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Padre/lib/Padre.pm">Padre.pm</a> for details.
<p>
Padre can be installed using the standard CPAN.pm shell but if that does not work there are some instructions on the <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/wiki/Download">download page</a>
<p>
I have not yet packaged a binary version of Padre 0.15 for Linux but for Windows there is a beta version of Portable Strawberry Perl including
Padre 0.14. You can download it and then upgrade Padre by typing cpan install Padre.
<p>
Enjoy and provide feedback!
</p>

<p>just added ticket at <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/ticket/91" title="perlide.org">http://padre.perlide.org/ticket/91</a perlide.org> with details.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/gabor/">gabor</a> on 2008-11-03T14:05:34</h3>
It is because Padre comes only with Build.PL and old version of CPAN.pm try to be helpful by creating a Makefile.PL but they don't know what to put in.
<p>
The solution is to upgrade CPAN.pm, or better yet, Bundle::CPAN</p>

<h2>New File Shortcut Is What?</h2>

<p>"Ctrl-T is the default new file hot-key just as in Firefox."</p><p>Firefox does not have the concept of new file. You can open a new tab with Ctrl-T, an existing file with Ctrl-O or a new window with Ctrl-N (most Windows application use Ctrl-N for new file/window/whatever).</p><p>Using Ctrl-T is going to confuse me to no end.</p>

<p>Most of this mucking around with hotkeys is just a prelude to being able to configure your own, which is of course FAR superior to anything we can pick for you.</p>

<p>Augh, <em>no!</em> The defaults have to be perfectly good because the crushing majority of people never customise the software they use. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make it a preference&#8221; leads straight to UI Disaster Central.</p>
