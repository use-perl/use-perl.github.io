<p>Ah, finally I got my brand new US visa.
<p>
When about a month ago finally we decided with my wife to visit my sister in NY I found out to my dispair that my US visa has expired. Oups. Never mind, I ran off to my browser filled in tons of questionaries and asked for an interview. One of the questions was my date of travel where I wrote 17th of June as we planned to leave that day.
<p>
Not surprisingly the earliest date I was offered for the interview was 19th June.
<p>
I tried to ask for an earlier date but I was told
it is only in case of <b>life or death</b>.<br>
No thanks. Than I'd rather wait.
<p>
Anyway, having the appointement at 12:30 exactly (Please, be on time - I was told) I thought it will go smoothly.
<p>
Well, I got to the US consulate in Jerusalem and then was pointed to a queue of about 30 ppl.
<br>
You could see on their faces they have been there for some time already standing in the semi shade - semi sunshine.
<br>
It took us about an hour to get through to the information window, just in order to get a number to the next queue....
<p>
After another hour of waiting I got in the third queue. I am glad I brought a good book <a href=http://vamos.hp.hu/HogyVolt.htm>Hogy volt of MiklÃÂ³s VÃÂ¡mos</a> with me.
<p>
Anyway, I got the visa and I could even go back to the consulate and pick it up on the next day.
<p>
The only small problem we had left was that we did not have a flight ticket...
<p>
Anyway, we solved that too, so tomorrow we are flying to New York and then probably visiting Washington DC and Philadelhia as well. We might even go to Boston.
<p>
What my wife definietly wants to avoid is 
<a href=http://www.yapcchicago.org/>Chicago</a>
<br>
I wonder why ?
