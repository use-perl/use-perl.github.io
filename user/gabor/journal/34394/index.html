I found it earlier today on <a href="http://programming.reddit.com/" title="reddit.com">http://programming.reddit.com/</a reddit.com>.<br><br>I too must say I can only wonder, after it has been in the works for 6 years. 6 years! (Is it even beta yet?) Some IT projects don't even have a life expectancy that long.

<p>Some IT projects have budgets.</p>

<h2>Not an entirely fair criticism</h2>

I don't think this is a fair criticism.  I wouldn't expect any profit-constrained business to track any alpha software -- which Parrot clearly is at this point.  Parrot's current version is 0.4.15 and the developers have a clear idea of what constitutes, say, 0.5.0 and 1.0.  Once we get to 1.0, then it becomes plausible to ask the developers to distinguish between 'stable' versions -- which businesses would presumably track -- and 'development' versions.</p>

<p>Yeah, but isn&#8217;t that the point? Parrot&#8217;s still alpha &#8211; fair enough &#8211;, but it&#8217;s been in the works for six years already. When is it going to get to 1.0?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s a good argument &#8211; much depends on how much work has really been invested in those six years, and how quickly the project will settle once the groundwork has been laid down. But it&#8217;s a valid question.</p>

<p>Btw, it wasn&#8217;t Gabor who wrote that article, he merely linked it.</p>

<p>When there are enough patches to add sufficient features and test and documentation and remove sufficient bugs to get to 1.0.</p>

<p>The Cost is fixed, so the only two knobs to adjust are Time and Scope.</p>

<h2>Lack of corporate backers</h2>

<p>
So there's no point to a virtual machine unless it's the property of (or, at the very least, heavily subsidized by) a large corporation?</p>

<p>I think rather his (her?) point was that successful technologies attract corporate backing.</p>

<p>That's not true, but it's a different point.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2007-09-10T07:49:54</h3>
I thought his point was more that having a corporate with dollars pushing development to go faster helps make development go faster.<br>
