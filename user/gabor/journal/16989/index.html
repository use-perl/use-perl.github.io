<h1>Certification or referral system ?</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>Since the recent <a href=http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=04/01/10/0055227>discussion about certification</a> I was wondering if instead of a semi-central certification system we would be better off with some referral system. I am sure there are a number of such systems out there and I am also sure they have their own problems.<p>
I have been using <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/>LinkedIn</a> for a few weeks now and while it does not provide all the features I think we need it could be a good starting point.
<p>
I though of some system where I could say things like "This person took the Fundamentals of Perl course in my company" without saying if s/he was good or not. Or I could say "I don't know this Randal guy personally but I have seen some of his code and some of his articles and I think he is good". Or your boss will be able to write an endorsment for you like "XYZ worked in my team for 3 years. He is very motivated, knows a lot about Widget development and while he can work on his own he is also a good team player."
<p>
We could also add an interface that will generate a weighted score of referrals for each person. 
So the applicant could write this score on her resume instead of a Certificate.
<p>
If there are not too many negative things about such a system then we can either setup one of our own or use an existing one like the above mentioned

Hm, I like this idea.  When people ask me if I'm interested in doing a small contract job, it's usually from references that they get my name, not my resume or my web site.  What do you feel was missing from LinkedIn?  I should probably go look at the site now...
