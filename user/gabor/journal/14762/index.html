<h1>CPAN mirrors powered by SUN ?</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>Currently on the main page of CPAN there is a logo of CPAN that includes a logo of Sun. I guess this is because the hardware of the main CPAN site or that of PAUSE was donated by Sun. Right ?
<p>
Because of the way the mirroring works this means that on every one of the 236 public mirror sites and on the unknown number of private mirror site you can see the same attribution.
<p>
IMHO it would be much more appropriate if this logo could be replaced by a split logo (one for CPAN and one for Sun) and the mirror owners would have the right (and the tool) to maintain a different logo and maybe a link to themself instead of the "Powered by Sun" logo.
<p>
See the <a href=http://www.php.net/>PHP mirrors</a></p>

<h2>How about...</h2>

I think I understand what you are trying to accomplish, but I personally don't agree with diminishing the value of Sun's donation.<br> <br>Instead of going "zero sum" how about "making the pie bigger"?<br> <br>By this I mean: add a spot for a "Powered Locally By" logo.<br> <br>Just an idea...



<h2>Sun gave 3</h2>

<p>enterprise servers and a disk array to us. Not to mention that the main FUNET server is a 12-way enterprise class server. search.cpan and the main mirror are 'powered by Sun' and we fully appreciate their generous contribution much like we appreciate FUNETs contribution and also carry their logo on the front page.</p>

<p>In a cult of ego it's rather hypocritical to get upset over a tiny logo which we put only on the front page of CPAN as a tip of the hat to Alan Burlison and the guys at Sun whose generosity are very much appreciated and which everyone who uses CPAN benefits from daily.</p>

I did not say to remove the Sun logo from the machine(s) that are supplied by Sun. IMHO search.cpan.org should also carry the logo of those who sponsor the hw and bandwidth in a more prominent place. I think most people (including me) are not aware how generous Sun is in contributing the server(s). Details - like those you started to give above - would be appreciated.
<p>
What I said is to replace the Sun logo on machines that are sponsored by others and to give credit to  their generosity. If you feel that the Sun logo should be even on those machines then at least the suggestion of <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=15609&amp;cid=2430" title="perl.org">phillup</a perl.org>  could be used to <b>add</b> the logo of the local sponsor. They should get the credit too.</p>

search.cpan does have <a href="http://search.cpan.org/site.html" title="cpan.org">such a page for sponsors</a cpan.org>. Also, a mirror being what it is, I won't say it's impossible to individualise content for logos for each mirror site, but I suspect it would be a lot more work than it would really merit. We have <a href="http://mirror.cpan.org/" title="cpan.org">mirror.cpan.org</a cpan.org> and thank them fairly frequently which should be enough.
