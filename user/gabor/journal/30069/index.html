<p>If I could ask for an improvement I would really like to see Expect.pm (and thus Expect::Simple) working on Win32.
<p>
I am not sure what is the problem, but if it can compile on Cygwin then I guess one could extract the required part from Cygwin and include that in the Expect.pm distribution.
<p>
As I can see there was some solution as there seem to be a binary version of <a href=http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/dist/Expect>Expect for ActivePerl 5.6</a>
<p>
So can anyone make that work?</p>

<p>I wrote at least one working Expect.pm program on Cygwin, several months ago.  I don't recall having to do anything to get it to work.  I was pleasantly surprised that it did work.</p>

Yes, I meant that I would like to use Expect.pm on native Win32 without the full Cygwin stack.

<p>Ah, I get it now.  I'm betting that it relies on just way too much of the handling in the Cygwin DLL.  What finally got Expect.pm working on Cygwin was, I believe, not changes to Expect.pm (and the modules it relies on), but improvements to the Cygwin DLL itself.  I suppose someone could extract the relevant portions of the Cygwin DLL, but I imagine you might wind up with most of the DLL.</p>

<p>But that's an uneducated opinion.  It might in fact be very trivial.</p>
