<p>The biggest problem of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI">PPI</a> is that its slow. This causes any code depending on it such at <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl-Critic/">Perl::Critic</a> or the syntax highlighter of <a href="http://padre.perlide.org">Padre</a> to be slow.

In the last couple of weeks <a href="http://www.semuel.co.il/">Semuel Fomberg</a> has been writing a replacement Tokenizer in C++.

<h2>How much faster?</h2>

<p>Through simple profiling, I got 30% in some simple hacking.</p>

I don't know how much faster the C++ implementation can be but currently it is reasonable to use PPI in Padre only for files that are less than 300 lines long.

<p>I recently wrote a custom XML syntax highlighter for Wx::STC. I found that if I tried to highlight more than a couple of hundred lines at a time it would be unacceptably slow. And even fewer lines if I waned to edit (and not just view) the document.
</p><p>
I got around this by only styling lines that were visible. I used <tt>GetEndStyled()</tt> to tell me where I should begin styling, instead of starting at pos=0 every time. I stored state in <tt>SetLineState()</tt> which coupled with <tt>GetStyleAt()</tt> gave me enough information to know whether I might need to backtrack a little when restyling. I would only style 200 chars for each <tt>EVT_STC_STYLENEEDED()</tt>. And I shortcut the highlighing if either (a) I went off the screen, or (b) my styling matched the existing style.

</p><p>
With all these optimisations I ended up with some nippy syntax highlighting. I haven't checked how Padre is using PPI for custom syntax highlighting. And for all I know, you are already using similar optimisations. But if you're not, I think you will need to because he STYLE_NEEDED event is raised on every key press, so you're going to want the event handler to return prety quickly. Even with a C++ tokeniser I don't think you'll be able to highlight entire documents quickly enough without impacting user experience.

Best of luck,<br>
