<p>I wish I was at a conference someone else organized. 
<p>
I enjoyed myself so much more in Braga than now on <a href=http://www.osdc.org.il/>OSDC::Israel</a>. I am too nerveous to make sure everything 
works that I can hardly listen to talks.
<p>
In any case I listened to Larry - again.<p>
Heard Audrey for the first time and for a short period I thought I actually understand Haskell.<br>
A bit.
<p>
I listened to Joel Barel talking about decisions they made when starting to build an Open Source based company. It was not geeky, but very interesting to me.
<p>
I also missed 3 other talks I really wanted to hear.
<p>
The quality of the refreshements was far from what we got last year in YAPC::Israel, lunch was OK, though the queue was a bit long. Dinner was very nice but only 1/3 of the people stayed for the dinner and even they went home just after one short hour.
<br>
Yeah, its a problem when most people live in just 1-2 hours drive away from the conference. They want to be home early in the evening.
