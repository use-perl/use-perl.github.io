<p>I keep reading and hearing about YAPCs that many of the attendees are first time visitors to a Perl conference.
<p>
I heared this on last years YAPC::EU and I read about this from the report chromatic wrote about YAPC::NA.
<p>
This is great. This means Perl conferences attract many new people.
<p>
This also means that many people don't come to a second Perl conference.
<br>
(I don't know about YAPC::NA but AFAIK YAPC::EU did not grow in the past few years, if anything it was shrinking in size.)
<p>
So why do so many people stop coming to Perl conferences right after they have been to one?
<p>
As most business owners can tell you, the best are the returning customers.
<p>
Why are the Perl conferences not turning newcommers into returning visitors?

<i>So why do so many people stop coming to Perl conferences right after they have been to one?</i>

<p>Because most of those newcomers are locals! They have a YAPC near their place of residence and they take the chance to go there!

</p><p>The following year the conference is in some other place/country, and they don't bother going, or don't have to means to.

</p><p>It's not like they didn't like the conference, it's just that the year after they don't get the same possibilities they got the year before.</p>

That's definately the case for me - YAPC::EU will be in the UK and therefore assuming I can find the money and register in time I'll be going.<br><br>I won't be travelling abroad to the next one tho'.<br>
