<p>I woke up this morning to the news that Metro has finally caved in to the demands of
<a href="http://www.house.gov/barr/">Congressman</a> <a href="http://www.actupdc.org/bobbarr/">Bob</a> <a href="http://www.zpub.com/un/wanted-barr.html">Barr</a> and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A5836-2002Mar10.html">renamed</a> the National Airport station on the Metro to Ronald Reagan National Airport.  Barr claims his main concern is that people are confused when the full name isn't in the station name, but for some reason he hasn't threatened to withhold funds to force Metro to rename Stadium/Armory to Robert Fitzgerald Kennedy Stadium/DC Armory. (I wonder how people avoid confusion in Boston, where the airport station is called simply Airport.)<br/><br/>(Of course, Metro may rename Stadium/Armory anyway in its continuing quest to make sure the station names overflow any available space for writing them -- the most recent example being the renaming of U Street/Cardozo to, believe it or not, <a href="http://www.wmata.com/metrorail/Stations/ustreet_st.htm">U Street/African-American Civil War Memorial/Cardozo</a>.)<br/><br/>Barr's campaign to honor the opponent of big government by having the federal government impose his name over the objections of local residents will continue.  The <a href="http://www.reaganlegacy.org/main.htm">Ronald Reagan Legacy Project</a> wants to name something after the man in each state and county in the country (as well as put him on the $10 bill -- Alexander Hamilton is too uncool).  They also want to suspend the rules that provide for a 25-year period after someone's death before building a <a href="http://www.citypaper.com/2000-09-27/urban.html">memorial</a> -- apparently they've got to build quickly before the judgment of history makes it clear that they're making a mistake.<br/><br/>And you furriners shouldn't assume you're safe.  No doubt Barr will suggest adding new countries to the Axis of Evil if we don't have a Ronald Reagan Buckingham Palace, a Great Pyramid of Ronald Reagan/Khufu, new Ronald Reagan statues to replace Afghanistan's destroyed Buddhas, and so on.<br/><br/>Just imagine what the RRLP will want to do once the guy's actually dead.</p>

I'm actually quite surprised that RRLP hasn't gotten Congress to put in a one-time override of the USPS rules prohibiting the honoring of a living person on a postage stamp.
<p>
At least we have to wait until 2010 until the US Mint can start issuing the Ronald Regan Memorial Quarter series -- one for each movie he made.  Can't wait for the Bedtime for Bonzo quarter.  'Specially if it comes before the "Planet of the Apes Charleton Heston memorial quarter"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
