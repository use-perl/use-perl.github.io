<p><p>My latest bank statement included an ad that starts like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Do you know where your time goes? For instance, in an average lifetime we spend...</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>6 months just sitting at traffic lights</i></li>
<li><i>8 months opening junk mail</i></li>
<li><i>12 months looking for lost possessions</i></li>
<li><i>5 years just waiting in line</i></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming an average lifespan of 72 years, that means that during an average day (including childhood and old age), a person would have to spend

<ul>
<li>10 minutes sitting at traffic lights</li>
<li>13 minutes opening junk mail</li>
<li>20 minutes looking for lost possessions</li>
<li>100 minutes waiting in line</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, the first might be believable, depending on where the person lives, but the second and third are clearly too high, and the last is completely insane. Do ad copywriters not have calculators, or do they lead lives very different from ours?</p></p>

<i>100 minutes waiting in line</i>

<p>If I were you, I would consider writing a letter to bank stating I would choose another one's services, since their lines seem to be too long...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

I used to work in a bank. Once I suggested we put a clock on the wall (reading the time on the wacked out terminal was a little difficult). The manager rejected the suggestion - "we don't want people to know how long they've been standing in line."

That a common objection everywhere.  Gambling halls, restaurants, and anywhere else that you might get upset about waiting will refuse to post the time.<br> <br>I worked in a cinema, and I always that that objection was crap: people want to know how late they are!
