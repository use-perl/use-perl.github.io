<p><p>I just got finished making lentil soup with mushrooms and lemon from <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,625636,00.html">a recipe in the <i>Observer</i></a>, which I'd seen recommended (but hadn't gotten around to trying yet) in the January 1 issue of the weblog <a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Lindsay/weblog/latest.html">Bifurcated Rivets</a>, which I found because the guy who writes it runs the Web version of <a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks"><i>The Risks Digest</i></a>, including the PDA version, which along with <i>Salon</i>[0] is my main reading matter for the Metro.
It lives up to his recommendation. I don't care much for Chinese hot-and-sour soup, and this has a little bit of that flavor, but for some reason I like it.</p>

<p>Giant cremini mushrooms have become very popular in the US in recent years under the name "portabello" or "portabella".  But I don't understand why the grocery store had "Baby Bella(R)" mushrooms as well as extremely similar (but more expensive) packages of mushrooms by the same company that were labeled as "cremini".  The "Baby Bella(R)" packages did say "cremini" in parentheses on the side.</p>

<p>[0] <i>Salon</i> may not remain in my Palm much longer if it doesn't abandon its recent practice of truncating many articles and saying the full version is available only to subscribers.  I'd be happy to subscribe (for a reasonable price), but the note at the end of each truncated article says there's no PDA version for subscribers, so this practice serves no purpose other than to frustrate me.  Either put the whole articles in the PDA version or leave them out altogether, damn it.</p></p>
