<p>Should I click?  If he's spamming me to protect himself from spam, I feel like undermining his system, but I guess I'll preserve my record of never responding to challenge-response systems instead. I just hope some reader or robot doesn't <a href="http://app1.mailblocks.com/confirm2.aspx?ck=B2Fqd2Vpc3MObWFpbGJsb2Nrcy5jb20WYW5kcmV3QHNtb2tlc2NyZWVuLm9yZ9iEEb8*&a=1">do it for me</a> within the next several days.</p>

<p>You probably sent him an e-mail and forgot about it.  You might want to send him an e-mail in the future, so go ahead and verify your address now.  He'll give you money if you do!</p>
