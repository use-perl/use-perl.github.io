<p>I bought an iBook today.  I'd been thinking about it for the last few days since I learned the laptop I was hoping to borrow to take to OSCon wasn't going to be available.  Now I just have to get it all figured out and become reasonably comfortable with it in the next week.<br/><br/>I had been planning to do something boring with my income-tax refund like save it, but I guess I must need to make a major impulse purchase every couple of years.</p>

How do you like it so far?

I've only had a couple of hours to play with it, but I've been a little disappointed with how difficult and poorly documented the networking setup is.  I must be missing something, since it just magically worked with Windows 2000.  I still haven't connected to the Internet at home or on the wireless at work.  I guess I'll actually have to call support.<br> <br>Also, I haven't installed the extra memory yet because the screws I have to remove are <em>insanely</em> small.  Why didn't the guy at the Apple store mention that?  He could've at least tried to sell me a toolkit.

Okay, I've connected to the wireless network at work.  It was a problem with the access point, not the iBook.  Things are looking brighter.
