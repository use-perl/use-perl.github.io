<p>Good news! I'm now in full time work again. Nice people, nice working environment, open source friendly, a Mac on my desktop, etc. All good stuff. <br/><br/>Only one bit of bad news. Currently we use CVS. Having spent the past couple of years as a happy subversion user this seemed only mildly annoying. <br/><br/>"It's not going to be that bad", I thought, "Just dig our my old copy of the cederqvist and I'll soon be back in business".<br/><br/>Oh how wrong I was. Two years of everything just working has somewhat spoiled me.<br/><br/><rant><br/><br/>Can't remove a bloody directory? Surely it wasn't that bad? Oh yes - you have to add -P to update and checkout in your .cvsrc so it prunes empty directories. So obvious. Which kind of works - until you actually want an empty directory that is.<br/><br/>Hit Ctrl-C in the middle of a commit and suddenly remember that this isn't going to abort the dumb ass thing I just did because commits are no longer atomic.<br/><br/>Moving stuff! How could anybody create a version control system without support for moving and renaming! <br/><br/>Having to tell CVS what are binary files.<br/><br/>The slow horror of things like magic branches are beginning to rise to the surface of my memory again. Lord how did I put up with CVS for so many years. <br/><br/></rant><br/><br/>Of course the mere fact that we have a source control system puts us leagues ahead of many places I've worked - but shifting from CVS to a vaguely decent system has become.... more of a priority :-)</p>

To be fair, Subversion's rename support only works if you don't have branches.  Because it's implemented as a copy+remove the whole thing breaks down silently during merges.

Which I happened to <a href="http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2005-08/0812.shtml" title="svn.haxx.se">fix</a svn.haxx.se> a while ago.
