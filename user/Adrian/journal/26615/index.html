<p>Does anybody else think that the sort of organisation that <em>starts</em> with a plan involving 3-6 months of 50+ hour weeks is going to end up with something considerably worse?</p>

<p>Can anybody else say <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/013143635X/qid=1125999517/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/026-6675808-8835629">Death March</a>?</p>

<h2>Legendary Japanese work hours?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/itub/">itub</a> on 2005-09-06T21:29:37</h3>
It is often said that people in Japan work long hours. If this is the true, maybe 50 hours is considered average...

<p>Often said - but not necessarily true<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>There's been a sustained government campaign to lower the average working hours in Japan, which seems to have been pretty effective. See some <a href="http://web-japan.org/stat/stats/09LAB42.html" title="web-japan.org">boring statistics</a web-japan.org>.</p>

<p>Even if 50+ hour weeks were average in Japan it wouldn't make it any less dysfunctional.</p>

<h2>Too long</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2005-09-07T11:26:54</h3>
I wouldn't even consider taking a job where 50 hours a week, or even anything &gt; 40 hours, is considered normal.
