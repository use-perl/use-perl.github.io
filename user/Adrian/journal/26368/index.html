<p>It's that last sentence that cracks me up. Because, y'know, nothing deters shoplifters more than a "no shoplifters" sign. Really!</p>

<p>They could, of course, put enough information down the job so that it's harder for people to go "yeah, I can bullshit that". But that would require actual effort wouldn't it.</p>

<p>Feh.</p>

<h2>Real estate listings</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2005-08-19T15:38:49</h3>
<p>You see the same thing in real estate listings.  "Serious buyers only, please," and stuff like that.</p>



<h2>what they mean is..</h2>

Only apply if you meet the spec we can't be bothered to describe properly because we are too lazy to earn our fee.<br><br>Sounds like yet another poor excuse to not respond to enquiries and generally expect something for nothing.

<p>You know, I consider it basic courtesy to at least spell things like these correctly.</p>

<p>If someone is too incompetent to either a) spell correctly or b) use a spellchecker, what are the chances that they&#8217;ll a) be able to tell chancers from solid candidates and b) actually be able to appreciate the expertise and judgement of a solid candidate?</p>

<p>That advert is basically crying out from miles away that you&#8217;re going to expect unreasonable things. I&#8217;d be surprised if anyone <strong>*but</strong> chancers answer that ad. How much do you want to bet that that&#8217;s why that clause got added?</p>
