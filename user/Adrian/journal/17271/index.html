<div class="span8">
<p><p>A few weeks back Tony Bowden nagged me for the Nth time (sorry again Tony) to upload a new version of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/adie/Test-Class/">Test::Class</a> to CPAN.</p>

<p>Various poor innocents, Tony included, have been putting up with  some non-CPAN releases of Test::Class containing a mixed bag of bug fixes, experiments and new features. </p> 

<p>I hadn't made a new CPAN release because of the long list of changes and fixes that I wanted to make to the module. With a little bit of work, so I thought, I could get <em>everything finished</em>! People would stand in awe of all the shiny new Test::Class goodness :-)</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Free Time Fairy never visited and the next release remained "ready in a couple of weeks" for over year and a half.</p>

<p>This is from somebody who preaches about the good things open source and agile development methods give you. Somebody who says regular incremental releases are a <em>good</em> thing.</p>

<p>Bad Adrian. No cookie.</p>

<p>Fortunately Tony's polite poking had some effect on this occasion. I did some tidying and  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/adie/Test-Class-0.06_1/">Test::Class 0.06_1</a> hit CPAN. I knew I would quickly fall back into my old habits, so I told Tony:</p>

<blockquote>
My new years resolution is now to fix at least one bug/feature a week, so expect a new dev release tomorrow night.
</blockquote>

<p>Somehow <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/adie/Test-Class-0.06_2/">Test::Class 0.06_2</a> hit CPAN the next day. Amongst other things it fixed a bug David Wheeler had reported and patched in... gosh where does the time go... January 2002. (<em>Bad</em> Adrian).</p>

<p>After one more week, through some miracle, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/adie/Test-Class-0.06_3/">another Test::Class release</a> managed to escape my subversion repository. Three weeks with a new release each week! How long could this continue?</p>

<p>While exchanging e-mails with David on this very topic I wrote:

<blockquote>
Maybe I should blog it to use.perl.org - that way I'd have the threat of public humiliation.
</blockquote>

<p>Which David thought "A very good idea. ;-)"</p>

<p>I think it's a jolly good idea too. However, since I don't think there's a year's worth of improvements to be made to Test::Class I'm going to modify my resolution to:</p>

<blockquote>
I resolve to make one incremental improvement to my particular corner of the software development world (a new module, a maintenance release, a published article or presentation, etc.) for every week in 2004. Fifty two in all. I'll blog about each one here.
</blockquote>

<p>Since we agile folk like public visible charts of progress I introduce you without further ado to...</p>

Resolution-o-meter: v1.0<br>
Week: 6, 3 weeks behind<br>

</tt>

<p>As you can see I have some catching up to do. But considering I didn't start until 24 January - not too bad. I wonder how the rest of the year will go?</p>

<p>Feel free to pop back at the start of 2005 to point and laugh :-)</p></p>
