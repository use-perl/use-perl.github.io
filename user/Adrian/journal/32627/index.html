<h2>Aargh!</h2>

<p>Why, why, why do people insist upon using this piece of crap database? The arguments I get into typically go like this:</p>

<p> <tt>Them:  "But MySQL is faster."<br>
Ovid:  "Do you have benchmarks?"<br>
Them:  "No, but MySQL is still faster than other databases."<br>
Ovid:  "Have you benchmarked your app with other databases?"<br>
Them:  "No, but others swear up and down that it's faster."<br>
Ovid:  "So you feel that fast is more important that correct answers?"<br>
Them:  "But I already know MySQL."<br>
Ovid:  "That's a fair point.  The Postgres client only speaks Klingon."</tt> </p>

<p>Nobody seems to get that final joke.  If you know MySQL, the switch to Postgres for general use takes about, oh, 30 seconds.  If you know the "advanced" features of MySQL, you probably don't need much persuading to abandon it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I blame phpMyAdmin for the insidious spread of this crappy database.
<p>
I chose PostgreSQL for my own project, and I haven't regretted it one bit. Plus, you can claim it's "enterprise software" to keep the PHB's happy now that it ships with Solaris 10 by default. I think you can even get a service contract with Sun for it if you want (but I'd have to double check).</p>

I don't know Postgres at all, but I can imagine it's not just db "features" and semantics that differ and need to be accounted for, but also the rest of the tool chain, e.g. clients, data loaders, backup procedures, etc. that you need to re-learn.<br><br>All databases suck, but in different ways. MySQL, however, seems special.

<p>Once, I switched an entire 28-node MySQL cluster to a single PostgreSQL instance by making clever use of table inheritance and a one-liner PL/Pgsql script written in Python 3000!  PG RULEZ!!</p>

Now that I use mysql at $work these mysql behaviour s worry me a lot more but at least this is one mysqlism I'm not likely to fall into. I do not expect to be counting nulls in a not null table.

Plus, in what way is '0000-00-00' a valid date? I can only see it as a (badly) stringified version of a NULL date. Thus, it should have been disallowed as an entry in this table. IMO it should be disallowed anywhere.

<p>'0000-00-00' is a valid "zero value" date in MySQL - see <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/datetime.html" title="mysql.com">the docs</a mysql.com> for the evil details.</p>

<p>Needless to say - not my schema.</p>

<p>We had some generic SQL that applied to several tables in similar ways. </p>

<p>... and goddamn it - it's just wrong to say a table is null and not null at the same time<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<h2>But Mysql IS faster...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2007-03-10T12:36:13</h3>
It's even faster than Mysql. In my tests, queries in MyISAM tables are roughly twice as fast as the same queries in InnoDB tables, in the same MySQL server.<br><br>Thus... what is Mysql good for? Mainly for "change once, read many many times" databases, IMO. Such as underlying CMS systems on websites.<br>

<p>Problem with "[Mysql is good for]<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... CMS systems on websites" argurment is whoever uses MySQL would (try to) push|use|propogate elsewhere for any other db related work.</p>

<p>(A rant.) Even more amazing thing is even when one knows that version 4.x is horrible (compared to 5.1, which is actually available), there would be no motivation to upgrade for applications might break.  Version 4.x would keep on laughing &amp; living due to installation of new applications (which would be deined the chance of using a better database system).
</p>
<p>Further, there would be lack of incentive, or actively being told so from higher ups not to, to actually do testing of old applications w/ better DBMS as the resources would be better spent on (mostly) adding new features or modifying existing ones (non-bug related). Something would break (not only applications but also the entity using the database) before the situtation would be fixed.
