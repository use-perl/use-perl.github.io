<p><p>Since Ovid has <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2007/01/five_things_you_didnt_know_abo_1.html">sort of tagged me</a> here are five things you probably don't know about me:</p>

<ol>

<li>I've got a new job! After nearly a year and a half at <a href="http://www.ts.com/">ts.com</a> I'm moving to <a href="http://www.intunet.co.uk/">Intunet</a> from next Monday. The latter has the major advantage of being about fifteen miles from home rather than over one hundred. No more Virgin Trains! I get to see my partner every day and live somewhere pretty! Yay!</li>

<li>Despite living in the UK almost all of my life I've never been to mainland Europe. No reason, just never got around to it. There are too many pretty places in the UK I've not been to yet :-)</li>

<li>I've not driven a car since 1993. I can drive but I don't feel safe doing so. My brain works mostly in "oh look - a pretty flower" mode - which isn't a good attitude to have when in control of several tons of death machine. So, rather than kill somebody, I stopped driving. Since moving back from the US I've never felt the lack.</li>

<li>Until my mid-twenties I was always writing fiction in my spare time. Never sold anything for the excellent reason it wasn't very good - but I had to write it down to get the damn stories out of my head. Haven't felt that <em>need</em> to write for about ten years now. I feel sort of sad about that since it means I'm not a writer.</li>

<li>Slimy things (slugs, worms, etc.) really freak me out. Fine with spiders though.</li>

</ol>

<p>Now I get to tag
