<div class="span8">
<p><p>If your organisation can't find decent developers in the current job market it will almost certainly be due to one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>You are not paying enough</li>
<li>You are doing boring work</li>
</ul>

<p>Pay more. Be less boring. Profit.</p>

<h2>Boring Work</h2>

<p>I'm not looking for work, but I always keep my eye on the market.  If things change, I like to know what I'm facing.  So far, the vast majority of Perl jobs are very, very boring.  There's little challenge.  You have data.  Read it.  Validate it.  Serve it.  Rinse.  Repeat.  Forever.</p>

<p>Admittedly, virtually all programming boils down to that, but some bubbles more colorfully than others.  I'm fortunate that what I am doing now is some of the most interesting work I've ever done.  Even for a considerably larger salary, most work out there is still boring enough that I wouldn't be interested.  Money's important, but it's never enough, so to speak<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Even worse you can hardly ever tell from the job adverts which ones are boring and which ones are interesting. The number of times I've had conversations with agents that go along the lines of "You'll have to tell me what they actually do before i go for an interview"... really.</p>

<blockquote> <div><em> Money's important, but it's never enough, so to speak<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</em></div> </blockquote>

<p>Indeed. The last time I was doing serious job hunting I had a terribly amusing interview with an employer who just couldn't grok that I considered the location (London) a downside.</p>

<p>She wanted me to drop my salary by a few grand because I would have theatre, cinema, museums, etc. Really couldn't understand that I had all those things where I lived at the moment, along with clean air, countryside and vaguely sane housing prices<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>I think London is where you and I part company.  I definitely enjoy large cities and I loved London for the brief time I was there.  Of course, I also have family and friends there, so that probably changes things a bit.</p>

<p>Oh I like London just fine. Indeed, I'm interviewing for a job on Wednesday that'll mean moving there:-)</p>

<p>There's just a tendency with certain Londoners to think it's the centre of the universe and no culture exists outside of its environs. It was the rather unsubtle "Yes - the pay's not very good, and the job's not very interesting - but you'll be living in London you lucky provincial you" attitude that got my goat.</p>
