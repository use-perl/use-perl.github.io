<p>Last year he gave away JAPH t-shirts. This year, 
pink and blue IGNY ones, G for GNU? See slides at 
http://yapc.elixus.org/slides.html 
<br><br>
What's the KISS principle? No, it's Kwiki Is 
Spoon + Spork. So one of the lines is, Only gugod 
truly understands Ingy's KISS. 
<br><br>
gugod's Spork::S5, (http://svn.freepan.org/gugod) 
is Spork on steroids. 
<br><br>
The talk was, Kwiki, the Ritalin and Everything. 
It seemed he wanted to look    within and explain 
why he was different. What did he say about 
Autrijus,       Ritalin and himself? Autrijus 
suggested he take some Ritalin? He suggested     
Autrijus take some Ritalin? He took some of 
Autrijus' Ritalin. Autrijus asked  him if he was 
taking Ritalin? 
<br><br>
The second slide was of 'Republican rocker' Ted 
Nugent (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nugent), 
who played at the first rock show he ever went to 
at the age of 16 in high school. 
<br><br>
The third one was of Barry Manilow 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/               
Barry_Manilow), who they apparently beat up. But 
the song, Mandy, was a good   song, I think.<br/><br/><br><br>
So Kwiki Sucks Rocks, but to get back to 
self-analysis, he said he was a slow   typist. I 
can't remember him saying it at the talk, but on 
the slide he says   he is easily distracted. On 
the other hand, one of his strengths is strong     
legs, and sticking to a theme. Being easily 
distracted seems the opposite of   sticking to a 
theme, but perhaps being distracted happens from 
moment to       moment, and sticking to a theme 
happens over long periods. I think he was      
referring to his work with perl. 
<br><br>
Reinventing everything was both a strength and a 
weakness. 
<br><br>
Anyway he likes Kwiki, because it social and 
distributive. And life is a video  game, the only 
way out of which is to hack, hack, hack, 
collaboratively. 
<br><br>
On the Six, Drugs and Larry Wall slide, he says 
he has ADD. A different         explanation of 
his unconventionality might be the influences on 
him like       Nugent and Wall. 
<br><br>
In a recent p6-l message, Larry Wall says an 
important part of his psychology   was being 
subjected to a lot of 'I'm not offended by what 
you do, but others   might be, so don't do it' 
teaching, in other words, Be Conventional, which 
he  had to work through. Ingy captures this Larry 
Wall spirit. 
<br><br>
He also needed an acoustic guitar, and apparently 
was going to sing at the end  of the conference, 
but was prevented by Autrijus going overtime on 
his perl6   introduction. 
<br><br>
On the weekend at the conference at the 
backpackers hostel I was at there was a terrible 
Hugh Grant movie on TV where the kid wants to get 
through to his      mother by singing at a school 
event, Killing Me Softly with Your Song, but the 
other kids start making fun of his bad singing, 
so Hugh Grant saves the kid by coming out with 
his guitar and helping the kid sing the song, and 
give us a happy ending. 
<br><br>
Just sing the stupid song, stupid kid! They're 
making fun of you is part of the deal, I was 
thinking. 
<br><br>
So, the fact we DIDN'T get to be embarrassed by 
Ingy taking his clothes off and doing Ted Nugent 
impressions was funny. 
<br><br>
He is also apparently working on Cog with Ward 
Cunningham, sort of like Kwiki   from a shell. It 
appears to be somewhere in between vaporware and 
releasable. 
<br><br>
Back to ADD, just as Autrijus was starting his 
2-hour intro to Perl6 and        releasing 
pugs-6.0.13 at the same time, ingy wanted him to 
install a new       Spork::S5Theme. Autrijus 
installed it, but immediately uninstalled it. 
Perhaps he didn't like the pug picture.<br/><br/><br><br>
I wonder why Ingy was doing this. Was he offering 
Autrijus another hoop to keep in the air? Did he 
think the pug picture was important for the 
presentation?   Was this ADD in action?
                                                  
                             His other 
presentation was about FreePAN, also among the 
slides at http://yapc. elixus.org/slides.html. It 
is like CPAN, but with subversion and all 
revisions are available. It looks like it would 
spread out from the Taiwan Academica Sinica's 
Open Foundry. 
<br><br>
I was interested in who he was competing with 
with FreePAN. Afterwards, I tried to ask Leon 
Brocard about the application of the ideas of his 
talk about APIs  into the Yahoo and Google search 
engines to a CPAN shifting more of the load   to 
clients, but he didn't think they had much 
application. 
<br><br>
Then I asked him how he would develop new CPAN. 
He asked me what's wrong with h the old one. I 
said handling perl6 and distributing 2 versions 
of one module. I mentioned the problems with 
modperl 2. He and Sam Vilain didn't have much 
good to say about modperl 2. 
<br><br>
Anyway, Ingy seems to be firmly on the subversion 
and svk bandwagon. Although there may be 
something on the slides about Kwid, he didn't 
talk about it at the conference, I think. He and 
Sam Vilain are apparently working on Perldoc now, 
however.</p>
