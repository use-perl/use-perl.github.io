<h1>G in GNU: Silent or pronounced?</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>Yesterday in Taiwan, Richard Stallman said it is 
pronounced, but I disagree. He talked about the 
etymology of the name. There had been a series of 
FINE, SINE programs, meaning this program Is Not 
Emacs. So he started working down the alphabet 
looking for Something Not Unix and found GNU.<br/><br/><br>
<br>
There apparently had previously been pop culture 
plays on the pronunciation of gnu and seeing it's 
20 years since the platform got going it is not 
'new' anymore. That was basically his case.<br/><br/><br>
<br>
My argument for not pronouncing the G is that we 
need to stop an infinite regress. Or is it Gs all 
the way down? 
<br>
<br>
What does the G in GNU stand for? If it doesn't 
stand for anything, then silence is the 
appropriate pronunciation. If it stands for gnu, 
a gnu, or anything else, ie if the name really 
means A gnu (Entity X) is not Unix, the joke 
isn't so funny. </p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t stand for &#8220;a gnu,&#8221; it stands for &#8220;GNU.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote> <div>

<p>Actually, that&#8217;s the whole point of the acronym: it&#8217;s recursive. If you think that&#8217;s unfunny (I think it&#8217;s mildly amusing the first time you encounter it), you&#8217;ll be completey repelled to learn about the meaning of GNU&#8217;s kernel&#8217;s name, &#8220;Hurd.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hurd: Hird of Unix Replacing Dameons <br>
Hird: Hurd of Interfaces Representing Depth</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

If Stallman's predecessors had called their emacs<br>derivatives, KNEE instead of FINE and SINE, for<br>KNEE's Not Emacs Either, they would have had<br>better and funnier names and Stallman's joke<br>wouldn't have been so funny.<br> <br>Though a knee isn't as funny as a gnu.<br> <br>I don't get the joke in<br> <br>&gt;   Hurd: Hird of Unix Replacing Dameons<br>&gt;   Hird: Hurd of Interfaces Representing Depth<br> <br>What's this Hird thing?

While it is an acronym the animal pronunciation is definately GUH-NEW.

That's definitely the way Stallman pronounced it,<br>but seeing it's probably an East African word,<br>the original pronunciation is no doubt more like<br>'agnew' without the 'a'. Kind of like, 'Gulp,<br>New?' Not 'guh-new.'

Anyone who grew up listening to Flanders and Swan kuh-nows that it is pronounced guh-new.  "I'm a guh-new. How do you do? I'd really like to kuh-now wah-hoo's wah-hoo."

<i>What's this Hird thing? It's not going to be

<p>Actually, it's the lack of "hErd" in the definition that makes it so bloody funny<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p> <p> <i>And rather than choosing GNU, I wonder if it
would have been funnier if Stallman had chosen
something with a silent letter that refered to

ENTERPRISE, FREEFORALL, or something. Perhaps

</p> <p>If you think of a gnu in the wild, running free (or rather eating grass), it starts making sense (I think).

</p> <p> <i>Anyway, a camel is funnier than a gnu. Why is that?</i>

</p> <p>Gnus can't tell jokes properly because they just can't understand them...</p>

A camel is a horse designed by a committee,<br>right? but a gnu is a cow built by Frankenstein.<br>It's an ugly animal.<br>A camel is strange enough to be interesting, but<br>not strange enough to repel.<br> <br>The GNU logo doesn't have the visual appeal of<br>O'Reilly's camel.<br>Perhaps Stallman could have done something with<br>BYRD.

Byrd is a word with no vowels.<br> <br>Perhaps, 'Byrds the Word' and 'The word is Be YeR<br>own Developer' No. Perhaps something like GENIUS<br>+ SOUL = JAZZ
