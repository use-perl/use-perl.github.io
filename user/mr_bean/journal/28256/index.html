<p>Laziness, impatience and hubris, the 3 perl 
programmer virtues may have their source in these 
3 critical personality traits from the Psychology 
of Computer Programming (1971) by Gerald 
Weinberg, apparently one of the first 'people' 
people in programming. <br/><br/>Assertiveness is the other side of the coin of 
humility, and both are necessary. Without 
humility, success leads to overconfidence 
(hubris), which leads to blind self-destruction. 
On the other hand, assertiveness is like a steam 
boiler without a safety valve. And on the 
gripping hand, a spirit of self-criticism is like 
a safety valve without a steam boiler.<br/><br/>This collusion of opposites is a reason for the 
humour of the 3 perl virtues. <br/><br/>The other necessary traits: ability to tolerate 
stressful situations, adaptability to rapid 
change, and neatness. <br/><br/>This book seems to have got under the radar here. 
I wonder why I have heard more about a 
contemporary at IBM, Brooks and his Mythical 
Man-Month, which appears to have come out 4 years 
later in 1975, when essentially the same 
observation is made by Weinberg. <br/><br/>It appears like Brooks he escaped from IBM into 
academia. It appears the suits sent him back to 
do a PhD in psychology. The experience seems to 
have only changed him superficially. I wouldn't 
call the book scientific, despite the inclusion 
of some experiments he did teaching programming. <br/><br/>He tells stories about life as a programmer in 
relation to some ideas of academic psychology. 
One funny one is about 'a military project that 
involved the creating of a world-wide network.' 
The government was getting completely fictional 
accounts of the progress being made. He also says 
that when programmers don't get feedback about 
their work, 'they start to vary the input in 
arbitrary ways to see the effect--to get some 
feedback, even at the risk of a poor evaluation.'<br/><br/>Some interesting hairshirt views about learning: 
'When our program does not run correctly, we have 
the opportunity to learn more specific lessons. 
Quite often, under the pressure of production, 
the programmer is tempted to bypass a trouble 
spot with a fix that he knows will work, since it 
does not use some new technique which he was 
trying to master. .. [But] he will have missed a 
golden opportunity for learning. No time will be 
more propitious for learning than that time at 
which the need for learning is felt most 
strongly--the very moment when we detect an 
error.' <br/><br/>Some principles for language design: Uniformity 
or 'If a programmer asks, Can I write ...? The 
answer should be yes. Just like the child who is 
told, No, too often, the programmer working in a 
nonuniform language will tend to be discouraged 
from trying new things.' This is close to DWIM. I 
thought I saw something close to TIMTOWTDI too, 
but perhaps what I remember was my looking for 
it.</p>
