<p>Perhaps it isn't inactive. There were 70 messages there since Monday and it's now Sunday.<br/><br/>Perhaps all the popular modules have their own mailing lists or other forums. 
Meaning by definition, there won't be many messages.<br/><br/>But even some well-known modules like ingy's don't have forums. In particular, cpanforum didn't spring to mind, when I wanted to post something about Test::Base somewhere.<br/><br/>Perhaps I should have sent it to perl-qa@perl.org.</p>

<h2>What does it do?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2006-03-26T14:28:49</h3>
I guess the question I ask is, what problem does it solve?<br><br>We have rt for bugs, cpanratings for ratings, annocpan for notes, and the larger modules have their own community.<br><br>So what is cpanforum solve exactly.<br><br>

<h2>an open invitation</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mr_bean/">mr_bean</a> on 2006-03-28T00:03:39</h3>
Perhaps it's like a standing or open invitation directed at anyone and          everyone. For you, as a user of this particular module, we offer here the      opportunity to develop a community, whether you want to or not.<br><br>So, yes it is a 'solution looking for a problem'. But perhaps that solution, ie 'the solution looking for a problem,' is not the right solution.<br><br>What is the solution? What is the solution? What is the problem?<br><br>Perhaps YAGNI is a problem? Or is YAGNI NOT a problem?<br><br>The offer of space for a community does not mean a community will develop.<br><br>It would be interesting to find out if communities have developed there, or if  it is helping in other ways. I guess that would mean searching through the     archive of messages.<br><br>One problem is authors who are absent, or who don't see themselves as a help desk for helpless coders.<br><br>That is I guess the problem is helpless coders.

<h2>Not monitored</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2006-03-27T17:40:18</h3>
I looked at that forum a long time ago, but haven't monitored it regularly, and I just noticed a very old <a href="http://www.cpanforum.com/posts/483" title="cpanforum.com">post regarding a problem with one of my modules.</a cpanforum.com> Of course, there isn't enough details to make any kind of diagnosis...I wonder if they still need help<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) I think that kind of help is probably better served at <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/" title="perlmonks.org">Perl Monks</a perlmonks.org>, where someone might have helped or at least asked for more details before I even realized there was a problem<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
