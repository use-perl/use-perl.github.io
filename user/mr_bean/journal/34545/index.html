<h2>There's a place for patches</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rafael/">rafael</a> on 2007-09-26T08:50:23</h3>
Or even several:<br>- the RT queue for List::Util (http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=Scalar-List-Utils)<br>- Graham, directly<br>- perl5-porters, since it's a core module

<h2>Horrified</h2>

I don't think the man page should be changed. I would oppose the real application of this patch. I like it the way it is expressed as it is. I don't even feel the grammatically correct version is more understandable by people whose first language isn't English.<br><br>I am an English teacher. I just found myself thinking how to reformulate the thing.<br><br>I am beginning to think my joke has backfired.
