<div class="span8">
<p>I found Design Patterns in the library while 
looking for a Haskell book and had to read it, 
because I had read so much about it. 
It's quite a different sort of book than Damian 
Conway's Object-Oriented Perl. I haven't actually 
read that book, but judging from the downloadable 
chapters, it's a nuts-and-bolts book. Perl 
provides you some object-oriented jigsaw puzzle 
pieces and Object-Oriented Perl helps you work 
out which pieces fit together to get things done.<br/><br/>Design Patterns, on the other hand, is a top-down 
kind of book. Its focus is on what sorts of 
things get done in object-oriented programming, 
and although there is C++ and Smalltalk code, I 
think it is as an example. The book is not just 
for users of those languages. 
The impact of the book was because of this 
super-language level, I think. It was 
conceptualizing (naming and framing) design 
structures which existed but hadn't been 
recognized and which couldn't be captured in just 
a discussion of language syntax. 
The role of Christopher Alexander in the book is 
interesting. He may have been inspirational, but 
there is hardly anything in it that depends on 
his ideas, I think. 
If he read it, I think he would have felt 
disappointed, because of the lack of real use of 
his ideas. Peter Gabriel has written stuff which 
puts Alexander's ideas to work better, I think.<br/><br/>Actually, I get the feeling that the esteem in 
which Alexander's ideas are held is little 
consolation to Alexander for his inability to get 
architects to take him seriously. 
A better metaphor than architecture is genre 
analysis. It fits in with the language metaphor. 
On the first page they use the analogy of plot 
structure and OO design decisions. 
The book is kind of repetitive. It looks like 
they wrote parts separately, and then put them 
together. The motivations for each pattern are 
often repetitions of the discussion in the Lexi 
case study, which seems not to be a real program, 
but a made-up example. 
I've been reading the book in the kitchen, rather 
than in front of the computer, and although I'm 
doing something with iterators at the moment, I 
don't think the discussion of Iterator pattern is 
going to have much effect on what I'm doing. <br/><br/>Perhaps I'll regret not reading more carefully 
when the book is back in the library and I'm 
struggling with code. 
Actually, they do a good job of teaching. The 
problem is that the real work is done by the 
learner. 
In their brief history of the writing of the 
book, they say in the final year they put a 
greater emphasis on the problem a pattern solves. 
This was connected to the difficulty of learning 
the patterns. The only ones who could understand 
the patterns were the ones who already used them.<br/><br/>This is an important observation. I can't really 
connect my problems with the problems they are 
solving, so I am not going to learn their 
solutions. 
For more serious learners, perhaps end-of-chapter 
exercises will not help very much. The only way 
for learners to learn the patterns is to 
conceptualize everything as a nail and try to hit 
it on the head with a hammer. 
Only when they get a better feeling for what is 
and isn't a nail will they have really learned 
the patterns. Until then, they are trying them 
out. 
This is the reason for the complaint by 
experienced programmers about the rigidity of 
people who have just read the book. They are 
still learning. 
This is a higher-level learning than the learning 
of how to code the patterns, but connected to 
this lower-level learning.</p>
