<p>I counted 6 language mistakes at YAPC::Taipei by 
the famous and not-so-famous. On the Friday night 
birthday party for ingy, acme was talking about 
getting diver instruction certification in 
Florida, so I asked clkao what the diving
was like in Hwalien, but he heard what the 
driving was like. 
Apparently the hackathon was going to take the 
train to Hwalien. Like in Korea, the mountains in 
Taiwan extend down to the sea on the East Coast, 
so the drive is apparently more spectacular than 
the train trip, which goes a lot of the way
through tunnels. But, he said the road is only 2 
lanes, at least some of the way.
<br>
<br>
Then on the Saturday at lunch, he mentioned 
'turbos.' I couldn't understand and it took 
mugwump a while to explain, before I realized he 
had said 'tarballs.' 
Then during obra's talk, obra mentioned turbos 
too, and it took me an instant to recognize that 
he had *also* said tarballs. 
American English /a/ is less open. This had 
always troubled me in Korea, where Top Gun was 
pronounced to my ears, Tup Gon. 
<br>
<br>
Or perhaps I just need to clean my ears out, 
because when the British New Zealander mugwump 
asked the presenter on Mail::SpamAssassin about 
'graydists,' I didn't understand again.
Only afterwards at lunch with colleagues of the 
speaker did I find out mugwump had been talking 
about graylists. I thought he had been talking 
about Paul Graham.
<br>
<br>
It could be because these were technical words 
that I had probably only ever seen in print 
before, and which I had never written down, that 
this occurred. 
<br>
<br>
autrijus's talk about perl6 was in Chinese and 
the slides were in Chinese too, so although the 
talk was interesting I didn't understand all of 
it, or even 50 percent of it.
<br>
<br>
I could understand more of the slides, but one 
interesting point was it appeared he was claiming 
a Lutheran Reformation in perl's development. I
thought he seems to be taking the religious 
imagery of Apocalypses, Exegeses and Apocrypha in 
an interesting and new direction. 
Only 16 hours later on the way home past a big 
sign did I realize he had been talking about the 
transformations in the camel. 
I asked my students later that day what the 
Chinese for camel was, and they said, 'luotuo.' 
Not actually 'Lute,' but pretty close. 
<br>
<br>
'Luotuo' incidentally sounds similar to the 
Japanese 'rakuda' and Korean 'naktha,' but the 
characters are different. 
Chinese, Japanese and Korean words often have the 
same etymological roots, with the same Chinese 
character. But giraffe is also different. In 
Japanese and Korean it is 'kirin.' In Chinese it 
is, 'chang jing lu' or long-necked deer. In
Chinese, a kirin is a cameleopard.
<br>
<br>
clkao has an interesting picture in his svk talk 
of a camel and a giraffe together.</p>
