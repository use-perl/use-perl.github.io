<p>Something from Dan Kogai's blog a couple of years ago at http://dan.co.jp/user/dankogai I thought I should not just delete from my hard drive.<br/><br/>From the school of subjects, to the school of experience<br/><br/>Now also the fact that I wasn't the loser was because I early on realized this:<br/><br/>  For them, education doesn't work. The reason is 
  teachers are people who have left school only to 
  enter it, and don't know anything about the 
  world outside. They are dinosaurs, who don't 
  know that marketing, productivity, and 
  management result in innovation. School is like 
  a factory run by dinosaurs to reproduce 
  dinosaurs.
               --another Japanese blogger<br/><br/>But it is also a fact that school is a Difference Amelioration Device (DAD).<br/><br/>What made the advanced countries--all of them--advanced was the invention and the implementation of a route to education independent of family. "Not following in the footsteps of one's family is sometimes a good thing." It made possible a more appropriate sharing of wealth for individuals and increased the earning power of everyone overall. It made it possible for even people on lower salaries in advanced countries to enjoy luxuries that were impossible for royalty in the past.<br/><br/>The loss of the impression that mobile phones and annual overseas vacations are a luxury is the result of a comparison with one's surroundings.<br/><br/>=cut</p>
