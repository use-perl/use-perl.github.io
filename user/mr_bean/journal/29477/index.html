<p>The first question I asked Audrey at OSDC.tw was was the new name of pugs Bugs. She said that Larry's Bugs Manifesto <a href="http://blog.livedoor.jp/dankogai/mov/lamdaorz.mov> was an April Fool's Joke.<br">http://blog.livedoor.jp/dankogai/mov/lamdaorz.mov> was an April Fool's Joke.<br</a><br/>What a disappointment!<br/><br/>Before going any further, here is some material on Taiwanese bugs. I tried looking round for an Internet Taiwan bugarium, but couldn't find one. Here's he National Taiwan University Department of Entomology's collection of Chinese paintings of bugs. <a href="http://www.entomol.ntu.edu.tw/index-c.htm><br">http://www.entomol.ntu.edu.tw/index-c.htm><br</a><br/>I find the Bugs Manifesto moving. I'm not too sure why. It's probably the delivery and the fact I can't understand what Larry is saying.<br/><br/>In actual fact, he's probably just taking off Josh McAdams' Southern accent in the perl podcasts <a href="http://www.perlcast.com> And the text appears to be a pastiche of Audrey's manifesto at <URL:http://pugscode.org/talks/oscon05/movies.html><br">http://www.perlcast.com> And the text appears to be a pastiche of Audrey's manifesto at <URL:http://pugscode.org/talks/oscon05/movies.html><br</a><br/>But I prefer an alternative scenario.<br/><br/>Picture Larry, as a teenager, listening to the bugs one summer night after a tiring, but rewarding, afternoon playing the violin with the youth orchestra, and the night music reminding him of the music he had been playing a couple of hours before.<br/><br/>Stirred to listen to some more classical music, he turns on the radio and searches around for the local classical music station, but at the expected frequency, instead there is a country music station with a powerful transmitter, welling up from the South on the night air. The mood is spoiled and he thinks: 'Where'd those hillbillies come from? Get them out of here!'<br/><br/>More than 20 years later, in Japan, the fact bugs rhymes with pugs allows him to have some fun with that memory and the work of Josh McAdams and Audrey. <br/><br/>Audrey played the manifesto at her perl6 tutorial at OSDC.tw. Again, I was moved. But I'm glad I had first heard it before seeing Larry delivering it. (Apparently I don't have the right compression program.) The visuals of Larry delivering the manifesto overpower the message of the manifesto.<br/><br/>Here is this guy jumping up and down and twitching. I too recognized Scientology's lord master Xenu.  <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=540655><br">http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=540655><br</a><br/>Hey! If Larry can make fun of the South, Josh McAdams, country music, perlcast, Audrey, Taiwan, pugs AND bugs, we can make fun of him too.
