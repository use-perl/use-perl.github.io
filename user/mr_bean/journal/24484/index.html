<p>A mathematician is a device for turning coffee 
into theorems. If coffee is not to theorems as 
money is to perl6, what is the relationship 
between free open source software and money? 
<br><br>
The firestorm at 
<URL:http://use.perl.org/news/05/02/14/1523219.sh
tml?tid=37&tid=42> seems to have been partly over 
accounting practices. One poster suggested that 
people contribute to worthy causes according to 
their perception of the efficiency of the 
distributing agency. 
<br><br>I thought that may apply only when there are 
agencies competing for the donor's money. If 
there is only one way to contribute to a worthy 
cause, then your mind is on the worthiness of the 
cause and less on the efficiency of the cause's 
agent. 
<br><br>But if such is not the case, why not bring the 
YAS back into existence, and have it compete with 
the TPF in the form of a race to fund developers 
and reach milestones? People might be excited by 
the prospect of an easy expression of their views 
about perl6 in the form of a choice of whether to 
give their money to the YAS or the TPF.
<br><br>
You're supposed to laugh, but I depressed MYSELF.</p>
