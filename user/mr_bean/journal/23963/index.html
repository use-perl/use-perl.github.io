<p>I expected him to be a swarthy man, but knowing 
he was in New Zealand, guessed this fair-haired 
guy with dreadlocks and a hobbit hat was Sam 
Vilain. The name, mugwump apparently comes from 
William S Burroughs. <br/><br/><br>
<br>
At Ingy's birthday party, one of the Chinese 
hackers noted that the next birthday Ingy would 
have with a full moon would be 19 years from now, 
perhaps something every Chinese person knows, I 
don't know. <br/><br/><br>
<br>
This lead to a discussion by mugwump with me 
about the lunar calendar. I said the idea of 
planting crops according to it meant that it 
could vary by a month, according to the solar 
calendar. <br/><br/><br>
<br>
He started discussing the ideas of a New Zealand 
mathematician on 19-year cycles in the weather, 
as a result of the effect of the moon. He said 
the mass of the moon was one tenth of that of the 
earth and the gravitational pull on the earth 
from the moon was greater than that of the sun. <br/><br/><br>
<br>
I couldn't accept that at the time, but thinking 
about variations over the short-term in the 
stress placed on the earth, then the effect of 
the moon would certainly be greater than that of 
the sun. <br/><br/><br>
<br>
And if the moon moves the water round in the form 
of tides, then it must be moving the air around 
too. <br/><br/><br>
<br>
He noted that there had been an earthquake in the 
same area as the recent tsunami, in the Indian 
Ocean, in 1833. I started thinking how many years 
that is. Is it really a multiple of 19?<br/><br/><br>
<br>
He said that someone from the New Zealand Weather 
Bureau had spoken against the theory, claiming 
the Butterfly Effect meant that such cycles were 
not possible. I agreed with him that the 
Butterfly Effect was only an explanation of the 
absence of cycles, rather than one of why it was 
not possible to have cycles. <br/><br/><br>
<br>
I realized that although he may be mad, there was 
method to his madness. <br/><br/><br>
<br>
He talked a little about subatomic particles, 
before starting to talk about Chinese and Western 
medicine. He said the difference was like that 
between tuning a car, and taking the engine apart 
and cleaning out the cylinders. <br/><br/><br>
<br>
He asked me whether I went to an acupuncturist or 
Western doctor. At this point I started backing 
away. <br/><br/><br>
<br>
I asked him to say a little about Tangram. He 
said, it is a relational database. But then he 
said it isn't. I feared for his presentation the 
next day. <br/><br/><br>
<br>
He repeated that in the conference the next day, 
but it was a great presentation. He reminded me 
of a popular Scottish conference presenter in 
Korea, and I wondered if it was a British 
academic presentation style. I think it was 
partly because he smiled a lot, knew the subject 
well (apparently his dad worked on databases also 
at Unisys), and was relaxed and confident.<br/><br/><br>
<br>
Although the organizers weren't too happy about 
him going overtime. I think they had taken note 
of mjd's claim that most conference participants 
attend for the food. <br/><br/><br>
<br>
Certainly the food at the conference was very 
good. In Korea, they say, Chinese food, a 
Japanese wife, and an American home. <br/><br/><br>
<br>
Afterwards he told me about junctions in perl6 
allowing you to do logical programming eg, if any 
of A, B, or C is true, do X. This allowed him to 
write perl6 code to solve the SEND+MORE=MONEY 
puzzle in just a few lines. <br/><br/><br>
<br>
But he showed me SQL is even quicker at solving 
the puzzle and that this is because it was 
designed to do just that: model set-theoretic 
relationships.</p>

<h2>On the sun, moon and tides...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mugwumpjism/">mugwumpjism</a> on 2005-04-02T06:10:27</h3>
<p>The mathematician is Ken Ring - his site is at <a href="http://www.predictweather.com/" title="predictweather.com">http://www.predictweather.com/</a predictweather.com>, and he mentioned the 1833 earthquake in his <a href="http://lists.topica.com/lists/weather/read/message.html?mid=911313230&amp;sort=d&amp;start=112" title="topica.com">December 29, 2004 e-zine</a topica.com>.  1833 + 19 * 9 is indeed 2004.

</p><p>Turns out I misinterpreted what Ken said... the moon is actually 1/80th the mass of the earth, not 1 tenth, and the gravitation effect thing is a net measurement of the effects on the ocean.  The reasoning is that because the tides are predominantly affected by the moon and not the Sun, that the net force created by the moon must be more.    According to textbook gravitational equations, and estimated values for the mass of the Sun, Earth and Moon (actually, these values are derived from the result, but we'll ignore that for now) - the sun exerts about 100 times the gravitational force compared with the sun.  Yet we do not see a lunar tide 1/100th the size of the tide from the sun.  Confused?  Not as much as psysicists should be<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).</p>

You mean?<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the sun exerts about 100 times the gravitational<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; force compared with the moon. Yet we do not see<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a solar tide 100 times the size of the tide<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from the moon.<br> <br>The solar tide is what we see with spring and<br>neap tides, I think. Spring tides are higher and<br>lower than neap tides, because the moon is new or<br>full.<br> <br>But how do we separate out the variation in water<br>movement due to the moon and that due to the sun?<br> <br>Some places only have one large tide a day. Like<br>the gulf between China and Korea. Also in Taiwan?<br> <br>And for places that have 2 tides, why at the new<br>moon don't we get one tide instead when the water<br>rushes all to one side attracted by the moon and<br>sun together? Why does the water hang out on the<br>back side, away from both the sun and the moon? I<br>guess there is some sort of jello quivering going<br>on.<br> <br>The changes in the air are changes in pressure. I<br>don't think there are changes in water pressure<br>with tidal movement, are there?<br> <br>Anyway, the moon's affect on the weather: Food for<br>thought.
