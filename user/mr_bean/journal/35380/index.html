<p>CLKAO had a picture of a camel and giraffe in his slides for his introduction to svk, but I can't find that now. Here are some other similar pictures off <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/bentbacktulips/1050904735/>flickr.com</a> and <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/skoop102/117234440/>flickr.com</a>. These confirm that the animals are similar. But the contrast is striking.
<br>
There was apparently a giraffe-like camel. <a href=http://piclib.nhm.ac.uk/piclib/www/image.php?img=47134&search=usa>Aepycamelus, a Miocene camel</a>
<br>
Bewick's woodcut of the giraffe also gives it a very camel-like face.
<br>
Continuing my discussion of Wikipedia articles on the moose and other animals commenting on <a href=http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=38201&cid=60154>MooseX</a>, the article on <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffe>the giraffe</a> talks about the fact its forelegs are 10 percent longer than hindlegs and its gait at low speeds and high speeds.
<br>
This led me on to the entry on <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_gait>horse gaits</a>, which will tell you more about the subject than you ever wanted to know.
<br>
Child to Pear's Children's Encyclopedia editor: Your encyclopedia told me more about penguins than I cared to know.
<br>
But apparently the gait of giraffes at slow speed, pacing, moving both the legs on the left side together and then those on the right side together, is not a natural gait for horses. Their working gait is the trot, in which diagonally opposite legs are moved together. This is a fairly stable gait for the horse, if less so for the rider.
<br>
But horses can be trained to pace. It is, however very uncomfortable for a rider on top of a pacing horse, rocked from side to side in a rapid rhythm. 
<br>
According to the article, camels also pace naturally, but being taller, their rate of stepping is slower, so 'a rider can follow the rocking motion.'
<br>
I guess that's where the camel gets its Ship of the Desert name from the rider being rolled out about on top of, more so than on top of a stable horse.
<br>
I wonder what I could learn from <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel>what is probably the camel entry</a>? Probably more than I ever wanted to know.</p>

<h2>Latin</h2>

Don't forget the Latin name: <em>camel</em>eopardalis.  Apparently they looked like a cross between a camel and a leopard to early explorers.
