<p>I asked him whether there were many ruby 
programmers in Japan, because Matsumoto is 
Japanese. This was ambiguously a question about 
either the number of ruby programmers in Japan, 
or the nationalism of Japanese programmers.<br/><br/><br><br>
He answered yes, and added, perl is for cool 
uses, while php is for dummies, java is for 
companies, and ruby is ... for hackers. <br/><br/><br><br>
At the conference he presented a number of web 
and blog hacks, some from his O'Reilly book, Blog 
Hacks, at present only available in Japanese.<br/><br/><br><br>
But the ruby connection was in the first 
presentation. Apparently the source code search 
engine gonzui supported searching php, ruby and 
python code, but not perl, I guess because the 
only thing that parses perl is perl. 
<br><br>
He used PPI to parse perl, but still had to hack 
parsing of method calls for example, by 
look-behind matching on '->'. 
<br><br>
Integrating it into gonzui, a ruby program, 
required him to write his first code in ruby 
apparently. 
<br><br>

His talk gave me the warm fuzzies. It's always 
good to see East Asians kick ass in the 
international arena. This was apparently his 
first perl presentation outside Japan. I imagine 
he must get practice presenting in English at 
Moveable Type, however. 
<br><br>
Dan Kogai doesn't act like a Japanese, but 
Miyagawa did. 
<br><br>
mjd last year in Taipei contrasted the East Asian 
style of presentation and audience participation 
with the Israeli type, where a successful 
presentation is measured by how many in the 
audience speak up to attack what you said.<br/><br/><br><br>
At the conference, Miyagawa announce YAPC::Asia 
to be arranged by the Sibuya Perlmongers in 
Tokyo. 
<br><br>
I hope they make it at least a 2-country tour so 
the programmers coming from the US and elsewhere 
can first come to Taipei for one weekend and then 
go to Tokyo for the next. 
<br><br>
Participants in the Tamsui Hackathon here were 
in-country for almost a week and next year, 
perhaps they can come back to Taiwan for 3-4 days 
and then go to Japan for 3-4 days.</p>
