<p>I couldn't remember the name of Module::CoreList, the module that tells you in which version modules in core made it into the core. I thought it was CoreVersion, but searching for core and coreversion and version on cpan didn't turn it up.<br/><br/>[Actually going back, now I find it's between 300-400 of the 1456 modules CPAN search returns for 'core'. But that's too far at the back. I didn't find it, anyway. I was turned off by Lingua::Stem, README.hpux, Chemistry::Atom in the list before it. All good modules, probably, but not at this moment.]<br/><br/>Googling on 'perl how tell what version core module dual life cpan made' also didn't turn it up.<br/><br/>I hope this message will make it easier for me when I'm looking for it next time. Easier because either Google finds it, or I remember I posted here about it.<br/><br/>I asked on freenode's #perl and someone gave me the answer straight away. Buubot there also answers questions of the form 'core:Module::CoreList'<br/><br/>You can use Module::CoreList this way to find when it made its own way into the core.<br/><br/>perl -MModule::CoreList -e "print Module::CoreList->first_release('Module::CoreList')"<br/><br/>Why do I want to know? I want to know how much I may require a user to install by using certain modules.<br/><br/>But perhaps there is a more extensive way to answer such questions.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/domm/">domm</a> on 2007-01-22T11:46:29</h3>
<p>Or use the <code>corelist</code> programm that comes with Module::CoreList:
</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>~$ corelist Module::CoreList<br> <br>Module::CoreList&nbsp; was first released with perl 5.009002</tt></div> </blockquote>

<p>
And don't you forget <tt>corelist</tt> accepts regexes as well (since 2.05):</p><p><blockquote> <div><tt>$ corelist<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/^Time/i<br> <br>Time::HiRes&nbsp; was first released with perl 5.007003<br> <br>Time::Local&nbsp; was first released with perl 5<br> <br>Time::gmtime&nbsp; was first released with perl 5.004<br> <br>Time::localtime&nbsp; was first released with perl 5.004<br> <br>Time::tm&nbsp; was first released with perl 5.004</tt></div> </blockquote>

<h2>CoreList = useful module with terrible name</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/doom/">doom</a> on 2008-05-08T14:29:30</h3>
I was just bitten the same way.  I've used this several times now, and couldn't remember the name "CoreList" to save my life, and the search listing on cpan was worthless.  I eventually did a "man -k Module" on my box, and carefully read through the list.<br/><br/>It just goes to show that names are important, particularly with CPAN, which essentially has no other way of navigating.
