<h1>Thoughts on a Ctypes::Type object API</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>For the past few days I've been considering and experimenting with the design of simple Ctypes::Type objects. These are objects which, funnily enough, represent C data types for manipulation in Perl.</p>
<b>The reference implementation</b>
<p>Looking at the Python ctypes module, there were various things I didn't like. <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html#fundamental-data-types">Python's simple types</a> [0] can be summarized thusly:
<pre>
>>> i = c_int(42)
>>> print i
c_long(42)
>>> print i.value
42
>>> i.value = -99
>>> print i.value
-99
>>>
</pre><br />
Having to specify <code>i.value</code> seemed cumbersome for an object which essentially represents just that value and some rules for what kinds of values it can contain. So I started trying various things with <code>tie</code>'ing and <code>overload</code>ing. Indeed, I was about to start a <a href="http://gitorious.org/perl-ctypes/perl-ctypes">fourth project branch on types</a> [1] before reigning in and having another think about fundamental behaviour.</p><br /><br />
<b>Metaphor clash</b>
<p>The <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/overload.html#Metaphor-clash">'Metaphor Clash' section</a> [2] of perldoc <code>overload</code> made clear the difficulty I was having with my thinking. If you want to be able to say simply,
<pre>
$int_obj = 42;        # assign new value to Ctypes::Type::c_int object
</pre><br />
and not have $int_obj smushed and replaced by a simple IV, you're forced to do something like,<br /><br />
<pre>
$other_obj = $int_obj->copy();
</pre><br />
on those occasions when that's the outcome you really want. That might not be regular for objects in Perl, but I think that this is more suitable in this domain, where as I mentioned before, objects are just there to represent special kinds of values. Particularly, it would let you do this:<br /><br />
<pre>
$c_int = $c_long;        # Put long value into integer type, with
                         # appropriate checking on STORE
</pre><br />
rather than having to say<br /><br />
<pre>
$c_int->val = $c_long->val;
</pre><br />
</p>
<b>Normal usage</b>
<p>I think that once you've instantiated a Ctypes::Type object, what you're going to be doing 90% of the time is assigning values to it or assigning its value to other things. The times when you want to squash the object with a different object or value, instead of just creating a new one, will be rare, and there can be special methods for doing those things.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is this a reasonable generalisation to make? How would <em>you</em> like Type objects to work?</p>
<b>Other issues</b>
<p>There are a couple of other issues tangential to this which I'd like to flag up while we're at it...
<ul><li>The latter behaviour, while IMO preferable, will I think be harder to implement. I haven't yet found a way using only Perl to hide the process of <code>tie</code>'ing a variable from the user. This is horrible:<br /><br />
<pre>
my $int = 5;    # regular scalar
c_int(\$int);    # make it a Ctypes::Type
</pre><br />
but it's one of the only ways to enable the assignment of new values to the object without using an accessor every time (the other way is returning a reference from <code>c_int()</code> and requiring users to say <code>$$int</code> all the time). I think the desired effect would be possible, but <code>c_int()</code> will have to be written in XS. That's fine, but I want to sound out opinions on whether I'm making the right choices on functionality first.<br /></li>
<li>The latter behaviour, while IMO better than that in Python's ctypes, may represent a significant difference from the de facto 'conventional' way of doing things. This raises a bunch of issues to be addressed in a subsequent post.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Please do let me know what you think of the above proposals. I'm highly suggestible.</p>
