<p><p>I finally got wxWidgets to compile on Windows with gdiplus using MinGW. I didn't realise GCC actually looks for libs in a completely different way to MSVC. Had to copy over and edit some headers from the MS platform SDK, since MinGW doesn't come with gdiplus yet.</p>
<p>I don't know what the legal position would be on packaging up the files with the edits I made and making them available for download. The originals are freely available in SDKs from download.microsoft.com... anyone have any advice on this?</p>
<p>I've also read through the majority of <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlxstut.html" target="_new">perlxstut</a>. I actually spent a long time looking for anything saying explicitly how to use external libraries; all the examples in perldoc I looked at were based on making one's own .c/.h files. Fair enough, it turned out to be <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=212728" target="_new">delightfully simple</a>, but these things are only obvious when you know the answer (thanks to <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=82147" target="_new">Zaxo</a> for revealing the elegant truth).</p>
<p>I've also been examining the wxWebKit headers and example program, along with the documentation on the wxWebKit site. It looks fairly manageable. I'd hope to have a demo working within a couple of days (although I'm going to my graduation this week so won't get to work on until the weekend).</p>
<p>The part that still seems tricky is setting everything up to install automatically, like the Alien::wxWidgets currently does. The wxWebKit source is currently <a href="http://gitorious.org/wxwebkit" target="_new">hosted at gitorious.org</a>, so I don't know if LWP will be able to pull it down from there easily. I can worry about that later though.</p></p>

<p>What we do with Perl::Dist (the toolkit we use to build Strawberry) is to avoid pulling from the original sources entirely (since they are far too unreliable).</p><p>Instead, we download the tarballs to a known-good location (I use <a href="http://strawberryperl.com/packages/" title="strawberryperl.com">http://strawberryperl.com/packages/</a strawberryperl.com>) and then the Alien/etc module hardcodes in that path instead.</p><p>Since you aren't modifying the tarball, there should be no legal problems.</p>

<p>I wouldn't be modifying the WebKit tarball, but I did modify the Microsoft gdiplus headers. That would probably make them a no-go for making available elsewhere; I suppose the best I could do would be a script to apply my changes to a set downloaded from the MS site.</p><p>gdiplus is only needed for compiling with wxGraphicsContext though, which isn't actually required (as I'd thought), wxDC will do. I'll probably try putting a WebKit tarball up somewhere, depending on what it look like when the build system changes in the next week or so.</p>
