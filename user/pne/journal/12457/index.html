<div class="span8">
<p>I saw a link to some O'Reilly books here on use.Perl and, on those pages, saw a link to "Register your books".<br/><br/>I went through the process of signing up (even though I don't have my books with me right now), just because I was curious. This brought me to <a href="https://epoch.oreilly.com/register/register.asp">a page</a> which invited me to enter the ISBNs of O'Reilly books I owned -- <b>with no dashes or spaces</b>.<br/><br/>Um.<br/><br/>Come on. How long would it take to sanitise input with a little Perl script which simply discards dashes and spaces, or simply all non-digits? It could even validate the checksum at the same time. Heck, even in C, which is not known for its native string-processing capabilities, chucking out dashes and spaces sounds like a piece of cake.<br/><br/>I think that doing so would have made the site more customer-friendly. After all, computers are supposed to help us; we're not there to help computers. Especially if the canonicalisation of user input is so trivial as here.<br/><br/>I get similarly annoyed when my bank requires that I enter bank sort codes as eight digits without spaces. Sort codes in Germany are usually displayed as 123&nbsp;456&nbsp;78 - eight digits grouped as three, three, two. Requiring eight consecutive digits, and making the field maxlength=8, means that I can't copy and paste a sort code in standard format from an external source, say, an email; my browser will truncate at 8 and give "123&nbsp;456&nbsp;", and even if it didn't, the web form would complain about the spaces.<br/><br/>The customer shouldn't have to care in which format the bank stores its information. Rather, in my opinion, the site should adapt to accept non-standard input and clean it up. (Certainly if it's only a matter of stripping spaces - and perhaps slashes and hyphens from the bank account number, which is a bit less standardised.)</p>

<h2>The people who make the UI don't properly test it</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2003-05-27T17:16:21</h3>
<p>This has long been a thorn in my side. Why does the GUI/UI not do what you'd actually expect, and do something stupid instead. Why when it could take XYZ123 and remove anything that's not a 123, does it instead pop-up an annoying Javscript message to tell you "don't do that".</p>

<p>Examples of bad UI- and please add more:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eurostar's UK reservations that don't allow for accented letters, or titles other than MR, MISS, MS and MRS</li>
<li>Many web forms that want a number in a specific format, but instead of cleaning the input up annoy you with a JavaScript popup - that's can actually get it wrong</li>
<li>Web forms that have a strange tab order- the old UK Railtrack timetable did this</li>
<li>Forms that don't allow you to paste data in- why?</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.fixingyourwebsite.com/mysterymeat.html" title="fixingyourwebsite.com">Mystery-meat</a fixingyourwebsite.com> web navigation</li>
<li>Forcing a Java or Flash applet to start on the front page, but seeing as you skip onto to content you never actually use it</li>
</ul>

<p>Has no one who designs web sites ever checked the W3C XHTML and CSS specifications, and read about <a href="http://www.useit.com/" title="useit.com">usability</a useit.com> or <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/" title="w3.org">accessibility</a w3.org>?</p>
