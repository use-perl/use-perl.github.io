<p>Oh well, one of my hosted web sites had the server get 0wned... my web page suddenly took quite a bit longer to load and looked rather different, too.<br/><br/>The hosting company appeared to notice pretty quickly, though -- when I telnetted into the box from another machine on the same network (ssh didn't work any more) to see whether my files were still there, five minutes later I got a broadcast message from root telling me the system was going down.<br/><br/>Afterwards, things appeared to work... mostly. My Perl scripts, including the one that filters my mail, were all broken since Perl had moved. Previously /usr/bin/perl was 5.004 and /usr/local/bin/perl was 5.005_03, so I used the latter -- now, there was only one Perl, 5.6.0, and it lived in /usr/bin. Some of the modules they had installed for me were also gone, so I had to adjust 'use lib' paths and installed them locally for the time being.<br/><br/>Fortunately, mail appears to work again. Having mail bounce is ugly.</p>
