<div class="span8">
<p>Today, while practising English verbs with my wife, I remembered something I had read somewhere -- that English distinguishes word-final voiced consonants not so much by the voicing but by the length of the vowel.<br/><br/>And when I think about it and consider minimal pairs such as <em>bag</em> and <em>back</em>, or <em>send</em> and <em>sent</em>, the word ending in a voiced consonant does have a considerably longer vowel sound. Yet I never used to think about it and thought the only difference was in the voicing of the consonant.<br/><br/>Perhaps something to think about for people such as Russian and German speakers who devoice final voiced consonants -- if they lengthen the vowel properly it might make up for their difficulty in voicing the consonant.</p>

I think the difference is duration on the vowel is most noticeable with stops.
<p>Also, in my dialect (Los Angeles English),<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/og/ and<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/ok/ (with short o's) end up realized rather differently: "log" and "lock" sound almost like "lawg" versus "lahk"-verging-on-"lack".
</p><p>May dialects also have weird rules about how a long<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/i/ is affected by a following voiced or voiceless consonant.  In my dialect it's pretty clear: uh-y before voiceless, ah-y before voiced.  But it's quite different here in New Mexico: one seems to get a lot more ah-y in contexts where my dialect wouldn't permit it, like "right" coming out with exactly the same vowel as "ride".</p>
