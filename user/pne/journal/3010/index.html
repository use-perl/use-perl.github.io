<p>I finally decided to get off my behind and submit Games::Dice to the PAUSE. I was rather shamed when I saw that the files were dated April 1999... they've been sitting around my hard drive here at work for a <strong>long</strong> time. But I decided it was probably best to "release early, release often" so I cast it loose. And as I remember the docs were fairly decent and the module worked last time I touched it. It doesn't have any tests beyond the one h2xs gives you, though (but testing random things is a tad difficult, anyway).<br/><br/>It used to be that I had one module on the Module List but not on CPAN and several on CPAN but not on the Module List... well, now my Module List module is also on CPAN. I uploaded v0.02 the next day after minor tweaking (changing my email address and adding a licence); v0.01 will probably go away again. I do wish that I got some reaction to my request for registering the other modules. modules@perl.org appears to be a black hole at times... but that's another story.<br/><br/>I also had a go at implementing <a href="http://www.yenc.org/">yEnc</a>. For that module, I really did "release early, release often": v0.01 of Convert::yEnc had no decoding, v0.02 had no prerequisites listed in Makefile.PL and v0.03 still has no decent docs or tests. But at least it compiles! Maybe I'll get around to working on it some more later.<br/><br/>I'm also wondering whether there are any modules dealing with "metric time" (100 seconds to the minute, 100 minutes to the hour, 10 hours to the day) or with the 28-hour day (which you can read about in a couple of places on the web; briefly, it divides the week into 6*28 hours rather than 7*24). A quick glance at search.cpan.org didn't unearth anything likely.</p>

<h2>Question, suggestion</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2002-02-23T06:16:31</h3>
As a old wargamer (not a role-player, though), this might come in handy.  I've tinkered with the idea of converting <i>Britannia</i> into a Tk app.  I even started it, just making the population chart and the turn chart.
<p>
I'm curious how your module differs from the Games::Die module (other than the fact that I can see your documentation online).  I also wonder if your module could be made as a subclass of Pete Stewart's Games::Object module.
</p><p>
I have one suggestion, though I'm not sure how you'll feel about it.  I've always liked to know the probability of rolling "x" with whatever dice combination I'm using.  Any chance of adding some sort of probability calculator?  That way I can bitch and moan with a little more authority when I get beat at Axis and Allies by saying, "yeah, well, I *should* have won that game.  I clearly had a 62.4% chance of winning the most critical battle of the game!".
</p><p>
Oh, and while I'm thinking of it, how about Tk::Dice?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p>
This is a work in progress here, so I keep coming up with ideas...
</p><p>
What about permanately tracking the dice rolls.  In other words, after rolling 2d6 one hundred times, I could grab and print a hash that stored all the values I had hit in those 100 rolls.</p>

<p>One difference is that my module was applied for and written in 1999, when there was very little in Games::*. Only I never got around to uploading it to CPAN. I haven't looked at Games::Die.</p>

<blockquote><div> <p> <i>I've always liked to know the probability of rolling "x" with whatever dice combination I'm using. Any chance of adding some sort of probability calculator?</i> </p> </div></blockquote>

<p>I've got a version of the module with an object-oriented interface which was submitted to me by someone else; it has methods for all sorts of statistical things. One reason why I didn't upload Games::Dice was that I was wondering whether (and how) to integrate that code. I'm still thinking about it.</p>
