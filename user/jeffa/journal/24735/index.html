<p>I started reading 'On The Road' by Kerouac this past Sunday night. Yesterday after work, after finding out that my father did *not* send me the money he owes me from the car sales, and with less than $20 in my checking account, i decided to charge a $35 plate of chirashi on the credit card. Afterwards, i sat down in Union Square park and read about 50 pages from said book. Some guy was shouting in his megaphone, saying something to likes of "Bush is afriad of you!" ... I highly doubt that.<br/><br/>I feel like a slug this morning. Got to work a little later than usual, but i'm still 'on time.' Just called my dad to make sure that he's gonna put the money in today, like he was suppose to yesterday. I checked my bank account, and sure enough the bastards had some pending transactions 'hiding in the cracks' ... no-one can convince me that they do not do that on purpose. I didn't go in the red, and even if i did that does not justify them charging me $20 per "overdraft" ... it's all electronic, there is no paperwork anymore. I'm switching to a credit union ASAP!<br/><br/>Last night i watched Milton Moses Ginsberg's "Coming Apart" with Rip Torn and Sally Kirkland. Quite the mind $%^#. I was recommended this film from a chap over at IMDb.com's Film General forum, the topic was "What was the first film to drop the F-Bomb?" While that question may never be definitevely answered, this is surely one of the first. It was a film way ahead of its time.<br/><br/>Today i took the A train down to Columbus Circle and transfered to the B. Dropped me off at Herald Square. Not sure how much time this took, as today i left the cell phone at home. I hate cell phones. It is no wonder so many girls and hipsters use them like security blankets on the streets. They isolate themselves from the strangers surrounding them by attaching themselves to the same people they always talk to. Never bothering to meet new people. I carry mine only because ... i have to. Can't escape everything. What am i running from? The technology that puts food on my table. Crazy, huh?<br/><br/>I'd better get to work.</p>
