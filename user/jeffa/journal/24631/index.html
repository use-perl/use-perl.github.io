<p>Washed me clothes last night! (Exciting!) I only brought a limited amount of belongs with me, including very few clothes. 2 suits, 5 dress shirts, 2 pair of winter pants (?!), and one pair of khakis. I left the khakis in the washer last night and was planning on wearing them today. They will soon be cut into shorts, but for now they are still good enough to wear to work ... perfect to wear to tonight's Rev. Horten Heat show! They were still in the washer downstairs in the basement washroom, but they were wet and unwearable. Lucky for my, my roommate was kind enough to lend me a pair of pants. I didn't want to wear my nice suit pants to the show.<br/><br/>Yesterday was fairly uneventful, but i did hit up Craig's list and "apply" to try-out for a few rock bands. I miss playing after having seen some good local bands play last Friday night (Secret Life of Sophia and Line & Sinker). I played 'Fable' on the XBox for a few hours over my nice bowl of ramen noodles :D Our TV set sucks though ... reception keeps crapping out.<br/><br/>I read an aritcle this morning in 'New York Magazine' about ladies who had surgery to go from 250 pounds to 120 pounds. The cover girl talked about her ex-husband (who left her) ... he was a D&D geek and now she dates some buff, permed gel-head who no doubt is as fake as his appearance. Wonders never cease. I am happy for her new found 'mobility' ... but i feel she is in for a shock when she learns "you can't go home." People can really suck -- especially when they don't know how to ... just be themselves.<br/><br/>Speaking of food ;) ... i had my first Nathan's hot dog yesterday. Not bad! Me and my cow-orker went to the Manhattan mall for lunch, ate there and popped into a Game store to check out the latest titles. I nearly pooped myself when i saw the case for 'GTA: San Andreas' for the XBox. "That's not suppose to be out until June!" ... and it's not. It was just a Pre-order item. Thank God ... but my fate is sealed when that game is released. I tore up 'GTA: Liberty City' and 'Vice City.' <br/><br/>Ramen noodles never tasted so good.</p>
