<div class="span8">
<p>Time to play some catch up.<br/><br/>This past Thursday and Friday were not good coding days for me. I was working on some Krang code that someone who should not have been allowed to write left behind for me to "fix up," and while i don't mind fixing "bad" code, i do mind trying to learn a framework with said bad code. I left the office Thursday with a dark cloud over my head and headed to the gym. Phil gave us one hell of a work out -- since there were less students that night we were allowed to practice with the pads. That means we could kick and punch as hard as we pleased. Afterwards i attended the Jai Yet stretching class and headed over to a Vietnamese restaurant for some of their tasty tasty soup.<br/><br/>Friday day was more of the same at work (but i did get to have lunch with the lovely Marta :)), and that night i met up with sporty and drank some beers over at St. Andrew's pub. Lovely place that lovely place is. Saturday i woke up and decided to go work out after all, so off to the gym i went. Again we were allowed to practice with the pads, and my partner that day has been taking Tai Boxing for 2 years now. He kicked the hell outta my arm! I had some minor bruises from holding the pads for him, but it's all good. After class i wandered up to Astor Place, rented some flicks, and bought a couple of bottles of Aloe Vera (Vera! What has become of you?!?!) juice (mostly grape juice and water though) and got a call from Mike. He wanted to meet at Freddie's in Brooklyn and drink some beers that night. Also wanted me to bring the Xbox so he could jam on some San Andreas. I had just rented 2 flicks so i was unsure that i would be able to make it ... but i said "what the hell" and committed.<br/><br/>Then ... i got a call from Scott, he had just returned from a short vacation in Vegas. He said he was at Union Square, so again i exclaimed "what the hell" and walked on over to meet him. We walked on down to Washington Square and MacDougal over to my new favorite Ethiopian restaurant, Meskerem. On the way he stopped at a stand where a Russian lady was selling Russian T-shirts. Scott speaks a bit of Russion, so they hit it off pretty good. He stops ... i spend $20 on a T-shirt, couldn't resist it though. Off to the restaurant. I still had my gym bag full of stuff and didn't want to bring it into Brooklyn. We walked (in the rain - where'd that come from?) up to the subway station and made it back to Scott's place in the Upper East side. Nice freakin' apartment! Dropped my bags off and we headed out the door. When we entered the elevator, Scott used the opportunity to shock his neighbors inside with an overhearinnewyork.com momment:<br/><br/>"Yeah, i had to cancel my cards because of the hookers."<br/><br/>You see, while he was in Vegas, his "friends" decided (real late one night) to bring some hookers back to the hotel room. Scott was sound asleep and none the wiser. When he awoke the next morning, his discovered his wallet was gone. He rushed down to the front desk and used an Internet kiosk to cancel his cards. He took some cash from his "friends" (he knew the hookers stole his wallet) and then proceeded to try to solve the problem of getting on a plane with no identification whatsoever. About then his "friends" called and said they found his wallet, cards there but minus about $500 bucks. Money that he won at the blackjack table, so he wasn't to upset over loosing it.<br/><br/>"Yeah, i had to cancel my cards because of the hookers."<br/><br/>Man, that's just classic. So ... me and Scott hit the sub and attempted to make it Brooklyn. We crossed the river on the 5 train, but we didn't realize that we hit a "last stop" just into Brooklyn and went all the way back to Penn Station. We finally made it to Brooklyn, Scott had not been to Brooklyn yet. He fell in love with the place -- while he can afford to live in the Upper East Side (of Manhattan) he really doesn't like the neighborhood. We met with Mike and drank a few, and then we were graced with the presence of Mike's girlfriend, Alana. Afterwards we ate some greasy fried chicken and me and Scott headed back to the "City." When we got to Scott's place (at 3am) i decided i should just crash on the living room couch and try to get back in the morning. (Getting from the Upper East Side to Inwood via subway takes FOREVER!).<br/><br/>Sunday morning i awoke, enjoyed the view from that living room, and rode the elevator up to the roof of Scott's apartment building. I enjoyed the view of the City for a short while and headed back down. Stopped off at a nice yet cheap dinner for some French toast, eggs, and bacon, and proceeded down the 6 subway train to my office. I picked up my left over sandwich from a little party that was held Friday and proceeded to get back home -- during Puerto Rico Day!!! It took me about 2 hours to get home. >:(<br/><br/>When i got home i watched the 2 flicks i rented: "Sweet Sweetback's Baad Asssss Song" (thumbs down) and "Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia" (thumbs up), taking a nap between each one. Afterwards, i traveled ALL THE WAY back down the City to drop the videos off. Man, i gotta move closer to the East Village. ;)<br/><br/>I ate Taco Bell Sunday night ... man i just craved that stuff. All those kick ass restaurants in the East Village and i crave Taco Bell. :P<br/><br/>Monday was another "get my ass handed back to me" day at work ... until around 5:30pm when i finally made a breakthrough in the code i was working on.<br/><br/>s/^pem_//;<br/><br/>And suddenly everything works. :) Well ... everything *so far* ...</p>

That's actually a neat idea. Imagine some kind of <a href="http://aosd.net/" title="aosd.net">AOP</a aosd.net> CPAN module that reveals the "wet spots" by dipping your code in "flour"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... sick and tasteless, i know, but still<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... you may be onto something with this.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
