<p>Well Hell's Bells.<br/><br/>All i wanted was an explanation on how a certain method worked in Krang and what i got was endless chastising RTFM comments. Now i've gone and pissed off a rather cool individual who may never talk to me again. <br/><br/>Yes. I hate Krang. Big time. At this point, i'm ready to jump ship over to Java or .NET ... now, i know that is a hyperbole, but goddamit you would think that the Krang mailing list denizens would understand my frustration and level of experience well enough to avoid telling me to just RTFM.<br/><br/>What happens when RTFM just isn't enough? What happens when the documentation you point to is lacking? Everything i pointed out in my Perlmonk's article "How (Not) To Ask A Question" has been violated by me personally ... but is it really me ... or is it really that the documentation in question is so lacking that the folks who cling to RTFM are just abusing their stance?<br/><br/>I am this close to getting results in Krang ... *this* close ... and with little to no thanks from the suggestions given from the mailing list.<br/><br/>People died today in London ... what the hell i am complaining about?</p>

I did not write any of that. And if there are future negative comments about Krang, those were not submitted by me either.
<p>
Those were like, <em>other jeffa's</em>, or something.</p>
