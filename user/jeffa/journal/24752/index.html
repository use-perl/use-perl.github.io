<p>Wild crazy dreams ... i went to bed early last night in hopes being able to last the long day ahead of me. I really want to finish up my current project today (due this Friday) and the perlsemny meeting is tonight. Not to mention my cow-orkers band is playing late tonight and i simply have to see them. My friend had a spare ticket to go see the Doves tonight, but i had already promised to go see my cow-oker's band play.<br/><br/>Last night i watched 'Primer' ... i highly recommend everyone who reads this to check it out. It solves its problems of not exactly making the ends meet with good old obfuscation. Great flick!<br/><br/>Them crazy dreams ... why is it that i have these panick attacks in my dreams? Rhetorical question, but if i can solve that problem, i think most of my social problems would simply go away. Its a test you see ... dealing with lonliness. Most simply confide in a spouse -- they find one, enter a co-dependent relationship, and deal with fixing the symptom, not the problem. Ultimately, i think the problem is about death. Scary, frightening stuff. The major panick attack last night was that i was walking in a circle with a group of people. I wasn't really suppose to be there in the first place, but i was welcome. It was sort of a graduation ceremony, but you know how dreams get all ... fuzzy. While walking, i suddenly found my legs starting to freeze up, and i couldn't walk. I was able to step away from the line, however, and let everyone pass on by. Needless to say, i didn't get to follow to the ceremony, but then again ... i wasn't really suppose to be there in the first place.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was the line to Carrousel, a la "Logan's Run" ... :)</p>

<p>Funny how dreams seem to have recurring themes.</p>

<p>In mine, I am always on my own, there are only one or two persons I deal with directly &#8211; though a crowd of nameless people may be involved in some part of the dream &#8211;, and I do something crazy and bad on an uncontained compulsion, but there are no immediate consequences, and I get ever more anxious as life continues and I try to pretend nothing happened. The dreams usually end or fizzle out before reaching any conclusion; all there ever is is that ever mounting tension and an increasing experience of surreality from the cognitive dissonance between The Deed and the pretense.</p>

<p>I am glad that I don&#8217;t remember my dreams most of the time.</p>

I could only wish that i didn't remember most of my dreams. I consider them a sort of purging of the day's events. Most of mine are harmless, and the ones that are disturbing i am always a spectator, never a direct participator -- although surely i am the "director." It's good to be able to yell "CUT!" and wake up.

<p>Ah. That doesn&#8217;t seem <em>too</em> bad then. Of course, it doesn&#8217;t make any particular disconcerting dream less disconcerting&#8230;</p>
