<p>OK ... there was no freak out. But i did watch 'Vistor Q' last night. I don't recommend that you do, in fact -- stay away. After that i watched the remake of 'Assault on Precinct 13' -- it was a very good take on the original. Hell, it was actually better. The fellow whose room i am subletting while he is away in Arizona is a playright, and he has a lot of great books, mostly classics, in the room. I picked up the play "Closer," because it was short and easy to read. While i didn't really care for the ending, the play was very stylish and one particular line really grabbed my attention:<br/><br/>"Everything is just Version of Something Else."<br/><br/>Looking back on my life, i don't think i've every really come up with one single original idea. Not that it bothers me -- i am an extremely *creative* person. But i never really *create* anything. Being creative is not about being able to create something new, i feel -- it is about being able to produce without having to directly copy something. To be able to improvise or just sit down and concentrate on producing something *from yourself*. We are subjected to so many ideas from our fellow humans that it is next to impossible to not *lift* something -- but when you can *come up* with something without having to cheat, well, that's what i call being creative.<br/><br/>But ... everything is a Version of Something Else. And that's not going to stop me from trying to be original. ;)</p>

<p>Apart from writing your journal in a different way than everybody else around here, right?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

It's bloody near unreadable.<br> <br>Lazy? I don't get it. I just copied your latest journal text in the browser, made a new draft journal entry, pasted it in, selected "plain old text" as the format, and looked at the preview. The page layout was roughly identical to yours, except it used a variable pitch font, complete with automatic wrapping inside the paragraphs.<br> <br>I could even replace your <tt>*create*</tt> with <tt>&lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; </tt>, and it appears as "<em>create</em>". So you get the best of both worlds: easy paragraph formatting, and the option to format emphasized text with HTML tags.<br> <br>What more do you want?<br>

Hah!
<p>
Just gained an XP point at <a href="http://perlmonks.com/" title="perlmonks.com">http://perlmonks.com/</a perlmonks.com> and my quip was, and i quote:
</p>
<tt> You are a unique snowflake.</tt>
<p>
Now <b>that's</b> funny. And looks like i have to spell it out for you bart. This is my journal. When i post my personal comments, i post them in a manner that looks like they were typed by a <em>typewriter</em>. Not to mention, i don't want to bother with markup. Stream of conscious, man<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... dig it? Next you'll be telling me to capitalize my <i>i</i>'s<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... [roll's eyes]
