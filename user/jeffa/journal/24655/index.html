<p>Wore my black suit with white shirt and black tie today. Finally get to have my ID picture made so i don't have to sign in to get in the building every damn day. I had a rough time waking up this morning,  didn't get home till 2am ... my roommate still hasn't washed the sinkful of dishes he left from 2 days ago. I'm going to see how long they stay in there ... i don't cook. Going to the grocery and cooking to save money is so overrated. Nobody thinks about the water (and sometimes electricity) it takes to clean your dishes, not to mention the time spent doing all that. I generally try to eat out cheaply, but last night i splurdged on some Ehiopian food. Me and my friend Mike went to see Reverend Horton Heat last night - his girlfriend bailed on the ticket so i got to go instead. Awesome show. Makes me want to get more tattoos! ... Nah ... one's plenty.<br/><br/>Tonight should be fairly uneventful. I'll probably run down to Kim's Video on the way home and pick up a movie. I've been meaning to see 'Visitor Q' for quite sometime, and the way i could view it back in Nashville was to purchase it. It's great having a good underground video store at my disposal. >:)<br/><br/>Looks like YAPC is out this year ... someday i'll attend. In the meantime, i'll go to the NY Perl Seminar next Wednesday and then check out one of my cow-orker's band, June Fool.<br/><br/>Just another day, and another dollar (that's already been spent).</p>

<i>Going to the grocery and cooking to save money is so overrated.</i>

<p>It actually works, you know?

</p> <p> <i>Nobody thinks about the water (and sometimes electricity) it takes to clean your dishes, not to mention the time spent doing all that.</i>

</p> <p>Regarding costs, yesterday's ingredients costed me less than 4 euros, and plenty of them are still there, and will serve another meal. Eating out in Lisbon, at a decent restaurant, costs over 10 euros for sure, over 5 if you go to a mall.

</p> <p>As for time, what about the time one spends going to the restaurant, waiting for someone else (Devil knows who) to cook the food for you and heading back home again?

</p> <p>Not to mention that at home you can be doing other useful things while you wait for the water to boil or whatever.

</p> <p>And I'm not even talking about how bad it might be for your [insert random internal organ here (1)].

</p> <p>(1) - Do not insert "testicles"...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<tt>Fair enough<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but having washed dishes for a living back the in early 90's, i'd rather pay a little extra for the convenience. Of course, when you add 'health' to the mix, that little extra could add up to colon polyps.<br> <br>Back in Nashville, i would go out for lunch, spend about $7-$10 and only eat half, bring the rest home for supper. Now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... if i had a family, then yeah<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... i would grocer more. But being a single bachelor in a day and age where i work behind a computer instead of on a farm, well<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... it just seems<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... unnatural.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br> <br>But i'm a freak.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D</tt>
