<p>"Got the alarm clock set for seven got the taxi called for nine ..."<br/><br/>After work Friday, i took off to Kim's Underground and purchased 'The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou' ... first DVD purchase since i moved up here. I also rented '24 Hour Party People' and walked on over to my favorite coffee seller (the one where i met David Cross) and purchased a pound of beans. I then proceeded to Sidewalk Cafe (all in the East Village) to see Adi, a girl whom i "interviewed" with for a sublet. Her place was too expensive (more importantly she picked someone else to live there) but she told me to visit her at work sometime. She had apparantly twisted her ankle and was out. I enjoyed a burger and a beer, and was rewarded with a free beer for whatever reason i don't know. I was suppose to meet Scott -- his roommate was throwing a part and i was invited. However, his roommate kinda freaked out him, and he told me it was off. But before that Spencer called and invited me to Teddy's in Brooklyn to hang out with his girl and her friends who were up from Memphis. I drank 3 more beers and about 3 shots of some vodka-grenadine shooter thingy. I met up with Scott back in Manhattan at St. Andrews and he told me all about the "joys" of living with upitty people in the Upper East side. I drank 2 more beers and wandered home. Someone threw up in the subway car i was in, while i was in it. That was gross ... but it was still funny.<br/><br/>I woke up Saturday with a hangover. I stumbled to the grocer and bought some creamer and orange juice. I made coffee, swore i'd never drink that much again and watched '24 Hour Party People.' Damn fine movie. My cow-orker, Cris, invited me to a cook-out in Brooklyn that day, so i went to my new favorite Ethiopian restaurant and ordered some food to make my head feel better. Better i did feel. I wandered on over to Kim's and dropped off the video, then i hit the subway and met my cow-orker at his apartment. There we met another musician, Jessica. Her band plays this Friday, i'll be there if i don't take of to Main this upcoming weekend.<br/><br/>We made it to the cookout and there i met a LOT of musicians, had some great BBQ and munchies, and drank absolutely no beer (i only drank water ... and lots of it). Cris's drummer introduced me to a new band, Don Cabellero and i might be getting a band together with Christiana's (a singer) boyfriend. Forgot his name, but she'll contact me i'm sure. I'd love to start playing again -- it's good for the soul. I met a really hot chick towards the end of the night, but i'm not holding my breath -- besides, the last thing i need so soon is a broken heart, although i think i've gotten over that phase of my life. Hmmm ... maybe not.<br/><br/>Sunday i went to the local breakfast dinner to start the day, and didn't feel like going out. I started to play some GTAIII, but the TV kept going out on me. I took off to check out the Wat Thai Boxing gym in China Town. At $150 a month, i'm hard pressed to justify the money i would spend as a member, but i'm going to go check it out (free class) tomorrow night. The place looks AWESOME and i really need something like that as i approach my middle age. We'll see. After that, i found a good Vietnamese Pho restaurant and had a bowl. I called Chris Jackson and found out he and Kat were in Boston. They should be in Maine today for a week's vacation and i might join them this weekend -- never been to Maine before. I walked around Chinatown and into Little Italy, and the rain started so i popped into a litte cafe. I ordered 2 espressos, but drank 3. Woah! BaZING!! <br/><br/>I walked on over to Kim's underground again and purchased Chappelle's show season 2 and "Peeping Tom," an old Powell film that was quite controversial back in its day. I watched the first half last night and while i'm not sure if it was the cause, i had a rather disturbing dream early in the night -- one i'd just rather forget. I usually have such dreams early in the morning, as if my body is telling my brain to wake up dammit! Enough of that. ;) Before i went to sleep i called the girl i talked to at the party Saturday. As usually, such calls are awkward for me, but we might just meet up this weekend if possible. I may be going out of town and not only is Cris's band playing, so is Jessica's. <br/><br/>And now ... back to work. Thank you Perl! <br/><br/></p>
