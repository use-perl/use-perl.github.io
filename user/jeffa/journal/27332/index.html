<p>What? You're *still* here?<br/><br/>I left off quite a few months ago. Since then, i've moved to 3 other locations, the third being my semi-permanent abode. As permanent as any 1 year lease, i suppose. <br/><br/>I left the sublet in Inwood to live at my friend's girlfriend's place ... she took off to Argentina for a month. That was in the Bed-Sty/Clinton Area -- kinda ghetto, but safe enough. The roads were dillapitated and garbage was strewn about, but the people were nice. About 10-15 years ago i probably would have gotten shot.<br/><br/>After that, i found a place in Cobble Hill/Carrol Gardens. I had 5 roommates, but there was plenty of room. That was great until the lady who owned the house returned with her 2 year old daughter who liked to pee on the floor. One by one, all my roommates left. I finally found the place i am at now, and it only cost me $6200 to move in.<br/><br/>JEEBUS!<br/><br/>I moved into Park Slope on October 1st and i really love it there. I usually see the Brooklyn Bridge and the Statue of Liberty from the subway train as it crosses the Manhattan Bridge every day on the way to work, as well as walk past the base of the Empire State Building.<br/><br/>Since we last spoke ... i flew back to the South East (Atlanta and Nashville) and played a show with my old band, Big Vessel (God, i hate that name) and auditioned for a band back here in New York.<br/><br/>I still don't have a home computer or Internet connection. :(<br/><br/>Or a girlfriend. :(<br/><br/>But ... i have this handy corn cob pipe. And i sure do look cool with it. ;)<br/><br/>Any day now ... any day ...</p>
