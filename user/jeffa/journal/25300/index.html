<div class="span8">
<p>I've been reading Neil Peart's "Ghost Rider" and i always get a chuckle when he mentions "kill them all!" ... talking about tourists and other worthless humans that he encountered on his travels. Where am i going with this? It's just me getting some stress off my chest about my quirky roommates. Nice people, but they kinda suck. No personalities ... i wonder why they are even in NYC? Last night i watched "The Machinist" with Christian Bale ... the whole time one of my roommates was making supper, eating supper, and washing the dishes -- oh, and reading the paper. He seemed disgusted that i was watching a movie -- a movie that seemed extremely disturbing, but really wasn't. Anyways, i tried to strike up a conversation with him after the movie was over (he had just finished reading some article so it seemed like a good time). He just sort of shallowly nodded and looked for another article to read.<br/><br/>"You aren't much of movie buff, are you?" I asked.<br/><br/>I love being controversial. Anyhoo ... i tuckered off to bed right about then (10pm) and slept quite soundly. This morning i discovered that my other roommate (the one whose room is really and open space next to the kitchen -- can't be too loud!) and his girlfriend were asleep. Great! Now i have to walk on eggshells and not make too much noise ... nah, screw them! You see, for the most part he is gone all week long. And when he is in town, he stays over at *her* pad. WTF were they doing here this morning? They know me and the other roommate (non-movie buff) wake up early and make noise. So what do i do? That's right ... crank up the "GTA3: San Andreas" on the XBox. She hates that game. Hell -- she hates NYC and America in general. So off i go to take over a new piece of territory for my gang. <br/><br/>RAT-TAT-TAT!<br/><br/>He comes in. "Can you turn that down?" <br/><br/>"Not really."<br/><br/>RAT-TAT-TAT!<br/><br/>It's fun being jeffa. >:)<br/><br/>Anyhoo ... i'm suppose to be out of there July 15th. It's a nice apartment. It's a decent enough neighborhood. It's too far away from the "action." And my roommates are zombies.<br/><br/>The good news is that the Krang project here at work is coming along much better. Last week was kinda rough ... nowhere near as rough as my "last" job in Nashville, but still ... i was cursing in the dark. Friday after work i took off to buy tickets for the VNV Nation show at Irving Plaza. I stopped at a nice little bar next door and drank a couple of Gin and tonics, while i waited for Mike and Scott to show up. We took off to an Italian restaurant (which i swore that i had never been to before even though Mike assured me i had ... he was right) and drank a bottle of wine and ate some damned good food. Off to the Punk Rock Tiki bar for some beers and then <br/><br/>BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM<br/><br/>Great show. I think i spent about $120 that night. Yikes!<br/><br/>Needless to say ... i'm taking it easy this week.</p>

I hear you, although I'm not sure how you can call the person reading and doing the dishes a zombie, while you watching a movie is a non-zombie activity.

It's about the <em>mind</em> man<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... the <em>mind</em>!
<p>
The whole time he was doing his rote activity, there was no expression on his face. Meanwhile, i'm beaming with excitement and fascination over a <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0361862" title="imdb.com">movie</a imdb.com>. Get it?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I had a good talk with the first roommate i mentioned. He's not a zombie in the least. I had no idea that he was upset with the <em>other</em> rommmate and his girlfriend as well. The good news is that i don't have to kill him<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D
<p>
The bad news is<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... hmmm<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... there is no bad news!
