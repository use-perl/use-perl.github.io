<p>Is it me, or is this winter hanging on too long? It's nice to be able to wear a trenchcoat and all, but i'm ready for some summer beaches.<br/><br/>Krang kicked my butt yesterday. Rather, this script that uses Krang outside the webserver is kicking my butt ... then again, i would have written it completely different. One shouldn't have to parse class hierarchies as such:<br/><br/>#########################################
my $name = $class->name;<br/><br/>if ($name eq 'this') {
   # do something
}
elsif ($name eq 'that') {
   # do something completely different
}
elsif ... yadda yadda
#########################################<br/><br/>Something is very fishy about code like that ... "path of least resistance."<br/><br/>Nothing particularly exciting happened after work last night. I stopped by K-Mart and bought some undergarments and then off to Kim's to purchase Criterion's "F Is Fake" (Orson Wells) and finally off to M2M to purchase some Oriental groceries. The A train was a mess last night. Bunch of screaming kids and screaming parents. Good thing i have my little MP3 player ... but still ... SHUT THE HELL UP!! ;)<br/><br/>I started playing Thief 3 again last night. That game was the whole reason i bought an Xbox. Man i love that game. I'll do some laundry tonight, eat some gourmet ramen noodles (bought from M2M) and play some Thief 3.<br/><br/>Or i might do some laundry and take off to Death Disco at the Delancy ... nothing like free rock shows! (But the beer ain't free ...)</p>

Now for the silly part. I saw somewhere this week a study that tracked animal movements and habit schedules. Theyh were all early.<br> <br>Now for an early spring, we're sure having a very late summer.
