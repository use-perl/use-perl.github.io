<p>I had a nightmare this morning. First one i've had in long time. I dreamt that i was back home, in Murfreesboro. All i wanted to do was get back to New York. Sometimes i still wonder how i got here -- it's only been 2 weeks, but the thought of being anywhere else seems ... well, just awful. In the dream, i was back at my parents 'old' house, not their new one -- the new one that i stayed at for 1 week before i moved up here on Tuesay, April 26th. In the dream, i was either in that state just prior to moving up here, or it was a semi- future event where i will fly back home, retrieve the rest of my belongings, and drive 'em up in a van. Either way, i won't be flying back ... which is why it was so odd that in the dream, i couldn't find my plane ticket ... and panicked.<br/><br/>Actually, it was a great way to start the week ... when i awoke, i was sooo happy to be in New York.<br/><br/>This is my second week at the new job, and so far so good. Solved a couple of bugs last week, got some paper work out the way, and completed 50% of a new feature i was tasked to add. I mostly puttered around the Net ... but only because i don't have my computers up here with me. This is really the only time i am online, at work. I'll have my folks ship the 'puter up.<br/><br/>This week (and next) is ramen noodle week. I only have about $200 in the bank account, and veritable $hit ton of credit card debt. I can hold out for the next two weeks until my first paycheck ... i just have to go straight home after work and play some XBox, the reason why i brought it with me. It was easier to carry than a computer. (Why didn't i buy a laptop last year instead of that stupid tower?!?)<br/><br/>Last Thursday i met Sam Tregar, Perrin Hawkins, and Michael Peters. Perrin took us all out for some really nice food at a 'Frenchy' restaurant called the Blue Light. Thanks again Perrin! That was the first time i met (in person) Perrin and Sam, and i had not seen Mike in well over a year. He and i had a Parallel Processing class together, my last semester as a grad student at MTSU. The school that is every bit my second home as it is my major source of debt. (Why oh why didn't i take the *blue* pill?)<br/><br/>Well, for better or worse ... i am in New York now.<br/><br/>jeffa is dead. Long live jeffa.</p>

<h2>X-Box Linux</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/perrin/">perrin</a> on 2005-05-09T18:36:08</h3>
Time to get that X-Box Linux distro going!<p>
There actually are many inexpensive activities in New York.  Check around on the net or look through a copy of <i>Time Out</i> for starters.</p> <p>
By the way, the restaurant is actually called "Blue Ribbon", and Sam split the bill with me.  Welcome to NYC.  See you soon.</p>

<h2>Mmmmm... ramen noodles!</h2>

Congrats on making the big apple, jeffa!<br> <br>But I think that "The Blue Light" is actually the name of the cafeteria in KMart stores.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;^)
