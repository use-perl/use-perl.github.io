<p>... go to bed at 4am in the morning ... and you are lucky to wake up before noon. I got up around 8:30 ... made it to work at 10pm. Needless to say, i'll be staying till about 6 or 7pm tonight. Unless i just really knock out some logic today.<br/><br/>Last night was a blast, but i was quite sad by the time i made it home. It was past my bedtime and i was sooo ready to go to bed. Sleep, not sex -- although i did talk to some cute girls last night. Wouldn't know what to do with the fish if i caught it anyways. <br/><br/>The night started off with listening to Intrepid make a fool of himself on Perlmonks. I even /borg'ed him ... first time i've ever sicked the NodeReaper on anyone besides myself. (I do love to play the "Evil Clown.") I hurried off to Sapporo's for a nice dinner of Sukuyaki and beer with my friend Mike. He had not sold his ticket for Doves/Mercury Rev show, and seeing as how i missed the PerlSymNY meeting due to thinking it was last night ... i bought his extra ticket ($35). Glad i did. Both bands were incredible -- i'll be buying some of their CD's soon. Before the Doves started playing, however, i had another one of those dudes that brings his girl to the show, and then proceedes to suck the energy from everyone around him and lavish it on her. There was a hole in fron of me, and they filled it. They had plenty of room to fill it, yet there was his arm in my chest. I tapped him on the shoulder, looked him evilly in his eye and politely asked "Could you please move forward?" He looked disappointed that someone would actually tell him to do something. I could see "How dare you?" form in his mind, but i never blinked ... and he moved forward. Then the band started with "Stomp" ... and pogo did he. He kept pushing back, thinking i would succomb and give him the space he so did not deserve. Instead, i pushed into him. I yawped and clapped as hard as i could ... right in his ear. That prick who probably bought his ticket for $100 (it was a sold out show and my buddy Mike knows how to buy online) finally got the message and he and his girlfriend shot off forward into the crowd. I waved my hand right behind his head as scurried away. Sure, he probably could have kicked my ass ... but that's not the point. Stand up for yourself. Do not let the pricks have their way. Besides, the Doves are a Manchester band. You don't suck energy from a Manchester band ... you give it back.<br/><br/>My cow-owrker's band (June Fool) was suppose to start at 11:15pm at the Delancy. The Doves would not finish until 11:15pm. I had to leave during their last song, regretfully. Mike told me to take a cab. It was the first cab i have taken by myself in the City, and i could care less if i ever take another one again. I'd rather walk. I made it to the Delancy at 11:00pm ... but Cris (my cow-orker) and his bandmates got screwed. They wouldn't go on until 2am in the morning. That would have been fine with me had the band before them not completely sucked. They were good musicians, they were probably nice people (well, except the chick singer -- rude), they were tight, they were on key ... their music was just ... they just didn't get it! These are the people who shouldn't be making music. June Fool however, was damn good. Very moody stuff. I'm kinda glad i made it at 11pm because i did get to catch the band, Air Guitar Magazine. What a hoot they were! Bass, drums, and two trumpet players. They passed out blow-up floater guitars and let the audience convulse with them. The band members wore silly costumes and played even sillier music. It was, as host BP Fallon himself said ... f'in brilliant!<br/><br/>I met an interesting chap at the show. He reminded me of Alex Ogburn, an ex-bandmate of mine. "A++ type" personality ... has to have everyone's attention. He kept trying to hook me up with some of the cute girls at the show, but i was just too self-contained to even try and socialize with bar-girls. They aren't my type anyway ... they smoke cigarettes. I hate cigarette smoke. That knocks out about 85% of the girls that show up to clubs, and the remaining 15% have steady boyfriends. Oh well ... i only show up to the shows to see the bands and more importantly ... hear the music. I am a musician, not a player. Girls at clubs are only good for one night stands and those pricks in the 70's ruined for everyone. Got protection?<br/><br/>Time for work ... gotta earn my keep.</p>

I play hockey with Jimy Chambers, who was a Mercury Rev band member many years ago. I don't think he plays with them any more, not live at least. Glad to hear their shows are still good. I need to get some of their CDs. Wait, the iTunes store has some of their stuff...cool.
