<p>Ahhh, nothing like entering the A train and finding a smelly homeless guy, carrying his own excrement and what not in buckets with him. I sat down to his left, across the barrier, doors, and another barrier  ... and watched my fellow locals recoil in horror as they entered the train. I could have walked to another car, but i thought i'd "be a man" and take it ... all the way from 200th down to 34th. I couldn't help but wonder if the poor man could feel the hate and negative energy directed toward him from everyone else. <br/><br/>Yesterday on the way home i sat down next to nice, young, good looking lady. I noticed she was reading a copy of 'New York Magazine' and i struck up a conversation: "Is this month's edition any good?"<br/><br/>She said it was alright, she bought it to read the cover story. I explained that the girl whose room i took over (for my sublet) decided to cancel her subscription after reading an article in last month's about 'I Hate Brooklyn' ... where she just moved to. "Pretentious bull$hit!" she cried. I read the article, and really didn't know what to think, other than the author had some good points, but seemed more interested in stroking his own ego.<br/><br/>Anyways ... the nice lady on the subway explained that to live in NYC, you simply cannot be over-sensitive. Today was a great example of that ... smelly man. I just breathed ever so lightly through my nose and tried not to swallow. Across from me sat a man who yawned at least 3 times. Not a good idea. I feel sorry for whomever sat down in that spot the smelly man was sitting in 5 minutes after he got off the train. Hell, he's probably still there ...<br/><br/>Last night i watched 'Network' and 'Serpico' ... two movies directed by Sidney Lumet that take place in NYC in the 70's. My how times have changed. I feel that most of the rest of the country feels that NYC is still that way. Oh well ... that's probably for the better as 10 million people fill this city up enough as it is.<br/><br/>And yes, i had ramen noodles for supper last night. ;)</p>
