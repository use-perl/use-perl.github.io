<p>Eek. A girl passed out on the A Train this morning, not 10 feet from me. The train stopped in the tunnel, probably waiting for the Columbus Circle traffic to clear up, and just before we got to said stop someone yelled for a doctor. I hope she is alright, she probably just fainted. Another A Train came down the other track i was able to make it to my stop without too much delay. I walked from Penn Station today, and picked up a banana for a quarter at a stand. Some lady was looking at the bananas saying "None of these look good." They did. I told the vender that they looked just fine.<br/><br/>Last night i checked out the original version of the fourth Excorcist movie, 'Dominion.' This is the version that the studios shunned because it was too cerebral and not appealing to dumb teenagers. It was much, much better, but nowhere near as good as the original. I knew it wouldn't be, but i was very interested in seeing with my own two eyes what i know in my heart: business men have no clue about art, and can't just let go and let the marketing people do their job. This version would have done just as well at the box office, if not better. Serves 'em right.<br/><br/>I was going to check out the Wat gym tonight (Thai Boxing) but i'll go Thursday instead. Need to buy gym clothes and stuff and do some laundry before hand. Maybe someday i'll check out the new Star Wars, but i'm really just not in a hurry to do so.<br/><br/>And now, it is time to delve into Krang. >:)
