<p>The only regret i have from this past weekend was spending $50 on 2 frickin' rolls of sushi at a posh rip-off joint: Neo Sushi. What the hell was i thinking? It was good. It was really good, but it was just too damned expensive. Especially when i looked at the bill and discovered that the pot of green tea costs $6. Six dollars! That's when i realized that they were charging way too much ... and i just will not ever go back there again.<br/><br/>It was good though ...<br/><br/>Before i blew that considerable wad of money, i did go see 'Layer Cake' ... excellent movie. Some lady who sitting to my right constantly "mmm-hmm"'ed the whole movie. A fellow in front of us finally turned around and politely told her to shut up. Saved me the trouble. ;)<br/><br/>Good movie though ...<br/><br/>I watched my copy of 'F for Fake' last night, excellent stuff. And i finished 'Life Aquatic w/ Steve Zissou' -- another winner from Wes Anderson. I did go out Sunday and see my cow-orkers band play, but i stayed in pretty much all day yesterday.<br/><br/>Random just made up quote: "People walk in NYC like people in TN drive." A person can push through people though, a car cannot muscle its way through other cars without suffering severe body damage. Plus, a honking horn doesn't sound as forgiving as "excuse me."<br/><br/>Tonight i finally start working out at the Thai boxing gym. I'll let you know how it goes. It's just beginners' stuff tonight, so nothing special. Just a work out, and boy do i ever need that.<br/><br/>Big thanks to samtregar and perrin for confirming that i am not insane and this Krang utility script i am modifying was poorly written. As eduardo stated ... "how about we use the tool designed to do this to... you know... do this." Amen, bro.</p>

Oh yeah<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... status update on the workout: i can't move my legs. I signed up for a year. Looks like Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday are my "jeffa gets his ass kicked" days.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br/><br/><a href="http://thewat.com/" title="thewat.com">http://thewat.com/</a thewat.com>
