<h1>ParTcl: Dynamic Tcl PMCs</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>A few months ago, I put together a cargo cult version of basic PMC types for
Tcl based on their Perl counterparts. I ripped out all reference to PerlUndef,
and made sure the shimmering (automatic conversion of datatypes) was working between the various types.
<br><br>
After posting this to the list, I was told that this was good, but these PMCs
needed to be dynamic. That is, rather than being types that are shipped with
the basic parrot core, they should be available as a dynamically loadable
library. Makes sense. (Note: This also means that <B>Perl's</b> PMCs should also
be moved to a dynamic library, especially now that parrot has its own,
non-Perl base types.).
<br><br>
Things sat for a bit after that. Thanks to Mattia Barbon who provided a way to group related pmcs together into a single library to load (Before this, interrelated
pmcs were uncompilable, as each depended on another that hadn't been compiled yet.). Also thanks to Steve Fink, who got <b>that</b> working under OS X, which
is my primary development environment.
<br><br>
Now, if you <pre>cd dynclasses && make</pre> you get <code>runtime/parrot/dynext/tclgroup.so</code> (or something like it.) (If you don't, there's a bug, and please report it
to the perl6 internals list. )
<br><br>
Now, at the top level parrot directory, you can create <code>foo.imc</code> containing:
<br>
<pre>
.sub main
  loadlib $P0, "tclgroup"    # Load combined tcl lib
  $I0 = find_type "TclInt"   # Find ID for a TclInt *
  $P0 = new $I0              # Instantiate
  $P0 = "asdf"               # Assign
  print $P0
  print "\n"
  $S0 = typeof $P0           # Get the type description.
  print $S0
  print "\n"
  end
.end
</pre>
This snippet prints out <pre>asdf
TclString</pre> Note that the type of the PMC has
shimmered (morphed, if you prefer) to the appropriate data type. I need to do
more work to nail down the appropriate reactions for each kind of shimmer for
Tcl.
  <br><br>
Next steps:
 <ol> 
<li> Remove any dependence in Tcl's PIR on the Perl* PMCs.</li>
<li>Provide the ability to generate Tcl Lists from within Tcl<br>
(that is, write [list]), and insure that the right thing happens when shimmering between a list and a string. For example, insure that:
<pre>
puts '[string range [list 1 2 3] 0 2]'
</pre>
Actually generates
<pre>
'1 2'
</pre>
which will have been shimmered from a TclList (returned by [list]) to a TclString
</li>
</ol>
<br><br><i>
<a name="footnote">[*] - these steps are, of course, unnecessary with built in types. They're
necessary here because when parrot started, we didn't know anything about Tcl.
We have to load the pmcs, and then, because the pmc types were created at
runtime, we have to use a runtime check to get our class ID. (As opposed to
the builtin type <code>String</code>, which you can, thanks to <code>runtime/parrot/include/pmctypes.pasm</code>, just create with <code>$P0 = new String</code>)</a></i></p>
