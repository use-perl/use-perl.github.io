<p>I've not had much time the past few weeks to work on partcl, as I've a major work deadline that ended up going long.<br/><br/>But, that's alright, because Matt Diephouse has been fixing quite a few things up; Alberto SimÃÂµes has picked up some PIR and begun fleshing out all the missing [string] subcommands (Yay!), and we got  a commit from Bernhard Schmalhofer enabling us to have a test_like variant for our suite, giving us another passing test!<br/><br/>So, with no commits by me, we've increased our passing rate of the tcl test suite by nearly 100 tests in two days. At this rate, 
we'll have a fully functional version of tcl in 307 days. ^_^<br/><br/>Robert Spier posted some preliminary yearly stats to parrot, which show me as the #2 contributor this year (behind Leo), and #3 the year before that (behind leo and dan): Leo and I are the only two on the top 10 two years running. Which might explain why...<br/><br/>We also got a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_thread/thread/36dcd64c311bc90f/52f23649ce9e7804?lnk=st&q=larry+wall+tcl+parrot+group%3Aperl.perl6.language&rnum=1&hl=en#52f23649ce9e7804">mention by Larry Wall</a>:<br/><br/><blockquote>
Likewise Parrot is targeting Perl as its "first" language, but if you 
look at recent history you'd think they were mainly targeting TCL. 
And that's fine by us, both officially and unofficially. 
</blockquote><br/><br/>
Current stats with the converted tcl suite: 5.28%.<br/><br/>This is lower than the last reported percentage, because:<br/><br/>1) I'm not skipping [clock] anymore (7568 tests out of 16210!)
2) we've lost a bit of ground on some tests because of internal changes in the past year (including -> compiler). But, given these reorgs, we seem to be gaining passing tests now faster than we have in the past.<br/><br/>Also, 5.28% is pretty good when I think about trying to figure out how much of Perl6 is working on parrot. At least I have a known test suite to run against.<br/><br/>On the short list coming up are namespaces (Chip? 'allo?), and some developer support for generating builtins using our compiler that should simplify things and allow us to start doing more, more quickly.<br/><br/>Thanks to all the folks that have been working on partcl!</p>
