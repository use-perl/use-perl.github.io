<p>...it's past midnight (Arizona time at least).  Bit of a busy weekend, phew.<br/><br/>You know you've neglected use.perl.org when you <b>finally</b> get to have a proper browse and you realize you've got a plethora of un-read journal entries (not including comments - although most of those are made up of the almost mandatory <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/">pudge</a> - <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/autarch/">autarch</a>  arguments - well at least <b>someone</b> is filling in for <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/hfb/">hfb</a> now that she's <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/hfb/journal/3117">moved on</a>)<br/><br/>Along with buying some more fish for the ol' saltwater tank I <b>finally</b> got around to buying "Object Oriented Perl" by Mr Conway.  My wife and I spent a good 4 hours in Borders today.<br/><br/>Well, it's rather late.  I've obviously got some catching up to do with journals - perhaps tomorrow I'll give them all a good read.  For now, I wish all a goodnight...</p>

Most of the comments have not come from autarch and me.  It only seems that way.  Unless you count actual bytecount instead of comment count, then, perhaps.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>I'm going cold turkey</h2>

I've realized that these arguments are:<br> <br>1. Boring for me.<br>2. Probably boring for others.<br>3. Too downright annoying for me.<br>4. Not achieving anything since I have no chance of changing Pudge's mind.<br> <br>Contrary to what it appears, I don't get off on arguing for the sake of arguing (though I _am_ easily baited<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;).<br> <br>Basically, I argue with people in order to try to change their mind and achieve some goal I want to see achieved (animal rights, progressive policies, etc.).<br> <br>If someone is completely inimical to those things I think it's best to cut my losses and just move on to greener pastures.  After all, I only have a certain number of hours per day to do all the things I want so I should probably save my arguing time/energy for more likely targets<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

I don't believe it is boring for you, as you get way to into it.  But that's neither here nor there, I suppose.<br> <br>Meanwhile, I argue to expand horizons (my own and others), not to convince anyone that I my views are correct.  This is why I tried to help you fix logical problems in your arguments, without attacking you or your views over them, because I am more interested in honest debate leading to understanding than beating you in a game or even convicing you that you're wrong.<br> <br>I believe understanding and acceptance of each other is key to a good world to live in, because we are far too different to ever be the same, and we are far too uncivilized to accept differences in each other without understanding each other.<br>
