<p>Funny.  <a href="http://www.ddj.com">Dr. Dobb's Journal</a> has an interesting little blurb on Slashdot whereby Michael Swaine basically hails all things <a href="http://slashcode.com>SLASH</a>.  He then (in a separate article) predicts <i>dire consequences</i> and general doom & gloom for Slashdot based on the new pay-to-avoid-ads model.  I don't necessarily think people will leave Slashdot in droves as he predicts but I must say that one of the points he raised had me nodding my head in agreement:<br/><br/><i>...Slashdot acquires its content for free from it's readers, and the culling of that content is also supplied by the readers - so why should they pay for the product of their own efforts?</i></p>

Slashdot have themselves in a tough spot. They're basically over-staffed, in my (admittedly 10,000 miles away) view.<br> <br>From what I can tell, they've got 2 full time story editors. At least one fully paid writer (Katz). A managing editor. Several network admins. Sales people. Two full time developers. And possibly more.<br> <br>I can't see how they can possibly generate enough revenue from ads for so many staff, and still pay for bandwidth off the top of that. Well actually we know that they're not...<br> <br>Secondly, the new ads don't seem to be intrusive enough. I haven't had any trouble just scrolling past them. If they were full-page ads, with "click to get to the comments" then maybe it would be quite different.<br> <br>But yeah, I agree - I mean if CmdrTaco went out looking for news, and actually posted grammatically correct and interesting stories with original content, then maybe people wouldn't feel so bad about paying for it. But as it is, I can't see people being too chuffed about having to pay for stuff they basically submitted themselves.

What is the need for Katz? I don't think he writes all that well (especially his movie reviews). He does probably bring up a lot of page-views since a lot of folks on<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/. despise him, I just think they should stop paying him.<br> <br>It does look like some decisions need to be made concerning staff. I would think bandwidth and sysadmins should be at the top of the list. Everything else should be looked at with a cold, hard eye towards the bottom line. But that's from a<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/. regular<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Hey man<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... say what you want, but don't say that Slashdot is overstaffed.  I have a family to feed.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

I happen to believe you're more important to it than Taco.

<h2>Paying for Slashdot</h2>

No one is paying to read Slashdot.  That's a misconception that a lot of people seem to have, for reasons I cannot comprehend.  Slashdot is free to read, it always has been, and there are no plans at all for that to ever change.<br>
