<p>I'm not quite sure <b>what</b> it is about the Olympics this year.  For some reason I think I'm <b>totally</b> addicted.  I absolutely cannot get enough of it.  I find myself watching even the crap events.  Last night was dead exciting, the speed skating was really good- I'd never really got into that event before but I'm hooked now! <br/><br/>The latest Six Nations Rugby tape should be on it's merry way across the pond as we speak.  Actually, I do hope either my Mum or my Sister taped it for me like they said they would.  I can't wait - I'm a self-confessed Rugby addict too!  I had a fun time explaining the rules to my wife and even she likes to watch it now (previously I had been banished into the other room to watch Rugby tapes).</p>

<h2>Salt Lake Olympiad</h2>

What do you find so addictive about the Olympics this year?  I'm finding them completely boring, and we've started buying DVDs to make up for the lack of interesting background noise on network TV this fortnight.  (Now is a good time to watch the entire run of The Prisoner, The Sopranos, or other such compilations...)
<p>
I will admit that the roller derby on ice (er, short track speedskating) is exciting.  Half-pipe was sorta nice, but the camera angles were all wrong (overhead shots would be really nice, instead of the constant switch between left/right/center).  Most of the other events seem to be periodic updates that are intended to distract from the only news coming from the olympic village: how the Canadians were robbed of the Gold for the interpretive-dancing-on-ice competition.  I don't know <i>how</i> they'll be able to televise some of the nordic sports like biathalon (about as exciting as cross country skiing and sport fishing rolled into one, except with rifles; great sport with lots of athletic skill required, but not exciting cannot-look-away television).
</p><p><nobr> <wbr></nobr><i>...waiting with baited breath for the big-marbles-with-brooms-on-ice competition...</i></p>

Dude, curling and hockey and skiing and ski jumpking and biathlon and speed skating are all great.  I find the most boring ones to be, along with figure skating, halfpipe and short-track speed skating, but still, there's a ton to like.
<br>
<br>And I just skip most of the stuff about how France stole the gold from Canada, since I record every Olympic event on the TiVo and skip all that junk.  I've not found any death of things to watch, especially with all the hockey<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... and the good hockey hasn't even started yet!

<i> <b>Curling</b> </i> is really an Olympic event?  I thought someone was yanking my chain.
<p>
As soon as they add <i> <b>bowling</b> </i> to the summer Olympics, I'll start training (201 average here, last time I was in a league).  I guess that entails drinking more beer and bowling 9 games a week instead of 3.  Ooooh...rough.
</p><p>
Now <b> <i>duckpin bowling</i> </b> would be a greater challenge.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I agree curling shouldn't be an Olympic event.  However, that doesn't mean I can't enjoy watching it.

<i>What do you find so addictive about the Olympics this year?</i>
<br>
<br>The speed skating rocks, especially last night's short track.  I also like both the Slalom and Downhill Skiing.  Don't care much for the "slacker" events - halfpipe, moguls etc (grin).  And for some reason I really got into the Skijumping.  I really wanted that Harry Potter bloke to win (if you don't know what I mean, look at him with his hair down and glasses on) - and he did, which was nice<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
<br>
<br> <i>Now is a good time to watch the entire run of The Prisoner, The Sopranos...</i>
<br>
<br>The Prisoner - no, not a big fan.  The Sopranos on the other hand, now I could watch <b>that</b> all day, it's one of the few decent TV shows I'll watch (along with X-Files, West Wing, ER).
<br>
<br>As for the <i>big-marbles-with-brooms-on-ice competition</i> NBC had a teeny little explanation on what the hell those blokes are doing with their brooms and it makes sense now.  Still don't know why anyone would want to watch it but at least I know what the bloody brooms are for<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>The Six Nations of the Iroquois League?  I thought lacrosse was their game, not rugby.  Altho there is something very Mohawk and aggro about guys just beating the crap out of eachother in rugby.</p>

<br>
<br>Er, no, that would be the Six Nations that compete annually in the the imaginatively titled 'Six Nations' Rugby championship.
<br>
<br>Said Six Nations are:
<br>
<br>England
<br>France
<br>Ireland
<br>Italy
<br>Scotland
<br>Wales
<br>
<br>Before Italy joined a few years back the tournament was imaginatively called (yep, you guessed it) the 'Five Nations' championship<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
