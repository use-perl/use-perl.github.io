<p>So I've finally got around to reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  Must be one of the few people on the planet that <b>hasn't</b> read it yet.  Come to think of it, I haven't read LOTR either.  Well as long as I get them both read before the films come out on DVD I'll be happy.</p>

Sorry, but I've still got 2 C.S. Lewis books yet to go.
<p>
As for LOTR, definitely worth the read (probably should read The Hobbit first, though it's not necessary).
</p><p>
Once you've read LOTR, you can also say you've read Terry Brook's <i>Sword of Shannara</i> because, hey, same book.</p>

I've never read anything Harry Potter, and don't plan to.
<br>
<br>I've read the Hobbit, but thought it sucked (when I was 12).  I read FotR and loved it (just finished it).  I'll read the rest of them.
<br>
<br>I've not read the Narnia Chronicles in many years.  I only really liked two of them, the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, and the Magician's Nephew.  But again, that was many years ago.

<br>
<br>Yep, been a few years for me also.  The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was a classic.  I also liked The Silver Chair and The Last Battle (as I recall).

<p>Whilst I loved the Narnia stories (particularly <i>The Silver Chair</i>[1] and <i>The Magician's Nephew</i>) I think I prefered Lewis' other series <i>Out of the Silent Planet</i>, <i>Perelandra</i> and <i>That Hideous Strength</i>.</p>
<br> <p>[1] I have great memories of Tom Baker playing Puddleglum the Marsh Wriggle in the BBC adaptation.</p>

Ahh, the Space Trilogy.  <em>That Hideous Strength</em> is indeed one of my favorites.  (A couple of Neil Gaiman things remind me of it -- "Murder Mysteries", for one.)
<p>
Anybody think Zelazny's Amber chronicles were better stories than Harry Potter?</p>

I attempted <i>The Hobbit</i> when I was around 12 - 15, but gave up.  I'm currently reading LoTR and am really digging it.
<p>
I seem to recall going through all of the Narnia stuff when I was younger.
</p><p>
(My wife read the <i>entire</i> Harry Potter series in something like 2 weeks.  She couldn't put it down, and the family almost starved.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>

I've read all the C.S. Lewis books.  I got about half way through The Hobbit and then bailed.  That was a few years back and you'd think with all the LOTR hype recently I would have picked it back up and tried - alas no.  Thanks for mentioning that it's not necessary to have read The Hobbit to understand what is going on in LOTR - I was wondering that actually.
