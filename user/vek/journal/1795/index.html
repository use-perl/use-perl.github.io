<p>No matter how many years I live here in the states I will <b>not</b> get used to working on bloody boxing day.  It's just not right.  Mental note to self - save one of those oh so precious holiday[1] (vacation) day's for Boxing day.<br/><br/>[1] They don't like to give you much time off in corporate America - it's not like England that's for sure.  Last week my sister had the nerve to complain about not having enough time off - the bloody cheek of it (grin) - I told her that she should come and work in America to <b>really</b> see what not having much holiday is like.</p>

<p>Or so the pilgrims thought anyway. In western Europe your life is something you have along with work, in America your life is your work. 2 weeks of holiday is standard in the US and sometimes you get more than that if you have 5+ years of tenure at a company. I used to have 4 at the university but only 1 week after working a full year at another place. Of course, you could work for HP and take the week between xmas and new year's as an unpaid holiday. The problem with having time off from work is that the more they give you the more you want<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I have like two weeks of vacation a year and never use it.  Of course, that is going to change soon<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<br>
<br>And how true is <b>that</b> statement!  Next year I'm up to 5 years tenure so I'll get an extra couple of days or so - yippee.

<h2>I envy the Europeans for this.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ct/">ct</a> on 2001-12-26T19:14:59</h3>
On #axkit IRC last week I mentioned that I envied the european four weeks vacation. <a href="http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=display&amp;uid=1316" title="perl.org">Robin</a perl.org> laughed at me. <p>"ONLY FOUR WEEKS?!?!".</p><p>
<i>sigh...</i> </p><p>
(He also went on to talk about how many French workers could elect to trade hours per week for vacation. Most worked like 35 a week with four weeks vacation, but some chose to work more hours in exchage for much more.)</p>
