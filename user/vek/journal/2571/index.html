<p>There are some unfortunate side-effects from the tightening of our corporate purse strings.  It will be extremely unlikely that they'll pay for me to go to any of the Perl conference's this year.  Sure I'll ask, but then I'll sit back and wait to see just how loud I'm laughed at.<br/><br/><i>Well, just pay for it yourself then</i>.  Well, my wife and I will be visiting my family in England this Summer and we've got a number of DIY chores (mainly the floor and wall tile in the bathroom's) that we've been putting off for too long and we'd like to get done.  That doesn't exactly leave a bucket load of cash just laying around to be used for conferences I'm afraid.<br/><br/>Oh well, looks like last year's TPC in San Diego will be the last conference I'll attend for the time being at least - sigh.</p>

Everything for everyone seems a little tighter this year. Even though last year was on the front line of the dot-bomb, this year everyone's in recovery, so in many ways its worse. I'm trying to persuade everyone I know to make it a holiday, because you really can have some fun and chill out there. But it really is expensive for everyone involved, so I totally understand those who can't make it. Hope to see you in 2003!!!

<br>Well hopefully I'll be able to go in 2003.  Actually, I hope I'll be able to go <b>this</b> year, it just doesn't look promising at the moment I'm afraid.
