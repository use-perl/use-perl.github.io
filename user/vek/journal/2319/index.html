<p>You know, pretty soon we won't be allowed to buy anything in the bloody supermarket without being a member of their bloody club.  Typical conversation goes like this:<br/><br/><b>Cashier</b>:  Do you have your (*insert supermarket name here*) club card with you today?
<b>Me</b>: Er, no.
<b>Cashier</b>: Would you like one?
<b>Me</b>: No thankyou.
<b>Cashier</b>: Did you know you could save money today?
<b>Me</b>: Yes, I'm fine thanks.
<b>Cashier</b>: It will just take 2 seconds to sign up.
<b>Me</b>: No it's ok, I really don't want my buying habits to end up in your database and my information sold to anyone you choose.
<b><i>Naive</i> Cashier</b>: Oh sir, I really don't think we'd do that, we're just trying to save you money.<br/><br/>So I walked out and went next door instead - fuckwits.</p>

<h2>Have You Considered Rude Behavior?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chaoticset/">chaoticset</a> on 2002-01-22T16:29:38</h3>
A friend of mine had a favorite way of getting rid of anybody trying to sell/give him something he didn't want.  They would start with something like
<p>
"Hi, can I (insert activity here) for you?"
</p><p>
and he'd say
</p><p>
"No, you can't.  Get the f**k away from me, actually."
</p><p>
It didn't always work to his advantage, sure...but it always kept 'em away.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>
