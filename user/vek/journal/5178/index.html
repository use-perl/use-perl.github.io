<p>Haven't been back to blighty in 3 years so I'm getting all excited.  I rang my Mum last night to ask her to get some of the stuff I miss over here - Weetabix, Marmite, Tesco's Curry (I kid you not) and Ambrosia Rice Pudding.<br/><br/>The nice co-incidence about the upcoming visit is that it's in the middle of the World Cup.  I'm sure I'll be down the pub with my brother-in-law to watch some of the games (he's an Arsenal fan but I try not to hold that against him - big Spurs fan me!).<br/><br/>My wife wants to go to Stonehenge (don't ask me why) so I'm sure the whole family will trek down there - stare blankly at some big rocks for 5 minutes and then leave :-)  There's something about Americans and wanting to see Stonehenge.  I really couldn't care less - perhaps it's a "Brit" thing??<br/><br/>Now, remembering how to drive on the "correct" side of the road ought to be a good laugh :-)</p>

<p>I've never heard of the last two, but I've seen Weetabix and Marmite at the grocery stores here in Albuquerque -- which does not have a large British population, by any stretch of the imagination.</p>

I see weetabix occasionally.  For some strange reason, Marmite isn't that difficult to find in the US.  It's certainly not common, but even in the burbs you're likely to find half a dozen small jars tucked away in some supermarket aisle.  In the cities it's harder to find because there are so many smaller groceries that just don't have a great deal of stock.  Must have a high profit per shelf foot with a long shelf life...
<p>
Vegemite, on the other hand, is more difficult to find in general, but easy to find in the gourmet/whole foods sort of store.  Promite, on the other hand, never seems to make it across the pond.  I think I've seen a jar of that stuff exactly once, and that wasn't in the western hemisphere.</p>

Vegemite in a gourmet section? My gods, what were they thinking?<br> <br>(posting from the land down under)

I haven't seen Vegemite here in the US as yet but in England (as far as I recall - it's been a few years now) I found Vegemite in the gourmet section of certain "health food" shops.

You know how Vegemite (and others) are like emacs/vi - you either love them or hate them? I'm in the "cannot stand the foul taste of Vegemite" camp.<br> <br>Hence my horror at finding it in a 'gourmet' section.<br> <br>Here in Australia, it doesn't seem to be much of problem finding Vegemite (understandably), Marmite or Promite in your average supermarket.<br> <br>Still won't buy any. =)<br> <br>

That's 'gourmet', as in 'expensive imported food that you generally won't find produced in the US of A'.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Hmm, I've never seen Weetabix here in Phoenix (and trust me - I've looked!).  I <b>did</b> find Marmite once at a tiny little "specialty" grocery shop - but it went out of business about 2 weeks later and I've yet to find anywhere else.<br> <br>Tesco's are a supermarket chain in England and they make (or used to at least) a rather good can of Curry if I do say so myself.<br> <br>As for Ambrosia Rice Pudding, picture a bowl of thick creamy milk with rice added.  I know it <b>sounds</b> awful but it's <b>really</b> bloody good<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>Where's `Home'</h2>

Let us know and we may be able to organise an `extraordinary' perl mongers' meet...

<p>So you can bring back a boatload of stuff. I'm wondering what I will miss from the US when I'm in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.fi and think maybe I should set up my Cheeze-it supply line now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Maybe I could open a business for expat cravings and make a killing in the US junkfood supply<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Enjoy the visit home, 3 years is too long. And if your wife is a yank, forgive her the stonehenge trip as it's always hard to think of the places you grew up as tourist-worthy excursions<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I'll be amused at YAPC when people pile down to the St. Louis Riverfront for a trip in the Gateway Arch as the lines are long and on a humid day [ summertime ] you can't see terribly far anyway...It's pretty dull to be honest but the park is nice<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
