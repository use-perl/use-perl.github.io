<p>So it happened.  I've actually been officially asked to *stop* using Mozilla as my (work) mail client.  Of course they want me to use Outlook because then I can be sent all those appointment/meeting/reminders that automatically get imported into the "scheduler".<br/><br/>And true to form, I've officially decided *not* to touch Outlook with a 5ft pole.<br/><br/>Go me :-)</p>

What about Evolution?  Can it handle the calendar/schedule things as well these days?  I haven't tried it in a while.

I haven't used Evolution since I removed linux from my corporate laptop (long story - I think I wrote a journal entry about it).  I could switch to using my linux desktop to read mail but I work from home sometimes and therefore like to keep all my mail on my laptop - so I'm stuck with windows.<br> <br>This is the second time Outlook has been pushed on me.  Well, the first time it was "suggested", yesterday I was "asked".  I've still got a couple of lives left so I'll just use Mozilla until the big boys with baseball bats come to visit<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>To be honest I don't know what the big deal is.<br> <br>Do I answer all my corporate e-mail? - when required, yep.<br>Do I forget about meetings? - nope.<br>Am I late to meetings? - nope.<br> <br>People can function perfectly well without Outlook holding their hand - I don't know why Management think we're all lost without it...

I know that here they like us to use Outlook so that they can look at our calendar and schedule around us if necessary.  As a result, I have a permanent appointment for "lunch" every day at 11 so that people won't schedule meetings during my preferred lunch time. &gt;:)
</p><p>
To be honest, I like Outlook.  I know it's virus friendly, but quite frankly if my Windows box gets a virus I really don't care because, hey, it's not my computer.  All of my *real* work is on a Linux box anyway.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Be sure to schedule plenty of time for installing patches and cleaning up virus fallout.

<p>I get all my email on my sparc and never go to meetings anymore<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) It works so well that I seem to be unable to get laid off and they just keep sending me bonuses.</p>
