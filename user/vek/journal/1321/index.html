<p>Yep, I was one of the sad video game addicts who rushed out to buy the Gamecube when it came out on Sunday.  <br/><br/>This obsession with all things video game started way back in the day when my parents bought me a Commodore 64 for my birthday (around 1984 ish I think).  Not sure what games were popular in the US back then but in England there was a company called Gremlin Graphics and they gave us such gems as 'Loco', 'Monty Mole', 'Suicide Express' - actually I think it was just one bloke called Tony Crowther or something like that.  Then there was a bloke called Andrew Braysomething and he created some awesome (at least it was awesome for the c-64) games like 'Uridium' and 'Paradroid' (at least I <b>think</b> that's what it was called).  And who could forget the fun we had destroying our controllers (or <b><i>Joysticks</i></b> as I recall they were called) playing those bloody Decathlon or 'Summer Games' games.<br/><br/>Have to find one of those C-64 emulators and spend an evening down memory lane.  After all, my other half decided that the Gamecube should <b>really</b> be a bloody Christmas present - bugger!</p>

...Tycho's lengthy commentary a few days ago on PA, concerning the current wealth of games and consoles.  I, personally, have only enough money for one of the following three activities:  Buying MGS2 and a PS2, buying Halo and an Xbox, or buying Christmas presents for the rest of my family.
<p>
I still don't know if I'm getting the Xbox or PS2.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Mate - you have to think about it?  There would be no third option in my book!  Ok, well I suppose I'd choose the Christmas presents for my family - but under protest (grin).  I'm more of a nintendo-geek so I don't really have any opinions on the PS2 or the XBOX (but I do actually own a PS1 however).  The SNES was a killer console - that was back in the day before Squaresoft defected to Sony (grin).  Nintendo64 suffered from a lack of decent games IMHO - save for the 'industry influencing' Mario64, DK64 and the two Zelda's.  So, this year I've been blessed with the Gameboy Advance &amp; the Gamecube - just hope it gets some decent software support.  Hmm, that PS2 does look rather sweet though....

Oh, yes...the SNES.  I beat the crap out of mine...I never saw anybody *else* with controllers that had teeth marks.  I loved that thing to death.  (Had the big controller that mimicked the layout of the arcade buttons for Street Fighter II, and it got a bit of pounding as well.)
<p>
Hey, Squaresoft went where the power was at the time. Now, there's a real battle.  The N64 had one game (Bond) and then got a better one (Dark).  *shrug*
</p><p>
I'll probably end up with an Xbox, mainly because of the development support that's supposed to come with it.  (Hey, maybe there'll be a port of Perl to the Xbox!  BoxPerl?  XPerl?)</p>
