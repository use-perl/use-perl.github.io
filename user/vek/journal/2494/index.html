<p>You've got to say that being a weatherman in Phoenix is bloody easy.  It's going to be hot tomorrow, and then it's going to be hot the day after that too.  See, I can do it already (grin).  But just last night on our local CBS news, he uttered the outragous statement that we could get snow on Wednesday - <b>in</b> Phoenix.<br/><br/>So, needless to say, when I see that pig flying around the top of my house I'll believe said weatherman.</p>

Yeah, some parts of the Valley (as Metro Phoenix is known) had what I'd like to describe as softish rain/slushy stuff a few years back.  Didn't settle on the ground of course and there has been some debate as to whether it really <b>was</b> snow.  I didn't get any of the "whatever is was" in my area though and I'm always sceptical whenever I hear the words <i>snow</i> and <i>Phoenix</i> in the same sentance (grin).

<br>
<br>From the ashes of its own snowfall, the Phoenix will rise again.

I've always thought it would be great to be a weather(man|person).  How many jobs can you name where you can be absolutely, 100%, no-doubt-about it wrong almost all of the time, and at the end of the day, everyone says "See you tomorrow!"?
