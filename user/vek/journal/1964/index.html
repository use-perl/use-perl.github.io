<p>So I finally had to admit that running linux on my laptop at work was actually becoming a productivity issue.<br/><br/>I use my linux <b>desktop</b> for development & ssh'ing into the Sun boxes - no dual boot there.  My laptop is primarily used for e-mail and some 'work-from-home' type activities and I've had a dual-boot environment for a while now..  As I think I think I mentioned before, our development ticketing system here is a proprietary Windows app[1].  So that means that I have to re-boot into Windows everytime I need to view tickets assigned to me or add my 2 cents & development notes to a given ticket.  <br/><br/>You can imagine how frustrating it is when someone asks me to 'just bring up this ticket and have a look at the analysis notes with me for a second'.  So I exit out of Evolution, exit out of Gnome, wait for linux to shutdown, wait for Windows to boot, launch the ticketing app.  <b>Phew</b> all that for a 5 second peek at a ticket.<br/><br/>There's more.  Living in the corporate asylum means I'm surrounded by excel spreadsheets, word documents etc.  Now, Abiword/Gnumeric & Sun's Staroffice do a decent job at <b>trying</b> to display those documents correctly - it's just that they <b>don't</b> display them correctly and that's a shame.  In fact I almost missed a very important piece of info on a design document because Abiword left a line out!  I only caught it because I asked a co-worker to print me a copy just before going into a meeting.  I remember saying "wait a minute, that line is <b>not</b> on the document I read".  Of course, it was there all along but Abiword did not display it for some reason.<br/><br/>I played with VMWare so that I could at least <b>try</b> and still use linux.  Unfortunately, my corporate laptop is not 'top of the line' and running VMWare is a little resource intensive and running certain apps slowed my laptop to a crawl.  Either that, or the windows apps wouldn't run at all(the ticketing app for example).<br/><br/>So last night, while waiting for The X-Files to start, I removed the linux partition.  It was a sad event.<br/><br/>Still, I can make the whole windows experience somewhat bearable.  Obviously, Mozilla will be the browswer/e-mail client of choice.  I'll install Cygwin so I can have a *nix ish environment.  And <a href="http://www.litestep.net">litestep</a> will replace the damn Explorer shell.  Actually litestep has some cool themes, my current theme is <a href="http://www.litestep.net/comment.php?id=134&type=theme">plastik</a> and there's even a <a href="http://www.litestep.net/comment.php?id=406&type=theme">ximian     gnome</a> theme that will help make me think that I'm really not running windows.<br/><br/>[1] - As mentioned before, this ticketing system was purchased by some genius with leftover Y2K money.  Prior to that a predecessor of mine had written a nice web ticketing system with a MySQL backend, sigh.</p>

Ask your boss for a Sunblade 100 or any of the Ultra machines.  You can install a PCI card that has its own CPU (a celeron) and RAM.  You can then install and run Windows <i>within</i> Solaris, in its own window.
<p>
I realize Solaris ain't Linux, but it'll save you the hassle of rebooting.</p>
