<p>when the cost of the repairs you've had to have done (in the last 3 months alone) are close to what the bloody thing is worth.<br/><br/>Nov 2001 - Thermostat & water pump - $400
Dec 2001 - New transmission - $2300
Jan 2002 - New oil pan - $300<br/><br/>And you know what, as it sits in my garage, the bloody thing does not change gear properly - noticed that re-occurance in the last few day's.  The "check engine" light came on today indicating some emissions related problem.  When is it ever going to end.<br/><br/>The really f**king annoying thing is that the car itself is less than 5 years old and I still have 2 more car payments to make.  It's a f**king lemon I swear.<br/><br/><b>Never</b> going to buy a Ford again.<br/><br/>So on that note, tomorrow I'm off to look at <a href="http://www.chrysler.com/pt_cruiser/models/limited_edition.html">PT Cruisers</a>.  Current opinion on a PT Cruiser is like <a href="http://www.guinness.com">Guinness</a> - you either love it or you hate it.  I <b>love</b> Guinness (actually Murphy's is my favorite tipple) and I think I'm taking a liking to PT Cruisers (in a London cab on steriods kind of way).</p>

<h2>Get a Volvo</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2002-01-05T17:25:23</h3>
<p>My last Volvo had over 350,000 miles on it before the body started to rot  and the new one has been 3 years without a day of trouble. Also, 85% of the Volvos ever made are still on the road. They are good, solid, practical dependable cars.</p>
