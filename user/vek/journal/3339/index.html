<div class="span8">
<p>Cheers <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Matts/journal/">matts</a>, saved me a code re-write.  A former co-worker of mine wrote an in-house module years ago that does almost everything Time::Piece does.  <b>Except</b> that it's sloooow, really slooow.  I've been wanting to re-write the damn thing for <b>ages</b>, it uses Date::Manip which I think is the offending beast.  I never got around to the re-write of course and faced the "opinions" of those higher up on the totem pole at work, <i>yeh but our in-house module just works, if it aint broke don't fix it</i>.  So, tonight I wrote some benchmark code, just had both modules calc today's date in YYYYMMDD format (20000 iterations):
<code>
Benchmark: timing 20000 iterations of Time::Piece, DateAndTime.pm...
Time::Piece:  7 wallclock secs ( 6.68 usr +  0.39 sys =  7.07 CPU) @ 2828.85/s (n=20000)
DateAndTime.pm: 168 wallclock secs (162.68 usr  0.03 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.02 csys = 162.73 CPU) @ 122.92/s (n=20000)
</code>
'kay, I think I'll use Time::Piece thanks...
</p>

<h2>Date::Manip</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-03-07T14:45:24</h3>
FWIW, from Date/Manip.pod:<br/><br/><blockquote><div>
The downside is that Date::Manip is slow, especially when compared to several of the other Date/Time modules which are written in C.  Although I am working on making Date::Manip faster, it will never be as fast as these modules.  And before anyone asks, Date::Manip will never be translated to C (at least by me).  I write C because I have to.  I write perl because I like to.  Date::Manip is something I do because it interests me, not something I'm paid for.<br/><br/>
Yes, Date::Manip is VERY SLOW.  Don't use it unless you want to be slow, or need something only Date::Manip provides.</div></blockquote>



<h2>Time::Piece is my favorite module</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-03-08T18:17:16</h3>
<p>A design for something identical to this module was etched in red on my whiteboard for the first six months of 2000.  (After Dec. 31, 1999 when I fixed a bunch of contract code that was supposed to have been reviewed, and then spent Jan. 3 reviewing it and thinking.  Am I the only person who actually read the docs to localtime() the first time he used it?)  Of course, I had no time to actually implement the thing.  Then one day Time::Object appeared.  I was amazed; it was as if Matt had read my mind.  (And I snickered at the bug report that launched the comments by Larry that launched the module.  Am I the only person who -- oh, never mind.)</p>

<p>Time::{Object,Piece} gets my vote for best module ever.  I guarantee the code in that module is executed more often on our servers than any other module in CPAN.  Prior to that we had command-line utilities that did date arithmetic on YYMMDD[HH[MM]] timestamps.  The utilities were crufty Perl rewrites of a decent original C implementation (C didn't make it from SunOS to Solaris because somebody didn't have the right docs).  Prior to that there was actually a set of cron jobs that wrote datestamps for the last n days, hours, etc. into files which people read with backticks.  I wrote eponymous Perl functions for all our utilities using Time::Object, and then rewrote the utilities to call the functions.  And, thanks to POD, our utilities now have manpages.:)</p>

<p>For the short time when jhi was going to put Time::Piece in core, someone observed that most of the date-related entries in the FAQ could be replaced with "See Time::Piece."<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
