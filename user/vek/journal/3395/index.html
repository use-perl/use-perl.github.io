<p>Last night we watched 'Seven' for the first time in <b>ages</b>.  I had forgotten what a good movie that is.  Kevin Spacey was <b>really</b> good in that - he usually is though.  I really liked him in "The Usual Suspects" too.<br/><br/>You know how you remember movies that you haven't seen since you were a kid and you remember them being <b>really</b> good.  So when you spot them in the TV guide you think "cool, I'll watch that".  So, after "Seven" we decided to watch "Superman II" and "Krull".  All I can say is "what a pile of dog-crap", I can't believe I used to think they were any good :-)<br/><br/>I'm starting to get worried whether the same will be true of "Tron".  A classic (at least I used to think it was) that I haven't seen since I was a kid - hope I'm not disappointed...<br/><br/></p>

Krull was one of the first movies I ever taped.  I still like it, even if the characters are cheesy and the plot makes no sense.
<p>
Let's see, you're a 50 foot tall space alien who's determined to marry a human female.  Said female somehow has the power of fire which, when given to husband, will destroy you.  Instead of simply crushing human female's skull the first chance you get, you imprison her in a fortress, where she will ultimately be rescued and you'll be destroyed.  Right.
</p><p>
I still like the one quote, though - <i>Fame - now that's an empty purse. Count it and go broke. Eat it and go hungry. Seek it, and go mad</i>
</p><p>
Oh, and what <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i> geek *didn't* have a Glaive in their arsenal after that?</p>
