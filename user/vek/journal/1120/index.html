<p>First post.<br/><br/>Never felt the need to air any angry thoughts until I read <a href="http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=display&uid=1087>matts</a>' journal entry this morning.  Click on the link to the Google groups he posts to see what I mean.  Guys like <b>** name changed to protect the innocent **</b> really get my goat.  It's called open source mate, if you think you can do better submit a friggin' patch or better yet write your own XML application server.  We've probably all been on the receiving end of ungrateful gits at some point - you know what I'm talking about - hours and *hours* of hard work to be faced with "yeah but it doesn't do this" or "that's not really what we had in mind" etc.  Most people don't air their friggin ungrateful opinions on public mailing lists however.<br/><br/>'kay, I'm done now.

I won't defend clintp, but really, you should just accept criticism for what it is, and move on.  It is inevitable, and it does no good to complain about it.  People will vent, people will express their opinions.  As long as they are not attacking you personally, just<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... move on.

Point taken.  Perhaps in hindsight I wouldn't/shouldn't have posted that little rant.  I'd just been on the receiving end of some of that ungratefulness from the ol' day job.  Was a bit peeved you see<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
<br>
<br>Yes, you're right of course, ctitcism is inevitable and it didn't do any good complaining about it in the end did it?
<br>
<br>Consider me moved on...

I dunno, maybe it did good.  If you want to complain about it, I won't mind.  But one thing I hate more than ungratefulness is when people waste their time being upset by it.  You have better things to do than to be brought down by others.
