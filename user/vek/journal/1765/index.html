<p>Wow, use.perl.org, I remember this site (*grin*)  Ok so Windows boxes *are* useful I suppose.  Why?  <a href="http://www.poolofradiance.com">Pool Of Radiance</a> - that's why.  Until linux can run these games I suppose my Windows machine will still get the odd boot or two.  That and 'Black & White' - these are *the* reasons why any sane video game addict *needs* a Windows box.<br/><br/>I overheard someone at work saying that a new version of Mandrake supposedly let's you play Windows games.  May be worth checking out...</p>

<p>Not Black &amp; White, most likely, but if you're talking
about the old Gold Box series of AD&amp;D games, they should
probably work.</p>

<p>But then again, Quake, Tribes 2, and Unreal Tournament
have Linux clients, although I'll be damned if I can
get them to run right.  One of four reasons I still have a Windows
box myself.</p>

Those Gold Box games predated any remotely usable version of Windows... I remember them from Junior High.  Can you run DOS games in Wine?  I haven't finished the Krynn series, and would definitely give it a try.
<p>
Of course, I did just buy a Dreamcast.  Jet Grind Radio is harder on my wrists than writing, pays less, and still manages to be more entertaining.</p>

Hmm, I also tried to get Unreal Tournament to run on Linux.  Alas, no luck.  It's a shame really, Linux rocks, <b>but</b> it cannot run these bloody addictive games.  If Pool Of Radiance would run on linux - oh the joy...
<br>
<br>So, if you're a sad video game addict (er, like myself) you can't help but run back to 'GatesVille' to immerse yourself in these games.  If you've read my earlier journal you'll know that I've got a GameCube under the ol' tree waiting to be unwrapped on Tuesday - can hardly wait.
<br>
<br>Hmm, I'm quite sad in that respect. (*grin*)

I should clarify.  I wasn't able to get nVidia's
drivers to work as advertised, and thus couldn't
run it as a client.  However, UT on Linux ran
fine as a server.  (20+ servers running on an Athlon
800.  Of course, no people on 20+ servers, but it
did run.)
