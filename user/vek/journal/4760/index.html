<p>One of the pieces of a project I'm currently working on involves sending requests to a remote server via a socket connection and parsing the response.  No rocket science involved there.  So finally (because of some inane firewall restrictions) I was able to reach the remote server yesterday.  Yippee I thought, time to do some testing.<br/><br/>Hmm, the responses I received from the remote server didn't really match the documentation I was given.  So I send off a rather polite e-mail asking our sister office to explain the responses.  So this morning my inbox has been graced with one of the most sarcastic replies I've ever received.  I won't post the contents but here's the opening line:<br/><br/><i>"Sigh, well you obviously seem to be forgetting the Authorization Header Response comes first..."</i><br/><br/>"Authorization Header Response" - WTF?  I double checked their documentation once more just to make sure I wasn't on drugs the first time I read it.  Then I calmly compose my reply, here's the opening line:<br/><br/><i>"Well, you obviously seem to be forgetting that there's *no* mention of an 'Authorization Response Header' in your documentation."</i><br/><br/>Fuckwits.</p>

<h2>&quot;Sigh, well you obviously seem...&quot;</h2>

I've never seen any five words of English that are as histrionic and passive-aggressive as "Sigh, well you obviously seem...".

<p>"obviously seem" is the passive-agressive part -- "obviously" gives you the aggressive, and then "seem" is the passive mincing part.

</p><p>And "Sigh, well" is the histrionic part.

</p><p>I advise immediately killing the person who wrote that. Or maybe they can be simply lobotomized and sent to work as a farm-hand, or a state senator.</p>
