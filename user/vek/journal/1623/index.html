<p>My friend showed me <a href="http://www.try2hack.nl/">this</a> site.  It's a little game where you try and see if you can figure out how to advance to the next page or maybe it's teaching you to become a cracker??<br/><br/>The first one had me stumped for a minute or two until I thought <i>'doh, just view the source of the web page'</i> - there's the password in the javascript (kicks himself).  The second page is one of those bloody Flash thingy's and seemed to only work when I tried it on IE - even though I downloaded the Moz plugin.  This one had me stumped as well (a cracker I'm obviously not!).  My friend had already figured it out so told me - just save the *.swf file and view it in a hex editor - ascii strings baby! (another doh moment).<br/><br/>I stopped at level 4 as it appears I'll have to find a Java decompiler to poke around in the .class file to figure it out - I don't have <b>that</b> much spare time.  Oh well, it was fun (ish) for a little while at least *grin* - maybe I'll go googling tomorrow to find a decompiler - maybe.</p>
