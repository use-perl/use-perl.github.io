<p>So I'm now the proud owner of a Samsung <a href="http://www.samsungusa.com/cgi-bin/nabc/prod/hhcommerce/telecommunications/sph_a460_gallery.jsp">SPH A460</a>.  I like it.  It doesn't actually <b>work</b> but I like it :-)<br/><br/>Called to activate the phone and the config menu I'm supposed to get doesn't show up.  "You need to take the phone back to the store as it's not working how it should" was the final decision by the <a href="www.sprintpcs.com">Sprint</a> rep.<br/><br/>Too add insult to injury the phone call lasted 1hr 53 minutes.  Along with activating the new phone I was trying to convert my existing plan over to one of their "add-a-phone, shared-minutes family plan" thingies.  At one point there were 4 people in the rep's cubie trying to figure out why the system wasn't working the way it should.  I kid you not, they had the rep, his supervisor and two "experts" ('cause they'd been there the longest) trying to change my account.  The supervisor couldn't apologize enough - gave me a decent credit on my account to thank me for being so patient.  Good thing too because I was *this* close to telling them where they could stick their fscking service :-)<br/><br/>Anyhoo, my wife exchanged the phone for a new one this morning so (fingers crossed) I'll be able to get it activated and actually use the bloody thing tonight :-)</p>
