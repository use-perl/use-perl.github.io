<h1>Office Christmas Party</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>Most of the development team (including my boss) are not going to this year's office christmas party extravaganza.  I'm one of the developers who will <b>not</b> be attending.  Why the bah humbug almost <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/davorg/journal/>davorg</a> like attitude.  Well, off the top of my head, here goes:<br/><br/><li>Most of us are sick of pulling last minute solutions out of our collective arses with no thanks or appreciation.  Whoa - steady on now, I'm sure most developers feel this way...</li>
<li>The party is actually at someones house <b>and</b> we have to <b>pay</b> for it.  If you bring your significant other, you have to pay for them too.  I'll say that again, <i>it's at someones house not a ballroom</i>.</li>
<li>The promised pay raises didn't happen <b>but</b> the new expensive office furniture/decorating sure looks nice as do all those brand new PC's (which the developers did <b>not</b> get their hands on) (grin)</li>
<li>All contractor reserved covered parking spaces were taken away, employees now have to pay for the pleasure of parking their car in their employers covered parking spaces[1]</li>
<li>This year there was no birthday card, no 'happy birthday' no birthday lunch - you get the picture.  Yep, other people's birthday's are celebrated.</li><br/><br/><b>But</b> we're supposed to <i>get in the spirit of things</i> and show up at this "party".  I don't think so - bah humbug. (grin)<br/><br/>[1] Unless you've had the pleasure of being in Arizona in late July, you have no real comprehension of just how much a god-send covered parking can be.  Unless you like getting into your car that's been baking all day long in 120 degree heat - in which case you're a bit of a sicko (grin).</p>

<h2>paying for a party</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2001-12-05T22:20:12</h3>
<p>sure beats getting in the unemployment queue. Alcohol is expensive, liability insurance is expensive, catered food is more expensive than both combined. Having thrown a few parties at my house where people seem to think the 'party fairy' makes it all happen...and then complain about the free cold Guinness beer in the can I applaud people who ask for help in defraying the cost...even companies as they are especially expensive in this economy.</p>

<p>Cheer up and go have a few drinks and eat some food and enjoy...I mean...at least they invited you!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<i>...sure beats getting in the unemployment queue.</i>
<br>
<br>Sigh - yes it does hfb thanks for pointing that one out.  In this economy I should be grateful to have a job right?
<br>
<br><nobr> <wbr></nobr><i>..I applaud people who ask for help in defraying the cost...even companies as they are especially expensive in this economy.</i>
<br>
<br>Actually it's really not the paying for it that had me in humbug mode - in fact I've 'chipped-in' at friends parties <b>many</b> times in the past - it's just that said company spends money like $style = 'going out of'; (grin).  It was the birthday shaft that got to me - I look forward to the ol' birthday cake you see (grin).
<br>
<br> <i>Cheer up and go have a few drinks and eat some food and enjoy...</i>
<br>
<br>I'll absolutely be doing all the above hfb, didn't mean to sound as grumpy as I did.
