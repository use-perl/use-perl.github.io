<p>So I see <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20020220/ap_on_hi_te/google_ads_1&cid=528">google</a> is now offering a program whereby companies can pay to have their search results displayed more prominently - sigh.<br/><br/><b>Update:</b> well, thanks to <a href=" http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=3372&cid=4781">Wodin</a> I see that I was a little hasty.  Turns out it's the <b>ads</b> that are displayed more prominently, not the search results, thanks mate.</p>

<h2>The best quote</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2002-02-20T04:42:17</h3>
<blockquote><div>"We take our editorial integrity very seriously,    just like a newspaper does," [the VP of sales] said.</div></blockquote> <br> <br>Um, what newspaper?  Not the <a href="http://www.fair.org/media-outlets/nyt.html" title="fair.org">New York Times</a fair.org>.  And not <a href="http://www.fair.org/media-outlets/wpost-newsweek.html" title="fair.org">The Washington post</a fair.org>.<br> <br>Or maybe they intend to take it exactly as seriously as those two papers do.  Which is to say that they will take the money they are paid very seriously and do right by their advertisers.



<h2>The only difference is in the ads</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Wodin/">Wodin</a> on 2002-02-20T05:44:53</h3>
I'm confused why people are upset about this. All it means is that advertisers who pay more are going to get the top ads -- the ads themselves will remain the same, and show up in the same place they always did. They're not compromising the integrity of the search results any more than they did before.

Hmm, I'll have to go back and re-read the article as that's <b>not</b> the way I understood it...

Yeah, looks like you're right.  In my haste I thought it was saying that the prominence of <b>search results</b> would be increased by paying more money.  My bad<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
