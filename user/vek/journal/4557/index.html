<p>I must say that I've been more than a little curious with all the Perly folk praising all things Mac.  Since Saturday I've had to go to my local CompUSA for various bits & pieces a couple of times.  On both occasions I've found myself drawn towards the Apple section of the store.  Played with the new iMac, iBook, Powerbook and a <b>really</b> nice Powermac G4 with one of those 22" flat panel displays.<br/><br/>I must say I'm more than a little interested.  At some point towards Christmas I was planning on buying a laptop and I'm thinking it may be Apple that receives my hard-earned dollars.  Hmmm...</p>

Probably going to wait until October, though, unless some windfall of cash comes through that I'm not expecting.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

Apple just released a new version of the tiBook yesterday w/ faster processors.  I figure by October, they'll have a SuperDrive in 'em.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

I think the G5's will be out by then as well.  If so, I think it will be a Christmas present to myself.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
