<p>So it was with some reluctance that I removed Linux from my <b>work</b> laptop and went back to winblows a month or so ago (I think I wrote a journal entry about it...) because of damn corporate peer pressure (windows only apps, excel spreadsheets, word docs etc...).  So I was quite happy (well as happy as I could be with winblows) using <a href="http://www.litestep.net">litestep</a> and cygwin coupled with Mozilla as my browser/email-client of choice.<br/><br/>So the powers that be have decided to use that really effin' annoying "feature" of Outlook whereby you can send appointments or reminders to your co-workers and their Outlook calenders get automatically populated with said reminder.  Of course, because I'm using Mozilla to read mail, all the "auto-reminder" bulls**t is lost on me.<br/><br/>So people are getting annoyed that I don't "accept" their appointments.  You get the role of the eyes and the "Oh I thought <b>everyone</b> used Outlook" followed by the look as if you're from another Planet.  I usually make some flippant off-the-cuff remark about Micro$oft and they shut up.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I can see the writing on the wall.  Seeing as upper Management <b>love</b> that auto-appointment crapola, I'm just waiting to be <b>forced</b> into using Outlook - sigh... <br/><br/>At least I've still got Linux on my desktop and at least <b>that</b> won't change.</p>

<br>Give them all an Outlook virus.  IT'LL BE A LAFF RIOT.

I'm lucky in that we <b>don't do meetings</b>. So I'm in email client heaven at the moment - I run Pine on Windows (PC-Pine), which has one flaw (no mak all read feature), but other than that it's perfect for me. The nice thing about Litestep is you can launch Outloook if you really need to, so appointments aren't a disaster, only outlook won't remind you if its not running, of course<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
<br>
<br>My one wish is that litestep let you do some things without spawning the start bar, which seems to take 100% CPU up, such as running control panel apps, and the task manager, and Explorer itself. Maybe a future version will address that.
