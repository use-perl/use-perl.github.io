<p>Back home from blighty.  <br/><br/>Feels strange to be back and I can't quite put my finger on why that might be.  Perhaps for the first time in 7 years I might be feeling a tad homesick for the ol' homeland?  Hmm, weird I tell ya.<br/><br/>Anyway, had an <b>excellent</b> time.  Didn't touch a keyboard in two weeks, had no "net" access whatsoever and <b>still</b> lived to tell the tale :-)<br/><br/>It was great seeing my family again.  It was great seeing old friends again.  I even bumped into an old Sixth Form teacher of mine in a pub one night.  I was bloody surprised that he recognized me and we had a really good conversation.<br/><br/>Visted Stonehenge - I'll upload some photos onto my <a href="http://vek.perlmonk.org">Useless Bollocks</a> site in the next few days to prove it!<br/><br/>Visited the Isle Of Wight (at Wife's request).  Wife got to ride in a hovercraft for the first time - and loved it.  While we were there we (my Mum, my Dad, my Brother-in-law, my Sister, my Wife) watched England beat Denmark in a quaint little thatched cottage turned pub - fantastic atmosphere, great time was had by all.<br/><br/>Driving on the "correct" side of the road was, er, interesting for the first 5 minutes or so.  Remembering which lane you had to be in for going straight over at a roundabout had me all buggered up at first.  A couple of nice reminders from my Sister (a rather good backseat driver actually) had me driving like a pro again in no time!  Did someone shrink all the parking spaces though?  A 7 point turn just to get out of a bloody parking space in Cambridge had me cracking up!<br/><br/>Seeing all the Summer festival adverts had me feeling a little nostalgic.  Did I really survive that tent at Glastonbury back in the day?  Can't quite see my Wife going for that now though :-)<br/><br/>Pubs.  Pubs are great.  In my neck of the woods here in the suburbs of Phoenix we don't have anything remotely like pubs.  Needless to say we made up for that.  I think we went down the pub everyday.  You know, it might not be a bad idea to give Mr Beer and friends a rest for a while :-)<br/><br/>Sigh, it's time to get back into the swing of things again though (don't you hate that).  On today's agenda - catch up with bills, mow lawn, take car for Emissions test, buy food, play with dogs, make phonecalls.  I have a spare couple of minutes right now so I think I'll try and catch up on some journals.<br/><br/>One thing is for sure, I'll certainly try and go back to England more often.  It's all the little things you miss.
