<p>Yep, I <b>did</b> actually get up and watch the England-Argentina game this morning.  With matchsticks holding eyelids open and coffee in hand I was treated to a nice little footie game.  Hey that Teddy Sheringham bloke almost scored an absolute <b>cracker</b> within minutes of coming on.  Spurs player of course...</p>

And what a result it was...<br> <br>We looked a little cramped at the end, but Argentina were pushing very hard.  <br> <br>To say I'm delighed though, is an understatement<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-D<br>

<i>We looked a little cramped at the end, but Argentina were pushing very hard.</i> <br> <br>Yeah, the last 15 minutes or so were a little nerve-wracking to say the least as Argentina were really putting the pressure on.<br> <br> <i>To say I'm delighted though, is an understatement.</i> <br> <br>I'm rather chuffed myself.  My wife asked me when I was going to stop grinning - 'oh, not for a while' I replied<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I only got to watch the last 30 minutes of the match (slept in a bit) and it was well worth it. I got to see a couple of Sheringham's shots.<br> <br>Being a Yank I don't really have much of an interest regarding who won the match but I was sort of pulling for England. Curious ot see how Owen matures in this World Cup.<br> <br>Now, I really need to buy my girlfriend a vcr so I can tape all the matches at night and watch them through the day.

I've watched at least bits of all the matches so far, and the England/Argentina event was one of the better ones.  Croatia/Italy was really good too (wow, what an amazing turn of events!), though I suppose I am partial to USA/Portugal.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>My brother in California stayed up late (until 3 a.m. or so) to watch the USA game; my brother in Ohio got up early (4 a.m. or so).  I TiVo'd it and watched it when I woke up.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
