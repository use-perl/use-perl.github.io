<p>Sigh.  So my boss has decided to 'share the joy' and start giving perl tickets to one of my co-workers.  Said co-worker is a QA/test/DBA type guy with no real perl knowledge.  Said co-worker is obviously just hacking pieces of existing code together with no real understanding of what's going on behind the scenes.  <b>Then</b> when the program doesn't work or doesn't compile or doesn't do what he wants - he's in my cubicle asking me why and 'could you just take a look at...'.  So, seems like I've just been made chief perl trainer all without my knowledge - isn't that nice.  Part of me wants to tell him to bugger off and ask my boss but I suppose I'm too nice for that and end up helping him anyway.  Sigh.<br/><br/>My boss knows perl.  He has some really cool ideas and has written some pretty cool perl progs in his time.  Problem is, he is <b>not</b> a fan of <i>-w</i> or using <i>strict</i> so his code is sometimes a real challenge to mantain - 'where the fuck did <b>that</b> variable come from'.  So just recently he had to maintain one of my large-ish cgi progs - uses <i>strict</i> of course - and he was a little lost.  Needless to say he's now saying he <b>hates</b> using <i>strict</i> and it's a real pain in the ass to maintain.  Obviously, being the perl person that I am, I couldn't disagree more.  So, I finally convinced him to try it and he's been writing a module for our use and <b>trying</b> to adhere to <i>strict</i>.  When I go past his cubicle I can hear him muttering under his breath - yesterday he storms into my cubicle asking me if I had a book he could borrow with more examples of using <i>strict</i>.  Double sigh.<br/><br/>Not sure how this is going to turn out.  I have visions of him giving up and saying that from now on we're <b>not</b> to code perl this way - and all because no-one else has enough knowledge to maintain the code in my absence.  Isn't that a bit fucked up??  Anyhoo, I'm sure everything will be <b>rosy</b>, he'll grok using <i>strict</i> and will grow to love coding perl this way.  Triple sigh.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  He <b>did</b> grok strict and <b>likes</b> it.  Yippee!!</p>

<h2>4 out of 5 dentists recommend use strict;</h2>

I liked it about five minutes after I used it the first time, looking at the errors that came out.  "Whaddaya mean...oh.  Oh, now it works!"
<p>
I can't understand why on Earth people would like *less* feedback about what they're doing.  I'm always looking for *more* feedback, programming or otherwise.  use strict; gives me more feedback.</p>
