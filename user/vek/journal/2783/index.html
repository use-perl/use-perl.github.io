<p>I have a hub sitting on my cubie floor.  For some reason (I forget why) 4 cubicles surrounding mine all have their network cables coming into my cubie and plug into said hub.<br/><br/>We had instructions on Friday before we left for the day to take <b>everything</b> off the floor because we are having new carpet installed at the weekend.<br/><br/>So, after getting my desktop's off the floor (along with the spaghetti like cable mess) all that was left was the hub.  For some reason I decided it would be easier (for me) to just unplug the hub and lay it on top of my cubie.  So I did.<br/><br/>Needless to say, my "neighbours" were none too pleased when I got into work this morning.  Obviously they couldn't get onto the network because of aforementioned hub unplugging.  Said neighbours are also <b>not</b> in the IT group so they're not really network savvy and had no idea their cables came into my cubie.  Apparently they'd called our help desk about 500 times to complain.  <br/><br/>I had intended to get to work early this morning and plug everything back in.  Of course, sods law dictated that I would <b>not</b> in fact be doing <b>anything</b> early this morning thanks to an accident on the I-10.<br/><br/>So I just plugged the hub back in as soon as I got to work and said nothing :)
