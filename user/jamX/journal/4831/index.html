<p>Flame On:
Ok, I have to admit it -- I read Tolkien as a kid and wasn't that impressed
then and now having re-read 'Fellowship'... I'm still not. He doesn't impress
me as a writer at all. Everybody, it seems, loves Tolkien 'cept me. What the
fuck am I missing? Something obviously. I think most people say they love him
without even having actually read any of his stuff. <i>"Everybody else loves him
so I should too."</i><br><br>
Last year I tore through
<a href="http://www.davidfosterwallace.com/books.shtml">DFW's</a> IJ. This
year I'm looking forward to DeLillo's Underworld. Yes I understand these writers
are completely different than Tolkien, and not even in the Fantasy category.
But what is usually found in the Fantasy isn't comparable to people like
Wallace, Pynchon, DeLillo, Vollman etc. and yet I want it to be. I guess that's asking a little much.
Maybe I will be suitably happy finishing 'House of Leaves' or going back and re-reading Snow Crash.<br/><br/></p>

FWIW I just finished reading the Lord of The Rings series and I wasn't particulaly impressed and to be honest I think Tolkien is a little overrated.  But sshhh don't tell anyone as it's not very 'geek-like' to bash Tolkien<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Don't worry, I will definately buy your book. Though it looks as though it won't be available next week as that's when I will have time (vacation) to read through tons of dead wood. Got a copy I can review ?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) <br>I read Sterling's "Heavy Weather" but haven't really been motivated to read much more than that except possibly Schismatrix.

I wouldn't worry too much. I've read him as well and can't see what the fuss is about. Sure he did a good job at world creation - but he did a lousy job relating his tales. At least, he did in my eyes.
