<div class="span8">
<p><p>Today I got my password for BT's "View My Bill" service. After spending a while playing around with the fact that you can enter names against phone bills and then view the bill with names instead of numbers, I decided I really liked this feature ...

<p>... except for all the problems. 

<p>Particularly the way you can enter multiple numbers against the same person or company, except it won't recognise that fact on your bill, so you have to create a different entry in your address book for every number.

<p>Which would be bad enough, except they also restrict you to 75 entries.

<p>So, I decided it would be fun to download this, dump it to a local database, and then write a simple front-end to let me do it myself. Which would also go back as far as I wanted and not just my last 3 bills.

<p>And they conveniently let you download CSV format, so I don't even need to do all the screen-scraping stuff that I started to do before I thought to check! *doh*

<p>So, I put together a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Data-BT-PhoneBill">simple module</a> to parse that, and decided it would be fun to have an interface that overloaded the iterator:

<p><tt>
  my $bill = Data::BT::PhoneBill->new($filename);<br>
<br>
  while (my $call = $bill->next_call) {<br>
  &nbsp;print $call->date, $call->time, $call->destination,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;$call->number, $call->duration, $call->cost;<br>
  &nbsp;}<br>
  }<br>
</tt>

<p>So I wrote my tests, and tried the code. And everything collapsed. In quite serious fashion:

<p><tt>
Operation `!': no method found, argument in overloaded package Data::BT::PhoneBill at /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/Test/Builder.pm line 255.<br>
WHOA!  Somehow you got a different number of results than tests ran!<br>
This should never happen!  Please contact the author immediately!<br>
END failed--call queue aborted.<br>
</tt>

<p>After a lot of puzzlement I eventually tracked everything down to a small failing example. It seems Test::Builder doesn't work very well with overloading:

<p><tt>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w<br>
use strict;<br>
package Eek;<br>
use overload '<>' => \&get_next;<br>
sub new { bless {} }<br>
sub get_next { 1 }<br>
<br>
package main;<br>
use Test::More tests => 1;<br>
ok my $foo = Eek->new, "We got an Eek";<br>
</tt>

<p>So, playing with all this means I never got to write my database stuff, and I'll probably have to do some "real work" for the rest of the week.

<p>Oh well.
