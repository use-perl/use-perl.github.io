<div class="span8">
<p><p>The great Class::DBI clean up continues.

<p>Today I pulled about 150 lines out of the main module into a support module. This was pretty hairy as it was the code that handled all the 'relationships' between classes - which is pretty important stuff for a module that handles database mappings!

<p>I originally attempted to do this via mixins - basically just exporting all the methods I needed. But some of the methods over in Class::DBI proper needed to play with all the relationship data too, so I ended up exporting almost every method, including supposedly 'private' ones, which is always a worrying sign.

<p>Thankfully the hooks I'd added when I was writing the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Class-DBI-mysql-FullTextSearch">Class::DBI::mysql::FullTextSearch module</a> proved their worth. So I was able to take code, such as that for cascading delete, which needed to follow the relationship path, and implemented it trivially in the helper module just registering a delete hook.

<p>Unfortunately, the other major point in Class::DBI where standard behaviour changes if there are relationships is <tt>create()</tt>. If you try to create with a field set to a related object rather than just its id

<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;CD->create({ 
       title => $title, artist => $artist })</tt>
<br>instead of
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;CD->create({ 
        title => $title, artist => $artist->id })</tt>
<br>then it needs to DWIM. And we have no <tt>pre_create</tt> hook as there is no object at that point we can play with :(

<p>For now, I've just implemented a <tt>_tidy_creation_data</tt> method which does nothing in Class::DBI proper, but which gets overridden when you set up a relationship to one that downgrades embedded objects to their ids.

<p>I don't like this though, and I need to find a better way ...
