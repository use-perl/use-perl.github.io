<div class="span8">
<p><p>One of my personal bugbears is web forms which make you jump through lots of hoops to enter dates - particularly the ones which make you guess what those hoops are.

<p>So, for a client job recently which needed a date field, I wrote a 'date' plugin for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=CGI-Untaint">CGI::Untaint</a> which used Date::Manip to parse the date in whichever format you entered it ("2001-12-12", "12th December", "last Monday", "third tuesday in March", etc.) and then feed it to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Date-Simple">Date::Simple</a>, so we'd end up with a standard format (with a nicely overloaded stringification for easy entry straight into a database - through <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Class-DBI">Class::DBI</a>, of course). 
[with credit to Simon Burns for the original idea].

<p>The client loved it. Everything seemed great. I uploaded <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=CGI-Untaint-date">the module</a> to CPAN.

<p>Then I installed it on one my own sites, and everything fell over. Because ironically, the resulting value wasn't taint safe!

<p>It turns out that Date::Manip isn't taint safe at all, doing lots of shell-type things to work out your timezone.

<p>This puzzled me for quite some time. And then yesterday I had a brainwave. Recalling Damian's diary entry on <a href="http://www.yetanother.org/damian/diary_September_2001.html#day_20">locally replacing subs</a>, I threw in a:<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;local *Date::Manip::Date_TimeZone = 
  sub { 'GMT' };</tt>
<br>and everything was rosy again! (We only need dates, not times, so this shouldn't even cause any problems anywhere...)

<P>Which got me to wondering about how to ensure that all my test suites work in a taint clean manner. Although make test can handle the -T option on the shebang line, running the test manually with <tt>perl -Ilib</tt> gives us the old <tt>Too late for "-T" option</tt> error. 

<p>I really need to read up on all the deep magic I can do with ExtUtils::MakeMaker to see if there's some nice way of adding something in there ...

<p>UPDATE: 

<p>Doh!

<p>All I need to do, of course, is <tt>perl -TIlib</tt>.

<p>Of course, I still want to read up more on the magic of MakeMaker ...
