<p>What do you mean I can't rename files?  No, I don't give a damn if you can hack the attic to preserve history.  (then the real fight starts)</p>

<strong>Stage 3:</strong>

<p>Who the **** has locked that file in VSS?  What do you mean they're on vacation?  Where's the damned administrator?</p>

<strong>Stage 4:</strong>

<pre>svn mv this that
svn commit this that -m "Take that, CVS!"
svn merge -r9535:HEAD http://10.1.1.118/svn/pips3/trunk/ .</pre>

<p>What do you mean subversion has lost track of those damned files again?  I just did an <tt>svn mv</tt> and now it's telling me it doesn't exist in source control ... until I try to add it.  And the merge just added a bunch of files but now tells me they're <em>not</em> in source control?  WTF?</p>

<strong>Stage 5:</strong>

<pre>git init .</pre>

<p>Looks good so far ...</p>

<p>Welcome to the fold! The terrors of times past will soon be a distant memory.</p><p>The start will be somewhat bumpy, though, as git breaks with a number of assumptions you may have carried along &#8211; even compared to other DVCSs, it has a few unique features. But I wouldn&#8217;t want to trade them back in. The index is the most initially confusing, and it makes such perfect sense to me now that I miss it elsewhere.</p>

<p>It's pretty telling of the quality of a product when it's own developers don't use it.</p><p>Like many others, we choose to call it Visual SourceUnSafe, but must use it because it's the system that works best with Powerbuilder, sadly.  At least I can use something else for our web products....</p><p>If you only occasionally had to swear at VSS, consider yourself lucky!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>It is a sad, sad excuse for a source control system.</p><p>We used it at my last job for years, all the while know it was shit and meaning to switch to something else.</p><p>And in one of the most moronic moves in that company (the other being hiring Accenture), we switched to... Telelogic Synergy.</p><p>That, Ladies and Gentlemen, is SourceSafe done wrong on an Enterprise(tm) level.</p><p>Completely useless in so many, many ways, all in the name of an "audit trail" and "integration" with equally inept systems for requirements and such.</p><p>If they claim they have "reference customers", actually call them up and talk to the people using the system. Not(!) the build managers, or the people who brought it in, but the programmers actually forced to use it every day.</p><p>Or, in short: stay away!</p>

<p>We're actually looking at SourceGear.  Compatible with VSS, (seemingly) none of the pitfalls.  Curious to know if it works the same way with PB though.  Only gripe with SourceGear, so far, is the price for the amount of developers we have.</p>

<p>How do you like PowerBuilder? I've heard good things about it, and that was many many years ago.</p>

<p>It's nice, mostly<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)  Like most development tools, there's a laundry list of oddities you have to code around, but it's mature, stable, and easy to pick up.  I have never seen a faster way to put together a data-driven GUI app.  It's easy enough that our non-programmers can make report changes, too.</p><p>Highly recommend it if you want to do GUI apps on windows and not use Visual Studio.</p>
