<h1>Class::Std fun and my foolishness</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>Ever get embarrassed because as soon as you upload something to the CPAN you remember what you <em>should</em> have done?  I just did.  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Array-AsHash/">Array::AsHash 0.21</a> is now on its way to the CPAN because I handled the <tt>each</tt> iterator incorrectly.  Previously, I had this:</p>

<pre>while (my ($k, $v) = $array_as_hash->each) {
  ...
}

# as code reference
my $each = $array_as_hash->each;
while (my ($k, $v) = $each->()) {
  ...
}</pre>

<p>That was really, really stupid because the entire point of this module was to allow much richer interaction than a simple tied hash.  For example, let's say someone wants to invert this hash (which is perfectly acceptable because I allow references as keys) and they ask me to provide an <tt>invert</tt> method.  With a tied hash, you're stuck.  If I added this method (I will if someone needs it), you would be able to do this:</p>

<pre>my $array = Array::AsHash->new({array => [qw/one 1 two 2/]});
print $array->get('one'); # prints '1'
$array->invert;
print $array->get(1);     # prints 'one'</pre>

<p>It's useful things like that which make true objects preferable to tied variables.  I couldn't do that with the <tt>$each</tt> iterator because I was returning a code reference and that completely defeats my intent.  For example, what if I want to know if I'm on the first instance of the <tt>$each</tt> iterator?  You have to do this:</p>

<pre>my $each = $array_as_hash->each;
while (my ($k, $v) = $each->()) {
  if ($array_as_hash->first) {
    ...
  }
  ...
}</pre>

<p>However, if you had passed the iterator to another class, you'd also have to pass the <tt>Array::AsHash</tt> instance, too.  That's silly.  Yes, you could just pass the <tt>Array::AsHash</tt> instance, but if all your other class expects is an iterator conforming to a standard iterator interface, you may not want to do that.  Now I return an object blessed into the <tt>Array::AsHash::Iterator</tt> class.</p>

<pre>my $iter = $array_as_hash->each;
while (my ($k, $v) = $iter->next) {
  if ($iter->first) {
    ...
  }
  elsif ($iter->last) {
    ...
  }
}
$iter->reset_each; # if you need to reuse it but haven't iterated
                   # over all of the values
my $array_as_hash = $iter->parent; # if you need the original object back
</pre>

<p>It breaks backwards compatability, but since the <tt>Array::AsHash</tt> version which returns an iterator object has only been out for less than one day, I'm not too worried about that.</p>

<p>And what does <tt>Class::Std</tt> have to do with this?  Well, the <tt>each</tt> method looks similar to the following (simplified for clarity):</p>

<pre>sub each {
    my $self  = shift;
    my $ident = ident $self;

    my $each = sub {
        my $index = $current_index_for{$ident} || 0;
        my @array = $self->get_array;
        if ( $index >= @array ) {
            # end of iterator.  Reset and return false
            $self->reset_each;
            return;
        }
        my ( $key, $value ) = @array[ $index, $index + 1 ];
        $current_index_for{$ident} += 2;
        return ( $key, $value );
    };
 
    return $each->() if wantarray;

    return Array::AsHash::Iterator->new( {
        parent   => $self,
        iterator => $each,
    } );
}</pre>

<p>And that lets me define the iterator class as follows (again simplified for clarity):</p>

<pre>package Array::AsHash::Iterator;
use Class::Std;

{
    my %parent_of    :ATTR( :init_arg<parent> );
    my %iterator_for :ATTR( :init_arg<iterator> );

    sub next {
        my $self = shift;
        return $iterator_for{ident $self}->();
    }

    sub first {
        my $self = shift;
        return $parent_of{ident $self}->first;
    }

    sub last {
        my $self = shift;
        return $parent_of{ident $self}->last;
    }

    sub reset_each {
        my $self = shift;
        return $parent_of{ident $self}->reset_each;
    }

    sub parent {
        my $self = shift;
        return $parent_of{ident $self};
    }
}

1;</pre>

<p>The beauty of this is how well-encapsulated everything is.  These classes could be exceedingly fragile if they were hash-based and someone tried to reach inside in a mistaken attempt to improve performance.  Now I have no qualms about rearranging the internals and having complete confidence that I won't break anything.  I would almost say "hooray for inside-out objects!", but really, this is what you <em>expect</em> from good OO organization.</p>

<p>Side note:  for the time being, if you really need to invert a hash with this module, do this:</p>

<pre>my $array = Array::AsHash->new({array => [qw/one 1 two 2/]});
print $array->get('one'); # prints '1'

my @array = reverse $array->get_array;
my $reversed = Array::AsHash->new({array => \@array});
print $reversed->get(1);     # prints 'one'</pre></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t understand having <code>-&gt;first</code> and <code>-&gt;last</code> be methods of the main class.</p>

<p>I think you are trying to keep the innards of the iterator separate from the iterator class, right? That would be a worthwhile goal, but as it stands, your design means you can only ever have one iterator at a time per Array::AsHash instance. Someone&#8217;s going to get bitten by that at some point.</p>

<p>You could achieve separation on both levels by making two (or three) closures that close over the same variables, of which one is the iterator and the others are first/last state checkers.</p>

While encapsulation with Class::Std is nice indeed, it has a downside too. There seem to be non-trivial problem that has to do with the use of CHECK blocks.
See <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=14782" title="cpan.org">http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=14782</a cpan.org>.

Object::InsideOut is a new module that also provides comprehensive support for inside-out objects. It is faster, more flexible, supports threads including the sharing of objects between threads using threads::shared, and is usable under mod_perl.
