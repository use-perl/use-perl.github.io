<p><p>I've been getting a fair amount of email from folks about <a href="http://users.easystreet.com/ovid">my website</a> being gone.  Seems my ISP didn't email me about a billing issue, they sent regular mail to an old address in the US.  As a result, they shut the site down and deleted my content.  When they finally restored it, they forgot to create my home directory, hence I couldn't even FTP files.  I had my site rebuilt and ready to go, but was waiting on their support team to take care of this.</p>

<p>It's missing some images, but for the most part, it's all back.</p></p>

<h2>NSFW - link on your side panel</h2>

You might want to change the link to the 'ovidinexile' domain used on use.perl, as alarmingly I've just discovered it is definitely not safe for work, or even in the company of my other half!

<p>Thanks.  I let that domain expire because I never did anything with it.  Shame on me!</p>

<p>It would be nice anyway if you&#8217;d simply moved your site there&#8230; <code>users.$someisp.com/$loginname</code> looks really cheesy nowadays.</p>

<p>Yes, I should and just set up redirects, but squatters took "ovidinexile".  I guess I'm just lazy<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<h2>Missing images</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2007-03-16T22:58:28</h3>
It seems to me like you can get the missing images from the Wayback Machine's archive, for example: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060430155003/http://users.easystreet.com/ovid/personal/about.html" title="archive.org">about.html</a archive.org>.<br><br>You may have to enable Javascript for the links (and images) to work.<br><br>Get them while they're hot! The Wayback Machine is known to drop stuff after some months/years.
