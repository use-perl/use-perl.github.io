<p>Would you be interested in learning more about traits or do you think they're just another silly buzzword?  If you are interested in traits, what would it take to get you to start using them?</p>

<p>One thing I've noticed about traits is that most discussions of traits seem to revolve around examples which don't really match up with what people need in the real world.  This, curiously, is the same problem that many beginning OO examples have.  As a result, people learn about OO and often say "why bother?"  I think the same problem affects traits despite how useful they are.</p></p>

<p>I'll have to fall in the "I don't understand traits" camp.  I've heard of them, but I've never had a reason to study them before.  I have the paper you referenced and I'll read it soon.</p>
<p>To start using them I guess I need a reason to write some code and a few practical examples to see how they're implemented and used in Perl.</p>

I only heard of traits in the context of p6l. downloaded the "traits paper" but didn't put the time into getting head round it.  It looks vaguely like Java Interfaces but cleverer.<br><br>In Perl6 where it will be built in to the language and probably form part of standard idioms it seems well worth learning, for Perl5 it isn't yet on the top of my list of stuff to learn and it isn't worth the hassle of really grokking what they do and if there's an implementation (which I gather there is) yet.

I picked this because "multiple inheritance is good enough for me" wasn't an option.
<p>
I've never use traits. From what I read about it, it's yet another band-aid to supposedly fix what's wrong with multiple inheritance. IMO, there's nothing wrong with MI (except that people keep writing constructors that initialize objects, making it hard to do MI - but that's not the fault of MI, it's the programmers that need to meet Mr. Clue by Four). MI is good enough for me - no reason to use traits, or mixins, or what this weeks favoured band-aid is.</p>
