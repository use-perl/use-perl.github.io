<p><p>I'm not going to name the module because I don't want to slam the author, but I'm reinventing a CPAN wheel.  My boss, in looking at some of my code, knew the module that I was ignoring and asked me why.</p>

<p>"Because I can't understand the documentation."</p>

<p>The module actually looks like it would be useful, but try as I might, the docs may as well be written in Klingon.  I suspect that the module actually does far more than I need as the interface in some of the examples is very complicated, so I could use the "leaner, meaner version" argument.  But I still can't understand the docs.  If you're going to write a CPAN module, don't skimp on the documentation.  If I can't understand it, I probably won't use it.</p></p>

Name that module!
<p>
My vote for bad module of the day is <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/NATTIS/Ananke-Template-1.2/Template.pm" title="cpan.org">Ananke::Template</a cpan.org> which is just a bad imitation of TT.</p>

But that's not the <i>only</i> bad imitation of TT.  Look at <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/KASPER/HTML-KTemplate-1.02/" title="cpan.org">HTML::KTemplate</a cpan.org> as well.  Like most of the worst of TT mixed with HTML::Template.  Ick.

Ick. The only thing worse than inventing the wheel is doing it badly.
<p>
I may have to start scouring the depths of CPAN for a "bad module of the week". This may help the Schwartz factor a bit<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

It would probably be nice to give the authors a chance<br>to clean up their module before announcing their shame.<br> <br>Otherwise you'll just become loathed =)<br>

Along these lines, I nominate Text::Macros.  It has documentation more or less sufficient for what it does, but what it does is crummy.  I think the author released it (four versions!) without ever bothering to finish it.

<p>No can do.  The module itself appears to be useful and some checking around reveals that others are using it (though not very widely).  If it was a bad module, I don't mind calling a spade a spade.  I just want to be sure that I'm being decent and not trashing a good module just because someone didn't do a good job of communicating.  Let's face it, programmers who write great code are often known for being less than diligent about their docs<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Amusingly, I found a tutorial for using this module that was even worse.  I went back, read the docs again and am even more convinced than ever that this module is overkill for our needs, so I don't feel too bad about rewriting it (it only took me about 3 hours).</p>

<i>I don't feel too bad about rewriting it (it only took me about 3 hours)</i> <br> <br>Yeah, the great thing about Perl is how easy it is to write stuff.  I think that is an important reason for the success of CPAN -- it is easy to add stuff, because it's easy to write in the first place!  Syntax *is* important (take that, lisp fans)!<br>

Is this, by any chance, NetAddr::IP?<p>

Not being a native english speaker, and having a tutorial online at <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/" title="perlmonks.org">The Perl Monastery</a perlmonks.org>, it would not surprise me.</p><p>

If it is indeed one of my modules, I would want to know.</p><p>

<p>No worries.  It's an entirely different module.</p>

Hi,<br/><br/>Yeah, is one imitation of TT, but, Ananke::Template use only 200k of memory and TT use 2M, imagine 100 modperl using with persistent connection... Anake::Template is very very very speedy and small.<br/><br/>Now i have other module, NTS::Template (Ananke::Template rewrite), is more stable, speedy and use less memory... but documentation is bad<br/><br/>my english is bad<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br/><br/>bye

<h2>Writing docs</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TorgoX/">TorgoX</a> on 2002-10-29T00:04:13</h3>
A lot of people's model of writing a module is to work on a module until
they're absolutely sick of it, and then they're just about to release
it, and they think "ugh, I guess I'd better write some docs".  Not a
great frame of mind to be in for writing docs.

<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-10-30T19:15:13</h3>
I am not the very model of a modern extreme programmer, but I try to document the API was I go, and that is most of the battle right there.  I should probably write tests too, but, well, I, um, have to go eat dinner<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...

<h2>Contact the author</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-10-31T15:22:57</h3>
I'm notorious for having bad docs for my modules, so I wouldn't be entirely surprised if it was one of my modules you were talking about (and I wouldn't be offended either<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>But you should contact the author. He might have just dropped the ball a bit, and would be more willing to get started again if he got feedback that someone wanted to use his code.
