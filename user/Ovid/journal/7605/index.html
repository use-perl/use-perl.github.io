<p><blockquote>If I heard a voice from Heaven say 'Live without loving',<br>
I'd beg off.  Girls are such exquisite hell. -- Ovid (the original)</blockquote>

<p>I don't understand the weird stuff I always get into with women as it always seems to be feast or famine with me.  It used to be that I couldn't pick up a woman if she had handles.  However, I got engaged at one point and women started crawling out of the woodwork.  One even showed up at my office wearing a waaaaay too tight t-shirt that read "Steelworkers do it hard" and she asked me point blank if I loved my fianc&eacute;e and if I wanted to go out (I told her 'no').  Years later, after my divorce, the famine was back in full force.</p>

<p>I generally don't meet women too easily, but when I do, others still seem to pop up.  With my last two girlfriends, I wound up getting surprise emails from old flames or phone calls out of the blue.  Of course, I have to let them know that being friends is fine, but I'm spoken for -- yet I can't help but wonder how the heck women seemed to have developed this psychic ability to just <em>know</em> when a guy has a partner.  Given a rather established, if somewhat bizarre, pattern in my life, I was rather nervous on Friday when I met a charming lady at a club and she and I agreed that we would meet the following night at another club.  I liked her and I wanted to know her better but I knew trouble was there, hiding just out of my sight.  That's just the way things work for me.</p>

<p>So last night I head to the club and she's not there.  I'm sitting down chatting with friends, not really paying attention to anyone else, when this attractive blond catches my eye.  I walk up and start chatting with her, get her phone number in just a couple of minutes (how the heck did I pull that off?!?!) and then she mentions that she doesn't know too many people there because she's still going to school and just started going out to clubs.</p>

<p>That's when the alarm bells started sounding and a voice in my head was screaming "<strong>Danger, Will Robinson, danger!</strong>", which I found pretty odd as my name is not Will Robinson.</p>

<p>I asked her age.  She told me.  I did the math.  I graduated from high school before she even hit kindergarten.  Uh oh.</p>

<p>Later, another woman walked up to me and asked me if I used to work for "Company X".  I did and it turns out that she knew my name and we were <em>sort of</em> co-workers, even though we were in different departments.  She also knows several of my friends, but somehow our paths never crossed until last night.  She and I hit it off fairly well and then her friend chatting with me and was very friendly.  What the heck?  Her friend and I danced a little, my former co-worker didn't talk to me again, her friend wandered off, the attractive blond ignored me after that and the woman that I wanted to know better never showed up.</p>

<p>Now I'm sitting here now with a piece of paper with a phone number on it.  It's probably worthless at this point.  Truly girls are exquisite hell.</p></p>
