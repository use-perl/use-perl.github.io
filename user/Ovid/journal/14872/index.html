<p><p>I was writing some Inline::C code when I became stuck trying to figure out why the following kept segfaulting:</p>

<pre>string = SvPV(elem, PL_na);
    if (looks_like_number(string)) {</pre>

<P>That was buried in a much larger snippet and it took a long time to narrow down.  Specifically, I put print statements after every line to determine what was failing.  Naturally, as soon as I saw that I was getting a segfault at "looks_like_number", I decided to read the docs (<tt>perldoc perlapi</tt>) where I saw that function, and not just scan them.  That function takes a scalar, not a string.</p>

<pre>if (looks_like_number(elem)) {
    string = SvPV(elem, PL_na);</pre>

<p>Of course I discovered this only after I had posted a message to the Inline list.  Had I taken the time to properly debug everything and narrow it down to the correct line, I would have seen the problem immediately.  I find that when I program in C, I am much more likely to throw my hands up in despair than figure out what the problem actually is.  I need to stop that.</p></p>
