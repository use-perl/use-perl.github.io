<p><p>We received a resume from someone with "Pearl" experience.  It turns out that his recruitment agency thought it would be useful to correct his misspellings ...</p></p>

<h2>&quot;Pearl&quot; experience</h2>

And here I was expecting that they were sending you candidates with jewelry and clam experience.



<h2>It could be worse...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jtrammell/">jtrammell</a> on 2006-11-02T20:00:32</h3>
I once saw a job description that involved "Peril" programming.  "I can't, it's too perilous!"



<h2>When The Revolution Comes...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2006-11-02T20:38:09</h3>
<p>Recruitment agents will be first against the wall! Though there may be a long line of other agents in the queue with them...</p>



<h2>Pearl</h2>

Are you sure it wasn't really <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEARL_programming_language" title="wikipedia.org">PEARL</a wikipedia.org>?



<h2>....recruiters</h2>

i recently hopped back into the 'find a job game'.  updated my resume on dice.com -- within hours my email was litterally spammed with all sorts of various "opportunities".  funny thing, almost half of them were caught by gmail's spam filter.<br/><br/>being a 24 year old, i was extremely delighted to be offered so many Sr and technical lead positions.  Apparently, my 1.5 years of experience was qualifying me for the said positions.<br/><br/>sad but true -- most "recruiters" are merely running search bots on moster/dice/ and using mass mailers.  low-tech script kiddies imo.
