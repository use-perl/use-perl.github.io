<p><p>While working on the migration path towards 5.8.1, I find myself constantly stumbling over minor problems that are causing big problems.  For a while, I've been trying to figure out why this weird pseudo-hash which is being exported all over the place (aargh!  Encapsulation is being violated for performance reasons) isn't behaving nicely.  As it turns out, it's because <tt>Class::MethodMaker</tt> has been subclassed to implement chained mutators, but the actual implementation overrode a private method whose behavior has changed.</p>

<p>In the process of debugging, I've tried to run the code under both 5.6.1 and 5.8.1 and <tt>confess()</tt> a bunch of <tt>Data::Dumper</tt>'ed data -- only to discover that both <tt>Carp</tt> and <tt>Data::Dumper</tt> have had their output formatting altered enough to make diffs rather problematic.</p>

<p>I now have most of the code running, though.  I just need to track down one program runs which fine under 5.6.1 and segfaults under 5.8.1 ...</p></p>

<h2>Diffing Data::Dumper</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/melopt/">melopt</a> on 2003-10-17T22:18:50</h3>
regarding diff's and Data::Dumper, there is a option in there to sort the keys of the hash dump's.<br/><br/>It works for me...

or use YAML ;

<p>I'm familiar with ordering the has keys.  The problem stems from this note in the CHANGES file for Data::Dumper:</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>=item 2.11&nbsp; (unreleased)<br> <br>C&lt;0&gt; is now dumped as such, not as C&lt;'0'&gt;.</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>That's the problem that's killing me, but there's probably a simple setting that I overlooked<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>As a side note, the segfault was being caused by my having a PERL5LIB environment variable silently pointing to my personal CPAN directory.  That directory has a version of Storable compiled for 5.6.1 which, as we know, is not binary compatible with 5.8.1.</p>
