<p><p>First note:  sitting in a hotel room and am about to leave for the airport.  Due to me being rather foolish, I agreed to being booked on <em>three</em> separate flights (SeaTac to JFK, JFK to Dublin and Dublin to London) on three separate airlines all with the intent of lowering my costs.  It's saved me a bundle of money, but I should have paid an extra couple of hundred dollars to avoid the headache.</p>

<p>Second note:  my Yahoo! mail filters appear to have broken for several Perl mailing lists and I'm getting tons of mail in my inbox.  What a hassle.  Must look into this.</p>

<p>Off to London and then to Nottingham by next week.</p></p>

With both the airlines &amp; Nottingham<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Are you in London this week? There's a london.pm meeting on Thursday. The Founders Arms on Bankside. People will be there from about 6pm.<br>

<p>I was to be in London Wednesday afternoon.  Now, because American Airlines screwed up royally (and gave me the runaround about it), I'm going to be delayed a day and am only guaranteed to get as far as Dublin.  I have a flight booked from Dublin to London, but because of what happened, there's no guarantee that British Airways will honor it (long story that I will be posting a <em>long</em> rant about later).  Right now, I feel lucky that American Airlines even comped me a hotel room.  I'm really, really ticked off at them right now and I doubt that I will ever fly with them again.</p>

I've read the rant. What a nightmare for you.<br><br>But if you make it as far as London by Thursday evening then there will be a group of people in the Founders Arms who will be only too happy to buy you beer and swap airline horror stories with you.

Stories like this remind me why I am more than willing to pay a little extra for direct flights.<br><br>Good luck getting to London. If that doesn't work out so well at least the weather is nice in Dublin this week.
