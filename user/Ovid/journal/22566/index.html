<p><p>I was going to release a module named "Aliased" which would alias long class names to short ones.  However, it's only for OO modules , it sort of alters compile-time behavior so one might think of it as a pragma, and "class" is not a keyword.  Thus, I could do this:</p>

<pre>use class 'My::Company::Namespace::Customer';
use class 'My::Company::Namespace::Preferred::Customer', as => 'Preferred';

my $cust = Customer->new;
my $pref = Preferred->new;</pre>

<p>My immediate reaction was "no!", we don't want to do that.  Then I realized I couldn't think of a reason why.  Can you?  I certainly don't want to release that and  make people mad (though Theory pointed out that "class" doesn't indicate that anything's getting exported to the current namespace).</p>

<p>Side note:  the "as" key in the  import list is important because there's a separate "import" key in case you need to pass args to the module's <tt>import()</tt> method.</p></p>

<p>That's an excellent idea!  Now when people submitting requests to modules@perl.org complain that they want their pet module to have a short name  cos it saves typing in their programs (at the expense of being meaningful in the global hierarchy) this can provide a solution.</p>

<p>It's also handy when a module changes its name &#8212; just change the <code>use</code> line, and leave other references to the class alone.</p>

<h2>Perl or Java?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2005-01-04T22:30:51</h3>
On the one hand, good job.  You <i>should</i> beat your programming
language until it fits your domain.
<p>
On the other hand, it's Java all over again.  Every time I look at a
Java program, I see statements like <tt>import java.io.*</tt> and the
like.  A few lines later, I see references to classes I've never seen
before from one package or another, and I don't know where to go when
I'm looking up methods on some interface like XMLReader or some class
like HashMap.  Because the package prefixes are stripped, I've lost all
context as to what's what.  I wouldn't have such a severe reaction if I
programmed in Java all the time, but that's like saying the way to stop
making your head hurt is to keep banging it until you can't feel the pain.
</p><p>
This pattern is not an absolute good or bad thing.  You can't get
anything done in Java without using dozens of classes from at least half
a dozen packages, so figuring out which class belongs in which
package just by reading the source code is more difficult than it
should be.  So maybe the pattern isn't bad, maybe it just turns
sour in Java where you can't get up to stretch your legs without
touching 7 interfaces and 15 classes from some or all of the packages
you've imported.
</p><p>
So just keep that in mind.  If your code is using two or three classes
that are all explicitly aliased, it's probably a good thing.  But keep
the counter example of Java in your mind, so you don't repeat that
pattern-gone-awry.</p>

<p>This is somewhat different from the Java model (<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=292009" title="perlmonks.org">I had considered implementing that but I abandoned the idea as causing more problems than it solved</a perlmonks.org>).  Java is frustrating because, as you point out, you can silently bring in tons of namespaces and not know their origin.  However, class.pm does this one module at a time.  You can always  glance at the code at the top of the package to see where the  package comes from.</p>

I think I'd really, really hate that part... I'd want to be able to say "only alias what I tell you to alias".<br> <br>Kinda ugly (just thrown out as a starting block) but how about:<blockquote><div> <tt>use class ('My::Company::Namespace::Preferred::Customer', as =&gt; 'Preferred');</tt> </div></blockquote>or even:<blockquote><div> <tt>use class;<br>my $alias = new class;<br>$alias-&gt;add('My::Company::Namespace::Preferred::Customer', 'Preferred');<br>
&nbsp; <br>... later (if desired/needed)...<br>
&nbsp; <br>$alias-&gt;remove('My::Company::Namespace::Preferred::Custome r');</tt> </div></blockquote>Just some thoughts... (and I have no idea where the space before the 'r' in customer is coming from)

<p>It only aliases what you tell it to alias, so no worries there.  Also, the entire point of this is to keep things really, really simple.  Dirt simple.  Making it all OO defeats that.  All this module really does (mostly) is to use the package in question and then insert a sub into your namespace that returns the name of the  module.</p>

You might want to avoid using class so that if/when someone writes (or maybe someone has already written) a Perl6:: module that supports <tt>class</tt> as a keyword folks won't be inviting confusion by trying to use both that module and yours.<br> <br>Obviously "don't use that name, because someone else might" could be said of any name, but I think a potentially very popular name like 'class' might be worth extra caution.<br> <br>Then again, if you call it 'class', someone who hates the name can write a thin wrapper calling it whatever they want instead.<br> <div><nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>/me shrugs</tt> </div> <br>-matt

<p>Hi Matt.  I'm going to call it "aka.pm" because it's short and that's a name that received fairly decent support on the module author's list.  I was also hesitant about the Perl 6 issue, oddly enough.  I'll probably have it uploaded in the next day or two unless there's some strenous objection from the PAUSE admins.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/perrin/">perrin</a> on 2005-01-05T05:49:25</h3>
Sorry Ovid, but this is an abomination.  It kind of sums up many of the problems with Perl culture: obsession with syntax over utility, willful use of obscure features like using the import list for other things, and a desire to make everything REALLY short.  Give the module a normal name, call the alias method like a normal method, and give intermediate perl programmers a chance in hell of understanding your code.  Otherwise, it belongs in Acme::.

<p>I fear that you are in the minority. Though many have objected to the name -- leading me to change it -- you're the only person who has objected to the idea of the module.</p>

<p>The inspiration for this code was a module named "Aliased" that <a href="http://www.rentrak.com/" title="rentrak.com">Rentrak</a rentrak.com> uses extensively in their code.  (They have graciously allowed me to duplicate the functionality of the code.)  The reason I mention this is because while the code is new, the interface is not and it has withstood the test of time for very large scale systems (enterprise-class, if you can forgive the buzzword.)</p>

<p>The programmers who work there will all quite happily tell you that this is a module they can't live without.   Given  how very useful it has proven to be I want it for  my own projects.  I'd be more hesitant if I didn't know how popular it is with the programmers who have used it.  Maybe this is one of those "it sounds weird but it really works" ideas? (Dynamic typing being another example<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I think you're misunderstanding me.  I don't object to the module, only to the interface.  I think it should have a simple interface with no obscure import() subversion and no pragma-like class names.  The concept of aliasing is clear enough -- it's that API you came up with that I don't like.



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:please, yes</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2005-01-05T06:43:39</h3>
<p>Yes, I did misunderstand you.  However, even though there are a couple of people who objected to the interface, I fear you're still in the minority.  As I mentioned previously, I and a number of other programmers have been using a virtually identical interface for so long without any problems (and with strong benefits) that I'm still quite comfortable with the interface.</p>

<p>You are someone who I generally pay extra attention to given  my respect for your abilities.  In this case, I must disagree due to extensive personal experience.</p>

I was going to post a flame about how the whole point of programming
language design is to obsess over syntax in the name of achieving
greater utility.  That's what gave us idioms like 'open or die' and
foreach loops over hand-compiling tail recursive forms.
<p>
But I see that your clarification, and yes, the abuse of the import list
is quite horrid.
</p><p>
Perl is a dynamic language.  There's no reason why the magic fiddling
<i>must</i> happen at compile time, nor is there any reason why it the
aliasing <i>must</i> use a <tt>use</tt> statement to fire.  This sketch
should work, work clearly, work properly and not be overly abusive to perl:</p><blockquote><div> <tt>use MyCorp::MyApp::Customer qw(...);<br>use MyCorp::MyApp::Preferred::Customer qw(...);<br> <br>use PackageAlias qw(make_alias);<br>make_alias(MyCorp::MyApp::Customer&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; =&gt; "Customer");<br>make_alias(MyCorp::MyApp::Preferred::Customer =&gt; "Preferred");<br> <br>my $cust = new Customer;<br>my $pref = new Preferred;</tt> </div></blockquote>Thoughts?

<p>Well, my thought is pretty straight-forward:  the current  code I have implemented not only works, it fits very  naturally with current Perl syntax.  I can't say that I like the syntax of  how I handled importing, but that's not the common case.  The important thing is that the common case be handled easily.   The more programming people do, the more they want the common things to be short-n-sweet.  </p>

<p>My code is ready to be uploaded  and I'm merely waiting for last minute objections from the modules@cpan.org list.  If you can make a convincing argument why my solution is more abusive and how your solution is better, I'm willing to hear it.  However, just  <em>saying</em> that my abusing importing is a bad thing doesn't mean that it's a bad thing (no offense.)  And just to give you a fair shot at making your case, here's the code I wrote:</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>package aka;<br>$VERSION = '0.1';<br> <br>use strict;<br> <br>sub import {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my ($class, $package, %properties) = @_;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; require Carp &amp;&amp; Carp::croak("You must supply a package name to aka")<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unless defined $package;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $alias&nbsp; = $properties{as} || _get_aka($package);<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my @import;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; if (exists $properties{import}) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $import = $properties{import};<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $import = [$import] unless 'ARRAY' eq ref $import;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; @import = @$import;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; unshift @import =&gt; $package;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $callpack = caller(0);<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; local $SIG{'__DIE__'};<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; eval "package $callpack; require $package; sub $alias { '$package' }";<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; die $@ if $@;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $import_method = UNIVERSAL::can($package, 'import');<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; @_ = @import;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; goto $import_method if $import_method;<br>}<br> <br>sub _get_aka {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $package = shift;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $package&nbsp; &nbsp; =~ s/.*(?:::|')//;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return $package;<br>}<br> <br>1;</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>The only reservation I have is about my use of <tt>UNIVERSAL::can</tt>.  It's possible that a package (or a subclass prior to <tt>UNIVERSAL</tt>) has implemented its own <tt>&amp;can</tt> method, but I think this is so obscure  a case that I'm not too worried about it.  On the other hand, I did allow for single quote marks in package names<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I like that API much better.  My beef with the original API is that it uses pragma-like names and a non-obvious use of import (which is unfortunately catching on because of Test::More), and all for the sake of syntax rather than added functionality.  To me, it looks like a disregard for the larger effects on the community, i.e. if everyone did crazy stuff like this to get a particular syntax for their modules, CPAN would be a total disaster.  I have also seen this kind of thing get people into trouble, as in the dangerous try/catch syntax of the otherwise useful Error.pm module.  <p>The need to learn lots of little syntaxes is the kind of thing that people complain about when they are trying to pick up Perl after knowing another language.  I think it should be avoided when possible.</p>

Like the idea.  The name not so good.  Two objections.  One: there's got to be a better use for class.pm.  Two: it doesn't say anything about the aliasing/shortening aspect of the module.  If I was to guess what class.pm was I would guess it was something for writing a class.



<h2>Don't see the point.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2005-01-05T13:23:30</h3>
<p>Why does this need an entire module?</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>use constant Customer =&gt; 'My::Company::Namespace::Customer';<br>use constant Preferred =&gt; 'My::Company::Namespace::Preferred::Customer';<br> <br>my $cust = Customer-&gt;new;<br>my $pref = Preferred-&gt;new;</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>I've used this&hellip; not-even-a-trick on several occasions, FWIW.</p>

<p>Note how it makes no difference in the actual code, just makes effective use of what's already in the core. (And you could even do without <code>constant.pm</code> using prototyped subs, but that is too opaque for my taste.)</p>
