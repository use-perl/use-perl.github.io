<p><p>So my fiancÃÂ©e was rather curious about what I do for a living, so she started researching Perl Training companies.  Part of this is with the idea that, long-term, we might consider launching a Perl consultancy firm (initially focused on training).  Given that her background is legal (she has a Masters in French law), project management, communications and political consulting, it's fair to say that she has plenty of business background but no technical background. As a result, she was looking at various sites with the eye of someone who might hire them to do Perl training.  She found one, and only one, that she would consider.  That was <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a>.  Why?</p>

<ul>
  <li>The site made clear the competitive advantage of Perl</li>
  <li>It was easy to find the information she wanted</li>
  <li>It was easy to read the information</li>
  <li>It was pleasant to read</li>
  <li>Perl looked "sexy" (her words) via the presentation and explanation</li>
  <li>The Web site actually looked professional (but only compared to other Perl training sites)</li>
  <li>They listed the companies they've worked for, making it clear that Perl is ubiquitous</li>
  <li>There were biographies which made it clear that their people were competent</li>
</ul>

<p>Make of that what you will, but if you comment, don't insult my fiancÃÂ©e :)  Remember, she's looking at this from the point of view of someone considering Perl for their company.  And just to be clear, she's looked at many, many Web sites of companies offering Perl training (and if you know Perl, you know some of those names).</p></p>

It's worth noting that those pictures are only indicative of what our classes look like on <i>Teach Like a Pirate Day</i>, and you have to book in advance for that.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

<blockquote><div><p>"She found one, and only one, that she would consider."</p></div></blockquote><p>

That was kind of the point I was trying to share with folks in a recent rant called "<a href="http://blog.newint.org/tech/2009/10/13/perl-in-your-city/" title="newint.org">Perl in your city</a newint.org>." It's really hard to find good hand-on Perl learning opportunities to recommend.

Hats off to the folks at Perl Training Australia for the work they are doing, which is excellent.

Phillip.</p>

<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.. after twenty years in that seamy business called government IT (yep, one of the many many things governments _*%!-up), I suggest that Perl Training Australia (on the basis of their helpful Perl TiPs and their free docco) are not only a very good Perl trainer, but that their service is at least as good as that provided by large multinational computer and software companies.
<p>
I'd think their manuals are excellent.
</p><p>
If they see their way to produce a Perl Pattern book, I'd definitely buy a copy.</p>

<p>This is depressing reading. I'm currently trying to promote some <a href="http://mag-sol.com/train/public/" title="mag-sol.com">public Perl courses</a mag-sol.com> in London next month and it's proving incredibly hard to get Google to give any kind of importance to my pages.</p><p>Of course, might be a victim of my own success here. Many of the top results from a Google search for "<a href="http://www.google.ie/search?q=perl+training+london" title="google.ie">perl training london</a google.ie>" are about the free <a href="http://mag-sol.com/train/teachin/" title="mag-sol.com">Perl Teach-In</a mag-sol.com> that I ran two years ago.</p><p>I'm going to have to learn something about SEO, aren't I?</p>

<p>She actually didn't see your site until last night.  You never showed up in her Web searches (she was largely searching for "Perl training uk", I think) and I had to send a link to her.  Yeah, SEO is important<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:/</p>
