<p><p>I've been glancing through some of my journal entries and noticed that I have had a really negative tone lately.  I dislike that, but lately in my life, when it rains it frickin' has a hurricane.</p>

<p>Okay, so grandma is dead.  I went to help plan her funeral and afterwards I got a call from a friend to go and hang out.  There were a bunch of my friends there when I arrived, we drank some beer, soaked in a hot tub and had a generally good evening.  I am very grateful that I have good friends who care about me.</p>

<p>My girlfriend, on the other hand, was absolutely livid that I would hang out with my friends.  I had called her to let her know that I would have more free time than previously expected and could we make some time together?  When I got to her place, she ripped me to shreds for hanging out with some friends instead of her.  I got up, wished her a good life and haven't looked back.</p>

<p>I need to get a dog so someone can run over it.</p>

<p>Looking on the bright side, things can't get much worse.</p></p>

<h2>Something I Had Always Done</h2>

When awful things happen to me, I try to imagine how Douglas Adams would be writing it if I were a character in one of his books.  I know _Hitchhiker's_ is ubiquitous, but I prefer imagining myself in one of the Dirk Gently books.
