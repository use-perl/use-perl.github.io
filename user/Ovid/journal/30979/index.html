<p><p>Me know nuthin' 'bout objects.</p>

<p>There are days when I feel really, really stupid.  Today's stupidity has actually been going on for several weeks, simmering in the back of my mind.  I just received a bug report for TAPx::Parser from Torsten Sch&ouml;nfeld.  Seems that my parser doesn't like blank lines in the output.  After some debugging, it became clear that the following is a big bucket of suck:</p>

<pre>sub next {
    my $self = shift;
    if (@{$self->_m_tokens}) {
        return shift @{$self->_m_tokens};
    }
    if ($self->_current_chunk) {
        if ( $self->_stream_started ) {
            $self->_start_tap(0);
        }
        else {
            $self->_start_tap(1);
            $self->_stream_started(1);
        }
    }
    my $next_chunk = $self->_stream->next;
    if (! $self->_current_chunk() && $next_chunk ) {
        $self->_current_chunk($next_chunk);
        return $self->next;
    }
    unless ( defined $next_chunk ) {
        $self->_end_tap(1);
    }
    if ( defined $self->_current_chunk ) {
        my @current_tokens = map {
            my $result = TAPx::Parser::Results->new($_);
            $self->_validate($result);
            $result;
        } $self->_lex($self->_current_chunk());
        my $token = shift @current_tokens;
        push @{$self->_m_tokens()} => @current_tokens;
        $self->_current_chunk($next_chunk);
        return $token;
    }
    $self->_finish;
    return;
}</pre>

<p>What the hell is that?  I can barely follow it and I wrote it!  I hated writing it at the time and I hate it even worse, now.  But that's because I was really, really stupid and let a known design flaw remain in my parser.  I didn't have my responsibilities appropriately distributed.</p>

<P>When I said at the beginning "me know nuthin'", though this is a bit of a slam on me, it's also sound advice about objects.  I shouldn't know a damn thing about 'em.  I should beg them for information and tell them what they want to know.  That's it.  I shouldn't know anything about their internals or, for that matter, their state.  However, in the above code, I was actually trying to track the state of an iterator or stream.  I wasn't reaching in, I was trying to track it externally.  That was stupid.</p>

<p>If you really, really need to know the state of something and you can't ask it, you've probably got a design flaw.  In the iterator code, I copied it almost verbatim from Test::Harness::Iterator.  I'm sure that the Test::Harness code is fine for its needs, but it's completely innapropriate for mine.  In fact, my subconscious was even trying to tell me I was being a moron because prior to that method you find the following comment:</p>

<pre># all of this annoying current and next chunk stuff is to ensure that we
# really do know if we're at the beginning or end of a stream.</pre>

<p>And that horror is all because I didn't implement <tt>first</tt> and <tt>last</tt> methods for my iterator.  Well, I've now finished rewriting the iterator, but it's on my computer at home and I'm at work, so I won't be able to upload right away.  While I haven't actually implemented it, a first pass at rewriting the <tt>next</tt> method would look something like this:</p>

<pre>sub next {
    my $self = shift;
    my $stream = $self->_stream;
    my $next = $stream->next;
    $self->_start_tap( $stream->first ? 1 : 0 );
    if ( $stream->last ) {
        $self->_finish;
        return;
    }
    
    # this is a tiny oversimplification
    my $token = TAPx::Parser::Results->new( $self->_lex($next) );
    $self->_validate($token);
    return $token;
}</pre>

<p>That's <em>much</em> cleaner.  If I had gone ahead and fixed this problem when I first knew about it, I wouldn't have had two serious bug reports about this method in the space of five days.</p></p>

<p>Those methods should probably be called <tt>is_first</tt> and <tt>is_last</tt> instead, though.</p>

<p>Agreed.  I'll go make that change.</p>
