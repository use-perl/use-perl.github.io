<p><p>I finally realized why I was being <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=503758">stupid about how I was testing HTML and XML</a>.  The realization was so blindingly obvious that, in retrospect, I'm embarrased that I didn't appreciate it before.    You see, if you squint, HTML and XML documents are instances of objects.  I don't care about the whitespace, the attribute order, or if the nav links are at the top, bottom, left, etc.  What I care about is the information these documents present and the things I can do with them.</p>

<p>When I test an object's API, I shouldn't care if it's implemented with a hashref, inside out objects or RPC calls.  I should only care if it does what it promises.  Can I click a link and go to the correct page?  Does it even have that link?  Is the title correct?  Those are the things I care about.  I'm embarrassed that I've wasted so much time testing rapidly changing internals when the things I really needed to test weren't changing that much.</p>

<p>Realizations like that really hammer home how much I have to learn.</p></p>

We're getting a disgusting amount of functionality out of this teeny-tiny program I wrote called simple_scan. It basically lets nearly anybody write TAP-based tests vs. anything you can talk to over HTTP.<p>You use <i>test specs</i> to tell it what you want:<code><br><a href="http://yahoo.com/" title="yahoo.com">http://yahoo.com/</a yahoo.com><nobr> <wbr></nobr>/Yahoo!/ Y branded properly<br></code>Run through simple_scan, that generates a nice Perl test that uses Test::WWW::Simple to see if the regex matches the page. Dead simple.</p><p>It actually turns out that a lot of what we're worried about is "is the content there and in the right place on the page". And simple_scan, along with a little debugging code the demarcates the different sections of the page, lets us test boatloads of stuff without a line of code being written.</p><p>This is important because our developers are harried PHP'ers who want to get the work out and not switch channels between two languages *just* different enough to cause problems, and because our project managers are generally people who know what the product is supposed to do, but aren't really programmers.</p><p>So we have a nice tool that works for everybody. I'm not going into plugins and so on because I'm planning a presentation for next year's conferences on how this dead-simple approach is paying off big.</p><p>See App::SimpleScan on CPAN if you want to play with it. More plugins on the way.</p>

I should break down that test spec:<br><ol> <li>URL to access</li><li>regex to match against it</li><li> <ul> <li>Y - match it</li><li>N - don't match it</li><li>TY - TODO, should eventually match</li><li>TN - TODO, should eventually not match</li></ul></li> <li>comment<br></li></ol><br>And it's all TAP, so you can use Test::Harness to write tools to summarize. Should have lots more by CFP time.

<p>Sounds like you want something like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-WWW-Mechanize/" title="cpan.org">Test::WWW::Mechanize</a cpan.org>, but without the Mechanize part.</p>



<h2>Please clarify...</h2>

What are you doing now ? Which tools are helping you (Test::WWW::Mechanize, no more XPath based tests etc...)  ?<br><br>By the way, were you testing the HTML page itself or the behaviour of the application generating the HTML page ?<br><br>Thanks!
