<p><p>I was looking at crud like the following:</p>

<pre>$dbh->prepare('SELECT foo, bar ...

$dbh->prepare('SELECT and, more ...
$dbh->prepare('SELECT of, this, crap ...</pre>

<p>Multiple prepare statements in a row?  What gives?</p>

<p>If you think it's acceptable to write a line of code that's much more than 80 characters long <em>and</em> you think it's OK to have a statement modifier at the end where they are hanging off the right side of my terminal window, you desperately need to have all of your fingers run through a sausage grinder and sit at home and reflect on your sins.</p>

<pre>$dbh->prepare('SELECT foo, bar ...') if $1 == $bar;
$dbh->prepare('SELECT quux, bar ...') if $in_dev;
$dbh->prepare('SELECT this, that ...') unless $i'm_on_drugs;
$dbh->prepare('SELECT and, more ...') if !$undulating;
$dbh->prepare('SELECT of, this, crap ...') if $bar == 3;</pre>

<p>There are so many things wrong with that, I can't even begin to understand how the programmer ever got hired.  Fortunately, this is, once again, legacy code that we've complete permission to fix.</p></p>

With folk who live on terminals maximised horizontally, so they end up with 400char wide lines.<br><br>No excuse of course...

<p>These are the same people who don't understand what's wrong with 500 line subroutines which do 23 unrelated things.</p>

Indeed.<br/><br/>I have to be much more careful with advice like "if it doesn't fit on half a screen it's too complex" for folk have a display with more characters than I had pixels when I were a lad<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

The code in the top level post is bad but even if the guy had a normal sized terminal going it still  would have been bad code, just easier to see it all.

<p>My PuTTY session is set up to start at 157 x 60 which after screen is up and running gives me 157 x 58 and fills the entire display. Are you saying that more display real estate equates to bad code?

</p><p>People with more display real estate shouldn't be lumped in with the clueless masses who churn out chum. I don't write the 500 line subroutines that do 23 different things.  I find myself writing long lines of code all too often but that's what perltidy is for.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>As a general rule of thumb, I've seen that the longer individual lines of code are, the worse the code quality.  However, that's only a rule of thumb and certainly not a hard and fast rule.  What's important here is whether a programmer can look at a particular bit of code and understand what's going on.  The "larger" the code (wider or taller), the lower the chance of that happening.</p>

<p>If a programmer is writing code that other programmers will have to work on -- now or in the future -- it's even more imperative to follow reasonable guidelines which most people will accept.  A 76 to 80 character width for lines is one of those guidelines<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

No matter who runs perltidy the results will end up looking the same (unless they explicitly override the options on the command line).

I hit submit too soon.

<p>I was fairly certain that you would say something similar to what you actually did.  I wanted you to say it though (if that makes any sense to you).</p>

<p>I refuse to break my code at unnatural spots just to fit an obsolete limitation. 1024&#xd7;768 is ubiquitous and permits much wider lines than 80 chars.</p>

<p>That doesn&#x2019;t mean I make my lines gratuitously long. I <em>usually</em> stay a good deal below 80 chars, because my code style is generous with whitespace and has plenty of natural breaking points &#x2013; very deliberately so. Eg. were I to write the exact same code as your example, then each line would be broken before the <code>if</code>, which would follow on an indented line of its own. The result is that I run up to 95 columns or so with any frequency, maybe every once in a couple dozen lines; up to 115ish maybe once or twice per file, if even that often; the most I&#x2019;ve had more than two or three times is in the 130s or so. I do try to find a way to keep line lengths down, I just refuse to bend over backwards to uphold the rule.</p>

<p>And in any case if I ended up with a long sequence of conditional bits of code, all with different conditions, like what you have there, I&#x2019;d ask myself whether there really is no better way to write that. Code consisting entirly of short conditional bits is every bit as painful to read as code full of <tt>GOTO</tt>s.</p>
