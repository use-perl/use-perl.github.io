<p><p>Warning:  this is a rant and it's very political.  You might want to just ignore it.</p>

<p>I was at the Portland, Oregon peace rally yesterday.  Estimates on attendance vary quite a bit.  The Oregonian, our local daily, always reports lower numbers for turnouts compared to other sources.  The Portland Police Department stopped issuing estimates because every second guesses them.  In any event, it looks like there were about 30,000 to 40,000 people at the protest.  I also noticed very few pro-Bush supporters.  We're a fairly liberal town.</p>

<p>What is really sickening to me is that Bush and friends don't seem to care.  Fears of war are dividing our nation, turning the world against us and according to the Federal Reserve, further depressing the US economy.  How can we possibly benefit from a pre-emptive strike against an impoverished regime when the much of the "threat" seems to be detailed in forged and plagiarized papers?  We're making fools of ourselves.</p>

<p>And for me, it just got personal.  Today, my father is landing in Dubai (a city in the United Arab Emirates).  He should be there for a week, but even in a "pro US" Arab country, the danger to US citizens can be enormous.  I know it's his job, but I don't want him there.</p>

<p>The Bush administration is busy destroying our civil liberties, selling us out to the Christian right, destroying any goodwill we have with the rest of the world, has no economic policy to speak of and is pretending that environmental policy is best dictated by business considerations.  Now many innocent (and some not-so-innocent) people are going to die and much of the world has no idea why.  Is there <em>any</em> good associated with this White House?  If there is, I can't see it.  This is a very dark time for our country.</p></p>

<h2>Rhetoric</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2003-03-16T20:20:09</h3>
<p>
"Depression" means something very specific in economic terms.  Looking at the latest <a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/" title="doc.gov">BEA</a doc.gov> data for GDP (not GNP; that's a little harder to find in Google) shows <em>increases</em> in 3Q and 4Q 2002.  That's not even a recession.
</p>
<p>
I agree that war is an ugly thing, that unemployment is terrible, and that things like Total Information Awareness are nasty, horrible things.
</p>
<p>
There's really no excuse for an intelligent, reasonable person to make things up to support an argument.  "The White House wants to kill orphans for oil" is one of those unsupportable claims.
</p>
<p>
My problem with the anti-war movement is twofold.  First, I think a great deal of its arguments are simplistic and completely at odds with history.  (Why is there no longer a League of Nations?)  Second, I find its rhetorical tactics deplorable.  "Bush is scarier than Hussein"?  Please.
</p>
<p>
I don't mean this as a personal assault on you, Ovid.  You're about as reasonable person as I am.  (Sorry<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p>
<p>
It's really tiring to be considered a baby-killing, warmongering, hateful fool when all I really think is that some people will never budge without a show of force.

<h2>Re:Rhetoric</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2003-03-16T22:12:34</h3>
<p>chromatic, I consider you a friend, so I trust you won't take this
personally!</p>

<p>When I used the phrase "further depressing the US economy", I did not mean
that we were experiencing a depression.  I meant, very explicitly, to "Lessen
the activity or force of; weaken".  In fact, for this definition, <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=depress" title="reference.com">dictionary.reference.com</a reference.com>
specifically uses the example <em>feared that rising inflation would further
depress the economy</em>.  I was not implying that we were experiencing a
depression.  As <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46070-2003Mar5.html" title="washingtonpost.com">
reported in the Washington Post</a washingtonpost.com> and many other news sources:</p>

<blockquote><div>The Federal Reserve said Wednesday economic activity around the
country remained subdued in January and February as concerns about a possible
war in Iraq slowed spending by consumers and businesses.</div></blockquote>

<p>I must confess that I do not understand your comment that "<em>There's
really no excuse for an intelligent, reasonable person to make things up to
support an argument</em>."  If you're referring to my comments (I assume you
are), then I can assure you that I am not making any of this up.  I
wholeheartedly agree with you that much of the anti-war movement is a joke.
When a congressman from Georgia, John Lewis, spoke at the peace rally, I
thought that he spoke well, but still provided a completely content-free
speech.  Yeah, I <em>know</em> war is a bad thing.  I didn't need to hear it
again.  I wanted the speakers to lay out their case.  The anti-war movement, in
this regard, has done as pitiful a job as the Bush adminstration has.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are suggesting that the British did not plagiarize any
intelligence reports?  This has been widely covered in the news and since Colin
Powell cited this paper further evidence that we should go to war, it's
important to acknowledge that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/2735031.stm" title="bbc.co.uk">plagiarism</a bbc.co.uk>
gussied up as an "intelligence report" does not lend credibility to the
"pro-war" cause.  If the British government is copying a post-grad student's
papers from the early 90s, I think it's only fair that this be admitted up
front.</p>

<p>It's also fair to ask why we claimed that Iraq was trying to covertly buy
uranium and Powell cited documents that our intelligence agencies uncovered as
further proof of the need to go to war.  When it turned out that these
documents were <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;q=uranium+forgery&amp;btnG=Search+News" title="google.com">crude
forgeries</a google.com>, we again have to be honest and ask ourselves, why is the US
government so intent on rushing into a war when we don't know what we're facing
in Iraq but we do know what we're facing from the rest of the world?</p>

<p>I do have to say that the League of Nations analogy is not totally wrong.
The League of Nations was crippled, in part, because the US refused to support
it.  If we were to be honest and eliminate the veto power held by the five
permanent security council members, the UN would be more likely to act.  Of
course, the US would have pulled out a long time ago, too.  Some, though, feel
that ignoring Hussein is similar to the appeasement of Hitler in the 30s that
led to World War II.  This is ridiculous.  Iraq was pushed out of Kuwait in the
early 90s and we've not had any indication that their impoverished country is
in a position to launch a war.  As soon as Italy invaded Ethiopia or Germany reoccupied the Rhineland, action should have been taken.  If Iraq decided to reclaim anything outside of it's territory, action would be taking -- again.  (Though this begs the question of why we focus on Iraq and ignore so much of this behavior in the rest of the world.)</p>

<p>If, however, we use the "Hussein is a really,
really bad man" argument (which I concede that he is), then why do we remain
silent about many other nations headed by brutal dictators?  Pakistan, our
newfound friend, is hardly headed by a benevolent man and why don't we try to
suppress their Weapons of Mass Destruction -- or ours, for that matter?</p>

<p>I have to ask, is this what Bush meant by "kinder and gentler"?  Of course,
it's hardly out of character given <a href="http://www.bowlingforcolumbine.com/library/wonderful/index.php" title="bowlingforcolumbine.com">past US
behavior</a bowlingforcolumbine.com>.</p>

<p>
I misunderstood your intent with "depressing".  It's a word with connotations in this context.
</p>
<p>
Most of my rant is against the simplistic logic found on protest signs and in the editorial pages of the Oregonian.  Too few people seem to understand either economics (your focus) or history (mine).  Whether that's due to institutional bias, concidental accidents, or the simple realities of publishing, it's not a place to find well-supported arguments.
</p>
<p>
Like you, I'm uncomfortable with the idea of going to war.  In this case, I think the threat of force may indeed help inspections achieve their goal -- a goal that inspections without looming enforcement were unable to achieve.

The sanctions against Iraq which are "murdering" Iraqi children, and the stationing of troops on Saudi soil, only there for containment, are some of the main reasons Bin Laden <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/worldview/story/0,11581,845725,00.html" title="observer.co.uk">gives</a observer.co.uk> for fighting the west:<br> </p><blockquote><div>e) Your forces occupy our countries; you spread your military bases throughout them; you corrupt our lands, and you besiege our sanctities, to protect the security of the Jews and to ensure the continuity of your pillage of our treasures.<br> <p> <br>(f) You have starved the Muslims of Iraq, where children die every day.

Please don't confuse Bush's actions for Christian ones.  He is making decisions based on the oath he took for office, though he often infuses the Bible and God into his rhetoric.<br> <br>JFK (a Catholic) said during his campaign that he would not base his decisions on any decrees from the Pope, putting the interests of his country first.<br> <br>IMO, the only Christian response is peace (the whole "just war" doctrine is a cop-out {again, IMO}, but that's a whole other discussion) - but if the U.S. were a Christian country, we probably wouldn't survive very long among the rest of the world.<br> <br>Peace,<br> <br>Jason
