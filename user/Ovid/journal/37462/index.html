<h1>How Test::Aggregate does 'skip_all'</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2008-09-16T08:03:16</h2>

<div class="span8">
<p><P><em>Before I start, I just want to say how incredibly thankful I am that I did not take that job at Lehman Brothers.  It was <em>soooo</em> tempting.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Aggregate/">Test::Aggregate</a> used to not allow 'skip_all' in plans.  This was because you would "skip_all" 12,000 tests instead of just the 20 or so in the test program.  Very disappointing.  It even warned you if it thought you might be using skip_all.  I mentioned I might fix it one day, but now I <em>had</em> to fix it (0.34_03 and above), but it turned out to not be easy.</p>

<p><tt>Test::Aggregate</tt> uses an <tt>Apache::Registry</tt> trick to make defer loading some code.  We take a small test program like this:</p>

<pre>use strict;
use warnings;

use Test::More 'no_plan';

is 2+2, 4, 'We can add!';</pre>

<p>And turn it into something similar to this (trimming some bits):</p>

<pre>  1 {
  2 #################### beginning of aggtests/test.t ####################
  3     package aggteststestt;
  4
  5     sub run_the_tests {
  6         local $0 = 'aggtests/test.t';
  7
  8 # line 1 "aggtests/test.t"
  9
 10         use strict;
 11         use warnings;
 12
 13         use Test::More 'no_plan';
 14
 15         is 2 + 2, 4, 'We can add!';
 16     }
 17 #################### end of aggtests/test.t ####################
 18 }</pre>

<p>Line 3 guarantees that we're in an encapsulated namespace.  Line 6 solves a problem where many tests make assumptions about the contents of <tt>$0</tt> and line 8 is a line directive which ensures that errors are reported with the original line number and filename.  There's actually a lot more, but this is the core of what we're doing.</p>

<p>The problem was that a "skip_all" in <tt>Test::Builder</tt> figured out an easy way to halt the tests.  It just calls exit and that doesn't work for me.  Since these tests are now wrapped in subs, if I wanted to simulate "skip_all" I had to call "return", but as a stand-alone test program, that looks very strange.  Nonetheless, I had this at the top of a number of test programs:</P>

<pre>if ( $ENV{FAST_TESTS} ) {
    if ( $ENV{TEST_AGGREGATE} ) {
        Test::Builder->new->skip("Skipping $0 under aggregated fast tests");
        return;
    }
    else {
        plan skip_all => 'FAST_TESTS environment variable set';
    }
}
else {
    plan tests => $num_tests;
}</pre>

<p>I couldn't factor that out into a subroutine as that "return" would have to return from an extra stack level.  Ugh!  (more than once I have failed to refactor code because I need to return or eval code at a different stack level from the current one).  However, even using this would throw my "skip_all" warnings in <tt>Test::Aggregate</tt>.</p>

<p>I was washing dishes on Sunday and thinking "damn it.  I wish I had a reliable source filter or Perl 6 grammars.  That would make this problem trivial because I ... I ... I..."</p>

<P>Oh.  I'm a dumbass.</p>

<p>I'm not using source filters, but I'm <em>already rewriting the damned code</em>!  Now the above test script looks a bit like this when rewritten:</p>

<pre>  1 {
  2 #################### beginning of aggtests/test.t ####################
  3     package aggteststestt;
  4
  5     sub run_the_tests {
  6         local $0 = 'aggtests/test.t';
  7
  8         AGGTESTBLOCK: {
  9             if ( my $reason
 10                 = $Test::Aggregate::Builder::SKIP_REASON_FOR{aggteststestt} )
 11             {
 12                 Test::Builder->new->skip($reason);
 13                 last AGGTESTBLOCK;
 14             }
 15 # line 1 "aggtests/test.t"
 16
 17             use strict;
 18             use warnings;
 19
 20             use Test::More 'no_plan';
 21
 22             is 2 + 2, 4, 'We can add!';
 23         }
 24     }
 25 #################### end of aggtests/test.t ####################
 26 }</pre>

<p>Ugly, but you should never see this code anyway.  Problem solved.  (I wanted to put the "last AGGTESTBLOCK" in the <tt>Test::Builder::plan</tt> subroutine, but because it's called at compile-time, the AGGTESTBLOCK hasn't finished parsing, so <tt>&plan</tt> cannot "last" out of a block it can't see).</p>

<P>And that ugly if/else "FAST_TESTS" block above?  Now it looks like this:</p>

<pre># If it's not in a BEGIN block, it will run too late for
# the &run_the_tests call to see it.
BEGIN {
    plan $ENV{FAST_TESTS}
        ? (skip_all => 'FAST_TESTS environment variable set')
        : (tests => $num_tests);
}</pre>

<p>All things considered, I think this has been a good day's work.</p>
