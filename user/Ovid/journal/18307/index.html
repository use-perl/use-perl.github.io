<p><p>First note to self:  <tt>use Clone qw(clone);</tt> is very handy when you need to make a deep copy.</p>

<p>Second note to self:  A singleton object is very handy when you need to guarantee distribution of only one copy of an object.</p>

<p>Third note to self:  <tt>my $child = clone($agent);</tt> is very unhandy when an agent slot contains the aforementioned singleton object.</p>

<p>A friend of mine used to work in Oracle's support department.  A DBA called her to complain that Oracle was throwing a strange error when he was trying to select some records.  She asked what the output was when he typed in <tt>SELECT * FROM foo</tt>.  After much frustration, she had the DBA email her the exact text of the SQL statement she was having him type in.  The "DBA" responded with:</p>

<p><tt>SELECT STAR FROM foo</tt></p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Fourth note to self:  when working with plants, herbivores, and carnivore simulated agents, do not get lazy and refer to herbivores as <tt>$herbs</tt>.  I had cattle trying to eat other cattle (<tt>$herbs</tt>) and couldn't figure out why they weren't.</p></p>
