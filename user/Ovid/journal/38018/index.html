<h1>Perl 5 Programmers Are Dying</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2008-12-04T10:54:38</h2>
</div> <!-- /span4 -->


<div class="span8">
<p><p>If I didn't grab your attention with my <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Ovid/journal/38010">Perl 5 Is Dying</a> post, allow me to follow up.</p>

<p>First, to reiterate my main point:  if only Perl programmers know that Perl isn't dead, it's dead.</p>

<p>Or maybe those of a political bent might appreciate the observation that for many people, perception trumps reality.  Seriously, perception trumps reality.  If decision makes <em>perceive</em> that Perl is dead, we can all laugh quietly at their idiocy.  After all, some COBOL programmers are still laughing.</p>

<p>Got that?  Really?  Seems to me a few people either missed that point or dispute it.  Fair enough.  Now sit back and relax.</p>

<p>When I was living in Portland working for a company called 'OnSite Technology', we had trouble hiring Perl programmers.  We had no trouble <em>finding</em> Perl programmers.  They were a dime a dozen.  People write a couple of admin scripts in Perl and they put Perl on their CV.  Now don't get me wrong, I have Java on my CV, but I would never <em>dream</em> of sitting down for a Java interview without their knowing up front that my knowledge is pre 1.5 and I don't know any of the modern tools.  It's only there because I want employers to know that I have some exposure to it, not that I think I know it.</p>

<p>Now, maybe I'm just being naive, but somehow people with Perl on their CV think they can do this job, but they can't.  Not even close.  At OnSite we struggled so hard to find programmers that we hired one of our programmers from California and another one from Idaho (or was that Iowa?  I forget).  Two-thirds of our Perl programmers were from out of state because that's what we had to do to keep our company going.</p>

<p>It's not just Portland.  In the "dying" thread, <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=41735&cid=66169">mock complained about companies in Victoria and Vancouver having trouble hiring Perl programmers</a>.  We're having the same problem here in London.  My brother (the Java programmer, not <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/1424008">the one banned from Portugal</a>) tells me that he can't find Perl programmers but Java guys are a dime a dozen.  Here at the BBC, I've been told that lack of <em>competent</em> Perl programmers has been one of the reasons we've considered moving away from Perl.  Many employers I've spoken with in London tell me the same sad story.  In fact, it's bad enough that Dave Cross picked up a Simon Cozens' project and offered a free Perl class at the BBC.  We might even do this again.</p>

<p>Oddly, I hear that Python has a similar problem (I wouldn't know), but that Ruby and PHP don't.  While this is still all anecdotal evidence, when employers tell me that they can find developers for languages which are not Perl, I find that interesting.  And maybe they're wrong, but like the whole "Perl 5 Is Dying" meme, it's still a problem.</p>

<p>So, you've got a great product idea and need to start a new team.  You've heard that Perl is really quick to develop in, but you hear that Perl is dead and you can't find any Perl programmers.  Hmm ...</p>

<p>We can point to <a href="http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=c%2C+java%2C+python%2C+perl%2C+ruby%2C+c%2B%2B%2C+c%23%2C+.net&l=">Perl's rather flat job trends</a> and claim we're not dying, but others can point out that we're not growing.  Of course, other languages have flat job trends, but they're also not fighting the bad PR we are.  We can <a href="http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=python%2C+perl%2C+ruby%2C+php&l=&relative=1">compare relative job growth in our direct competitors</a> and see that we're dead last.  I suppose we can wait until the pain really sets in (and I know that some will), but then it will be too late.</p>

<p>Publish articles.  Publish articles in places which aren't typically Perl-centric.  Blog about Perl.  If you have a Perl-related site, try and make it look modern, not like some throwback to the 90s.  If you don't have the skill for that (I certainly don't), ask for help.  If your bosses say "Perl is dying", politely correct them with information, not faith.</p>

<p>And if your bosses counter with "we can't find good Perl programmers", well, I ain't got no advice for you there.  If the decision makers <em>and</em> new programmers decide that Perl is dead, then we know where we're going.  It's a vicious cycle we have to break.  In the past few years, dynamic languages have been carving their own niche, but Perl's not well-represented there even though many of them learned their hard won lessons from us.</p>

<p>There is simply no way you can compare recruiting Java skilled programmers to recruiting Perl skilled programmers.</p><p>Java is hugely mainstream with large numbers of graduates churned out who don't even know how to set classpaths or sort lists.</p><p>Perl is not mainstream and has graduates who trained in it at work or at home, it's rarely a first language or formally taught.</p><p>Recruiting good staff is hard, the size of the pool doesn't make it any easier.</p><p>Recruiting good staff who have specialised a bit (i.e. become good at perl) is a bit harder.</p><p>Otherwise you're doing it wrong.</p><p>The BBC are struggling to get staff because they are paying well below market rates, they always have, and likely always will - look at the contract rates for the BBC, the only time people start to really look at the beeb is during a recession when the better paid jobs aren't as available.</p><p>The fact that a couple of people in north america find it easier to find Java people doesn't reflect on Perl much, it's always been easier to find Java people, it always will - Perl's pool of skilled coders could increase by 500% and still not come close.</p><p>When you compare to Python and Ruby, you see that they are only growing fast relative to their very small starting size, the actual numbers don't add up to much, and have already peaked, the growth of  less mainstream languages than Perl is now static or seasonal.</p>

<p>You've totally missed the point. It isn't that it is easier to find Java programmers than Perl programmers, it's that it is *hard* to find *competent* Perl programmers for a wage that the employer can afford. While it is true that Java programmers are churned out of University at a dime a dozen, they remain in the language and fill out a continuum of competency. Your response is "Pay More", but that again ignores the underlying problem (and the realities of the real world).

</p><p>In a healthy community there would be lots of people across the continuum of competency, and many would fit within the price to competency ratio that the BBC is trying to hire. In an unhealthy community (one that isn't dead, but say has some kind of systematic problem) you find pockets of competency you simply can't fill. Either people will be too experienced and have  salary requirements that are way beyond your budget, or you churn through dozens of incompetent programmers.

</p><p>The fact that there are (several cause I've heard it too) stories out there about how hard it is to find competent programmers means that we have these holes in our community, and that the Perl community is sick.</p>

<p>At my previous, and current company they've run into the same problem, as well at as another largish dev house in toronto.  Salaries are getting large, because finding people that already have the skills is getting challenging to impossible.</p><p>The last two hires at my previous employer had little to no perl experience, but were already programmers (ie: had CS degrees of some sort).  We then took it upon ourselves to bring them up to speed in perl.</p><p>Obviously that won't work for everyone, but if you hire smart people that don't know perl, they can be turned into excellent perl programmers.

As an added bonus you don't have to untrain bad perl habits out of them, and if you're working on 'new' platforms (catalyst, moose, badger, whatever), they aren't as likely to want to go back to what they know.</p>

This is really the key point. A good programmer who knows a couple programming languages already should be able to train into a new one in about the same amount of time it's going to take them to get used to your code base anyway.<br/><br/>For Perl, if you can find someone with both PHP and Java experience or experience in Ruby or Python, you've basically won.

I run a very small consulting company and that's what I did too.  I hired a Python programmer and had him learn Perl.  He's very smart and picked it up in no time.  Soon after he was hired, I sent him a copy of Perl Best Practices and he learned many good habits from the start.

(Disclaimer: I'm a Perl apostate.)<br/><br/>You seem to be saying that competent Perl programmers are scarce and growing scarcer.  It's also non-disputable that huge amounts of Perl code are being written every year.  It would seem to follow that the average quality of Perl written over time has been falling, and anecdotally that's exactly what I'm seeing.  For at least the last five years, the Perl that crosses my desk has been uniformly godawful--much poorer in quality than the first program I wrote as a kid.  Ray Kroc may have been an excellent chef, but since all I've been seeing out of McDonalds in recent years is utter crap, I'd have a strong bias against him.  I think this works against Perl as well.  Although I think Perl has serious problems in itself (as compared to the alternatives), it may also just be suffering from Gresham's Law (bad money pushes out good).  That is, as the language has been flooded by newbies, pretenders, and those who don't care about quality, those who *do* care about quality have tended to look for greener pastures.

Re confirmation bias: No, what I see is clear cut.  Better to argue instead that my case is not representative.  I work in bioinformatics, and the Perl is pretty uniformly awful--mostly written by biologists I suppose.  (When I say "awful", I don't mean "unimaginative" or "not what I would have done", I mean "poke your eyes out and run screaming".)  Now, it may not be Perl's fault that a large number of people writing it are not competent, but that doesn't change the fact that randomly sampling Perl code, particularly in some application domains, draws very poor code on average.  If I loved Perl, I'd be trying to figure out some way to change that situation, because it seems to be something that would repel people from the language.

<p>To a degree, perhaps.

<p>As has been noted, bioinformatics has a lot of non-programmers programming in Perl.  IIRC, average salaries in bioinformatics is less than what you see in other areas of Perl.  The two phenomena are likely related, and both will lead to lower average code quality.</p><p>Incidentally the quality of the Perl code that I've personally been seeing over the years has been going up, not down.  That's because as my career has advanced I've been working with more experienced groups of competent people.  While this is a good thing for me, I'm not sure that it is good in general.  Because I also see that the kinds of people who used to write crap Perl CGI programs are now writing crap PHP systems.  And sure, most of the PHP being written is bad, but if you get enough people using it widely enough, PHP is eventually going to grow its own circle of competent people.</p>

<p>I don't understand what people keep complaining about. Perl 5 has some legacy, but it is not broken. You don't have to have a major new release of the language every year to keep it current. Perl is mature, and that's a good thing. It has all you need. It's even fun and exciting; you know it. (At the same time there is the next wave of development happening all time.)</p><p>(IMO, saying that Perl is too nice (too easy, too liberal, too flexible or what ever I keep hearing about) is just an absurd subject for criticism!)</p><p>So it's all about the applications, the community and marketing. You don't have to have the finest, latest, best and scientifically most interesting language and compilers to make is succeed. Take PHP for an example.</p><p>Perl has CPAN and still a lot of very experienced and talented developers - that's an huge asset. The problem is that average evaluator (your boss, your client, new developers you'd like to hire, bloggers and other influencers) do not see/find things happening in CPAN, they do not see the discussions here, they do not find the piles of documentation online and so on. They just google for perl and will be immediately disappointed.</p><p>For these people all perl sites <strong>look</strong> like the development and life on those sites has ended in the 20th century. What would be your executive decision based on that first impression? Just compare ruby-lang.org and perl.org.</p>

Yes, and Perl 6 will be a major milestone in the history of interpreted languages.
</p><p>
However, my feeling is that the Perl community is now lacking entry- and mid-level users in "new" application areas like Web development. I don't see the language details as the problem here.
</p><p>People are looking for CMS:s, modern MVC frameworks, good looking friendly sites, easy to find documentation, exciting examples and a consistent presence in the web. All can be done with Perl, all <em>has</em> been done with Perl, but people just can't see it. I think www.perl.org is a key issue here. That's a bare minimum!</p><p>
Every Linux distribution has Perl installed by default, all Apache stuff is there, CPAN is full of recently updated modules. Everything is there, ready to rock! We just have a bad image, crappy web sites and maybe concentrate too much into academic discussion about language features. That discussion and development is important and I see you guys doing wonderful work there, but as a whole, this is not serving the potential new users as much as we should be.
It's not your fault, I'm just inviting new and old people to participate into this effort.

<p>Exactly, I think of it like Linux Dists. There are different dists for different markets, tuners, stability hounds, FOSS nazis, Usablilty wonks<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... there should be Perl dists tuned to different goals similarly.</p>

<tt>Something like this would be very nice....<br><br>use dist 'perl5++';&nbsp; &nbsp;# switches on strict, warnings &amp; mooseX::Declare!<br>#use autobox;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;# its there but don't need it right now<br><br>class Sum {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; has 'x' =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Num', is =&gt; 'rw', default =&gt; 0 );<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; method add (Num $y) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $self-&gt;x + $y;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>}<br><br>my $maths= Sum-&gt;new( x =&gt; 10 );<br>say $maths-&gt;add( 2 );<br></tt>

Yeah, that's when you know things are getting bad.

<h2>My experience</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alan/">Alan</a> on 2008-12-06T04:44:08</h3>
I started in Perl 2 and spent many years coding perl, contributing to CPAN, etc. Then about 3 years ago, at work, python was chosen to be our scripting language. I resisted at first, then gave in and learned it. For what I do, it is much better - I do scientific programming and numerical analysis. With the extensions available (numpy and scipy), it is much easier than perl to do that sort of stuff, so I am a convert. I'd still use perl for stuff primarily around regex and string manipulation, though.
