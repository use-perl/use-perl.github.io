<p><p>Kind of weird, but I now have an agent for a tentative book deal.  There is no book contract yet and certainly no guarantees.  In fact, I have nothing but a possible schedule that requires me and a co-author to each churn out over four and a half pages a day for three months.  Is this doable?  Given my writing experience, this seems like something that can be done, but not easily.  I would hate to sacrifice quality for quantity.  There would be no point in writing.</p>

<p>All in all, I think I can sum this up as a definite possibility of a firm maybe of three months of agony.  Clearly, I'm not as bright as I thought.</p></p>

I'm curious, why did you get an agent?  Is there an upside that I missed out on?
<p>
As far as whether 4 pages per day is doable...  Well, I definitely couldn't do it but writing speed is a personal attribute.  Have you ever written a chapter-length article?  Figuring out how long it took you might give you a good estimate for how long it will take you to write a chapter in your book.
</p><p>
Also, does that time estimate include editing time?  I found that I spent almost as much time editing my work as I did writing new material.

<p>Of course there's an upside to getting an agent.  There's a percentage of money that I no longer have to worry about spending<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Seriously though, I was contacted by another individual and the agent/author relationship was already set up and I was merely being contacted by a potential coauthor.  Personally, I'm fine with that.  I used to sell cars (don't hate me for it!) and while I'm good at negotiations and paperwork, I prefer to minimize that.  If someone else wants a percentage to handle those details, I can live with that.  As I have no expectations of getting rich off of this, I suspect that increased earnings due to a new item on my resume will offset any potential losses to an agent.</p>

<p>My coauthor is writing a sample chapter to estimate his writing speed and I'm waiting for some additional material before I can start the same exercise.  I can't see myself cranking out four quality, well-researched pages a day for three months.  And as far as I am aware -- still waiting for some details -- the estimate is for the first draft.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I'm single (again) and have no children, so if I'm willing to ditch all of my social obligations, I have <em>plenty</em> of spare time -- assuming I don't keep working weekends.</p>

Well, you didn't say if you otherwise have a job, and how many hours per week you work.  If you have a 40 hour per week job, I consider highly unlikely that you'll do 4 pages per day (which means 28 per week).  That comes out to a chapter per week _non-stop_ for 3 months.<br> <br>When writing the Mason book, I was working about 30 hours per week and I did not write nearly that fast.  Maybe I wasn't pushing myself very hard but I found that I had to be in a certain frame of mind to produce anything decent.  It wasn't entirely hard to get into that frame of mind, but I couldn't do it if I was really tired or whatnot.<br> <br>Now, once I got into writing mode, I could easily crank out more than 4 pages at once, but there's no way I could have done that every day.<br> <br>It's hard to estimate how long the writing took, since about 2/3 of the way through both I and my co-author (Ken Williams) took some time off to beat the at-that-point unreleased Mason 1.10 into shape, because that's what we were documenting.<br> <br>Doing that coding in turn required us to go back and revise chunks of the book.<br> <br>But if I had to take a guess, I'd say I wrote about 150 pages (in O'Reilly page sizes) over the course of six months, which is nowhere near what you're aiming for.<br> <br>I'm married, though I have no kids, and I do have other volunteers things I work on besides my paying jobs, but nonetheless, I think you are grossly overestimating your speed, unless you have literally no other work to distract you.

<p>I do have a full-time job, but I am single, so that helps.  I do have a fairly active social life, though, so that's something which needs to get tossed by the wayside for a while.</p>

<p> <tt>do {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;unless ( $working ) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;write( $stuph ) &amp;&amp; undef $social_life;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
} while ( ! $dead );
</tt> </p>

<p>My coauthor and I are still working out deadline details, but I have no idea how this is going to turn out.  There are a few other ingredients which have been tossed into the mix, so time will tell.</p>

<p>I still have a heck of a lot of writing to do, though, no matter how you look at the situation.  This is going to be tough.  On the other hand, who <em>doesn't</em> want to be underpaid for the privilege of throwing away their social life?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
