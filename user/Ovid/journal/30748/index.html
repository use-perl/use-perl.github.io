<p><p>Have you played with <a href="http://www.linuxedge.org/?q=node/58">Compiz</a> yet?  If you haven't see it, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lawkc3jH3ws&eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elifehacker%2Ecom%2Fsoftware%2Ftop%2Fhack%2Dattack%2Dtop%2D10%2Dubuntu%2Dapps%2Dand%2Dtweaks%2D195437%2Ephp">YouTube has a nice video of it</a>.  All you Windows users can just drool now.  You can't have it.</p>

<p>So it's all cool and stuff, but I thought about disabling it because my X session would periodically restart.  After enough playing around, I noticed that it always happened in vim.  It always happened in vim when I made a mistake.  It always happened in vim when I was still holding down 'shift' and hitting the backspace key.  What?  You use Perl?  You probably have one finger practically glued to your shift key.  I figured that it was some strange bug.  Nope.  Turns out it's deliberate.  Compiz is built on <a href="http://www.novell.com/linux/xglrelease/">Xgl</a>.  By <em>default</em>, you restart Xgl by hitting shift-backspace.  The people at Novell thought this was a good idea.  I'll pause now so you can stop laughing.</p>

<p>I think they came up with this shortly after they introduced their "free crack in the break room" employee incentive program.</p>

<p>The workarounds at <a href="http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_XGL/Troubleshooting#Shift_backspace">this Gentoo wiki</a> fixed the problem, but had nasty side effects of strange things such as, say, disabling some keys, swapping my 'z' and 'y' keys, and various things like that.  However, the <tt>~/.Xmodmap</tt> solution worked, but I did have to edit their wiki to fix their broken syntax.</p></p>
