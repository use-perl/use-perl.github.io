<p><p>Another SOC "stream of consciousness" journal entry.</p>

<p>Sometimes I like spam.  I once received some foreign spam that I couldn't read, but the image with the email showed bloody, bandaged feet.  Somehow, I prefer to just sit back and speculate as to what it was about.</p>

<p>Most annoying spam comment of the week comes from a spam that has the usual "you have given permission" bullshit.  But at least they let me unsubscribe:  <strong>To be removed from that list, please contact the company you have given permission.</strong></p>

<p>My favorite spam of all time has to be the guy who thought that using multi-level spam marketing to sell cheap Chinese toothbrushes was going to work.  Yeah, I'm going to buy toothbrushes through the mail ...</p>

<p>Lately, I've been getting a rash of "panic spam".  They have subject lines like "My car broke down and I need a ride to work, poec!" or "Can I borrow you car?".  Does this stuff even work?  I just delete them without reading them and I can't even begin to imagine who might be suckered in to opening one of those.  Somehow, I don't think the spammers expect anyone to be taken in.  I think they're hoping that people will experience such a "what the f*ck?" factor from the spam subject that they'll open them out of curiosity.  If that's the case, they can at least come up with better material.  "Cheap nuclear weapons!", "Fresh puppy meat!" and "Real moon cheese samples!" are sure to be crowd-pleasers.  Note the mandatory exclamation points!</p>
