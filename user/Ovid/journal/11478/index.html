<p><p>I'm working like mad to finish my <tt>use strict 'sql';</tt> presentation for next Wednesday's <a href="http://portland.pm.org/">Portland Perl Mongers</a> presentation.  For the most part, the text is finished and a straight run through lasts about half an hour.  Assuming that I get some questions, that should fill my 45 minute timeslot just nicely.</p>

<p>I'm using KPresenter for the presentation software and am creating an HTML version, just in case.  Unfortunately, KPresenter is saving each slide slide as an image rather than using <tt>img</tt> tags for just the image.  As a result, the presentation is much larger than it should be (darn it!).  Still, KPresenter is very easy to use and I can't complain too much.  It's free after all.</p>

<p>Speaking of free tools, I'm teaching myself GIMP at the same time.  Many of the images are close to what I need, but not quite.  In my discussion of embedded SQL, I use an image of a bike embedded in a tree.  The bike is impossible to see in the original picture, so I lightened the entire image and then hand-selected the bike and brought that out.  I also tried to take an image of a monkey looking into a mirror and put my picture in the mirror, but I couldn't figure out how to get the layers working.  Unfortunately, the reflection of the monkey in the mirror is so poor that I couldn't get it very clear, despite a fair amount of effort.</p>

<p>Regardless of my poor skill wit da GIMP, it's been ridiculously helpful in putting everything together and it's surprisingly easy to use.  And it only crashed once!</p>

<p>And as for "patches" (referenced in the title), I'm wearing one right now.  Day two of no cigarettes.  Maybe it's a bad time to quit, but I always have an excuse not to quit, so I figured I would quit the excuses, first.</p>

<p>As a side note, relatively innocuous search terms take on disturbing new twists when Safe Search is off on Google Images.</p></p>
