<p><p>I'll be heading down to the beach today for a "goth" beach party.  Not sure what that's all about, but I've been informed that I must wear black (Johnny Cash would have fit right in).  I figured I'll grab some picnic type food and a game of Twister and we'll see what happens.  Of course, it's kind of sick and wrong when I look forward to ending the weekend, getting back to work and continuing my latest project.</p>

<p>My latest project is a custom Web content management system.  For the most part, I have a three line Perl script that drives everything.  All is done behind the scenes with Template Toolkit, a database,. and a few modules.  To have it actually do stuff just involves writing plugins, but they can handle just about anything that you'd want a large, robust Web content management system to handle.  I'm surprised at how small my codebase is so I assume that I must have done something wrong :)  Regrettably, this is proprietary work for my company, so I can't release it.</p>

<p>The <tt>AI::Perlog</tt> module is kind of in limbo right now.  I took about a week or so off from that project and now I can't quite seem to wrap my head around the code that I wrote.  In fact, I even becamse convinced that the code that I wrote could not work, so I wrote tests to prove this.  My tests passed, though, so I guess what I wrote is more robust than I thought.</p>

<p>Next, I'll be working on the unification problem.  My first stab at it had mixed results, but it still appeared to work.  Unfortunately, I don't see anyway I can get even the basics of this done without the potential for nested maps and for loops.  I won't worry about performance until such time that I can probe it's an issue, but it's dissappointing.</p></p>

<p>
Hmm, that's mostly a solved problem -- no wonder your codebase is small.  You need data modelling, templating, some form of dispatch, and an extension mechanism.  The only real problem is getting plugins to play nicely together.  Since lots of other people are interested in the same thing, it's not difficult to find an existing project that lets you build a handful of components with relative ease.  (I could put together an interesting Slash or Everything plugin in a couple of days.)
</p>
<p>
Workflow's a more interesting question at this point.  How do you put the pieces together in a way that makes sense?  How do you model the business rules that govern the content?
