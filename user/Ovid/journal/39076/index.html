<div class="span8">
<p><p>Because I've moved, I don't yet have 'net access at home and it appears that, for varying reasons, getting it is particularly annoying.  As a result, I've been doing some work at home, but not uploading it to the CPAN or github.  Basically:</p>

<pre>package My::Database;
use AI::Logic::Database 
  variables  => [qw{Person}],
  predicates => [qw{male/1 female/1 married/2 husband/1}];

male { 'frank' };
male { 'tony' };
male { 'bill' };
male { 'tom' };
male { 'alvin' };
female { 'sally' };
female { 'sarah' }:

married { 'frank', 'sarah' };
married { 'tom', 'alvin' };

Rule {
  husband { Person } =>
    male    { Person },
    married { Person, Any };
}</pre>

<p>The syntax looks strange, but if you know Prolog, the above should look strange, but be familiar.  To query it, issue queries with callbacks to handle successful queries:</p>

<pre>use AI::Logic 'My::Database';

my $frank = Var 'frank';
male($frank, sub { print 'frank is male' });

my @males; # get all males
my $male = Var;
male($male, sub { push @males => $male->value });

my $is      = 'is not';
my $name    = get_some_guys_name();
my $husband = Var $name;
husband($husband, sub { $is = 'is' });

print "$name $is_husband a husband\n"'</pre>

<p>Some of you may have noticed that 'alvin' will never be listed as a husband, but that's because I don't have disjunction ('or') figured out.  I know how to do it, but I don't know the right syntax to make it obvious.  For the time being, adding an additional rule solves this case (and is logically equivalent).</p>

<pre> # handle the case of 'alvin'
Rule {
  husband { Person } =>
    male    { Person },
    married { Any, Person };
}</pre>

<p>The cut operator (!) should be trivial to implement, but it will be the <tt>Cut</tt> keyword, and lists will eventually be added, at which point the system might even be vaguely complete.  I doubt it will be fast, but I suspect it will be a heck of a lot faster than <tt>AI::Prolog</tt>.  If I'm really, really lucky, it might even be fast enough for some production work (I've a few optimizations in mind, but I've no intention of implementing any until I have more work done on this).</p>

<p>This is a generalization of Adrian Howard's <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=193649">continuation-based logic solver</a>.</p></p>

<p>I might be able to get it out there this weekend as my girlfriend's flat has internet, but I'll be pretty busy running around London handling errands.</p>
