<div class="span8">
<p><p>Absent of auto-boxing, I find handling many basic things in classes to be very annoying.  Thus, I've toyed with scrapping this sort of ugly code:</p>

<pre>package Stuff;

sub new {
    my ( $class, @args ) = @_;
    bless {
        args => \@args,
    } => $class;
}

sub add_args {
    my $self = shift;
    push @{ $self->{args} } => @_;   # UGLY!!!
}</pre>

<p>Instead (I know it's a lousy name, but it's just an example):</p>

<pre>package Stuff;
use Class::Bits 'aref';

sub new {
    my ( $class, @args ) = @_;
    bless {
        args => aref(@args),
    } => $class;
}

sub add_args {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->{args}->push(@_);   # NOT UGLY!!!
}</pre>

<p>Obviously, support for hashes would need to be in there, too (and all requisite methods, including a decent slice syntax).  We need Perl 6 now! :(</p></p>

<h2>Not to pimp my own module or anything, but...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mauzo/">mauzo</a> on 2008-07-11T01:48:25</h3>
Data::PostfixDeref (also a lame name, but never mind) will allow you to write <p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>sub add_args {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $self = shift;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; push $self-&gt;{args}[], @_;<br>}</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p> instead. It has its limitations: there is no slice syntax, because I haven't decided whether <code>$foo-&gt;{bar}[][1, 2, 3]</code> is too weird or not yet, and because it's somewhat trickier to implement; and it doesn't allow a direct deref <code>$foo-&gt;[]</code> due to the optimizer not getting run on the ops involved.
</p><p>It <b>doesn't</b> use a source filter, instead it hooks into <code>PL_check[]</code>, so it shouldn't suffer from all the 'can't-parse-perl' issues source filters have; nevertheless, I'd still consider it 'alpha'...</p>



<h2>list as object</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Eric Wilhelm/">Eric Wilhelm</a> on 2008-07-11T07:23:01</h3>
<p>That would be List::oo.</p><p>But Class::Accessor::Classy should do what you want without even needing to write the add_args() method.</p>

<p>List::oo does look very similar to what I want, except that I want is simply to have all the the ease of use of objects for arrays and hashes (maybe scalars?) without the messiness.  Also, by using nicely de-coupled functions to build things, I wouldn't have to "buy into" a particular object system.  This would work with Moose as well as with hand-rolled code (which is why Class::Accessor::Classy doesn't seem like the right fit for me).</p>

<p>"All the ease of use of objects without the messiness"?  What's the messy part?  List::oo blesses an arrayref, so you're never far from punching through the abstraction.  If the constructor is the messy part, then you have L().</p><p>Or do you mean cognitive messiness?  Abstraction layers do tend to be abstract, and everything's a waterbed, so...</p><p>As for object systems - C::A::Classy really isn't much of one.  And that is intentional.  I'm not sure what the benefit of de-coupling is supposed to be - you get to write more code?</p><p>It sounds as if you want all of the features of an object system, without having to say that you're using an object system.  Can we just call it a codepole, stick it in the ground, and get on with pitching the real tent?</p>

<h2>You need Perl&amp;#160;6 now?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2008-07-12T04:52:01</h3>
<p>You&#8217;re saying it&#8217;d be easier to port your codebase to Perl&#160;6 than to upgrade your perl to a version that supports <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?autobox" title="cpan.org">autobox</a cpan.org>?<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt> </p>

<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2008-07-12T11:15:39</h3>
<p>Except that if I distribute modules, I want to minimize the dependencies.  How many times have people failed to install a module because they don't like the the number of dependencies, have an aversion to a particular dependency or can't risk upgrading a particular dependency?  The dependency problem is a very real one in Perl 5 and suggesting (admittedly sexy) XS code to solve this problem seems like overkill<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p><p>A very tiny, lightweight embeddable utility would be nice here (yes, there's the risk of duplicate code, but at least I don't screw with other's installations).</p>

<h2>Moose</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jrockway/">jrockway</a> on 2008-07-13T09:40:37</h3>
<p>Ya do know that Moose + MooseX::AttributeHelpers would abstract away all that code you wrote, right?</p><p>Boxing is nice, but not really what you need for your example.</p><p>Anyway, here's the same code with Moose:</p><p><code><br>package Stuff;<br>use Moose;<br>use MooseX::AttributeHelpers;</code></p><p><code>has args =&gt; (<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is         =&gt; 'ro',<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; isa        =&gt; 'ArrayRef',<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; metaclass  =&gt; 'Collection::Array',<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; auto_deref =&gt; 1,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; provides   =&gt; {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; push =&gt; 'add_args',<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; },<br>);</code></p><p><code>sub BUILDARGS {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shift; # shift off the invocant<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return { args =&gt; \@_ };<br>}<br></code></p><p>Then:</p><p><code><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; my $foo = Stuff-&gt;new(qw/foo bar baz/);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; $foo-&gt;add_args(qw/quux gorch/);</code></p><p><code>
&nbsp; &nbsp; my @args = $foo-&gt;args; # foo, bar, baz, quux, gorch<br></code></p>

BTW, normally I align the =&gt; arrows, but use.perl killed the spaces in the &lt;code&gt; block.  Yay.
