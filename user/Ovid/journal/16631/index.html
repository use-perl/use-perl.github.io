<div class="span8">
<p><p>Anyone who follows my use.perl journal and my writing at Perlmonks knows that I write a fair amount.  I enjoy it enough that I've decided to start looking into writing as a sideline.  Due to some of my <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=publius_ovidius">Live Journal writing</a>, the editor of <a href="http://www.apotheon.com/">@political</a> has contacted me about writing articles for his site.  While I wasn't sure at first whether or not I should, I agreed and have turned in my first article "The Market Paradox".  The article has been accepted and hopefully will be on the site soon.</p>

<p>While admittedly it's a Web site and not a magazine (nor does it pay -- yet), I think it will be good practice for me to write to deadline and develop my craft.  Though I seriously doubt I will be earning a living as a full-time writer -- I enjoy programming too much -- I expect to learn quite a bit.  It's time for me to stop being lazy and really focus on writing well.  This journal is a lousy example.</p></p>

<h2>Never a &quot;full time writer&quot;</h2>

I never envisioned being possibly more well known for my writing than for my programming.  However, I found over time that both the art and science of programming and the art and science of writing tickle the same parts of my brain.  So it doesn't matter much to me which one of those I'm doing.
<p>
Also, keep in mind that you're never a "full time writer".  In any writing biz, you're spending 80% of your time preparing to write (just as you do coding) and only 20% of your time writing (like coding).  If you're writing about things that interest you, you're probably doing the research anyway, so you might as well put it on paper for others.</p>

<p>Thanks for the insight.  I appreciate it.</p>
