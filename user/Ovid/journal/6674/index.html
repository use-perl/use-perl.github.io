<p><p>Well, you knew I would have another entry on this.  First Qwest Communications, on behalf of MSN, started <a href="/user/Ovid/journal/5259">billing me for services that I didn't have</a>.  After many phone calls, Qwest agreed that I didn't owe the money and then <a href="/user/Ovid/journal/6137">sent me to collections</a> for it.  After I got fed up and filed a complaint with the Oregon Department of Justice, my account was <a href="/user/Ovid/journal/6237">credited with too much money</a>.  Today, I just received a "Final Account Notice" for these charges.  I must pay now to avoid being sent to collections for this fictitious bill.</p>

<p>After another tiring phone call where they couldn't seem to figure out which department to shuffle me to, I talked to a very pleasant lady who explained that, due to them posting some of the credit to the wrong account, I actually <em>do</em> owe them twenty-three dollars, but not for the MSN charges that they sent me the final notice for.  That, apparently, was a mistake which the lady solemnly assured me would not happen again.</p>

<p>I didn't curse.  I didn't raise my voice.  Nevertheless, she was less than thrilled with my response.</p></p>

I think you need to pay them that $23 in a mix of pennies and nickels.

While this might make you feel better, some poor schlep clerk will just have to roll these up and put them in for deposit.  Heh... If you really want to make it more painful for them, figure out how to make it the most odd lots of change possible.  For example, 45 pennies, 39 nickles (40 nickles to a roll, right?), 49 dimes... whatever you can to make it the most work.<br> <p>If they're a company with good policies about such things, they'll be able to cash it in to an office petty cash account, but they probably can't.<br> </p><p>It really won't do anything to correct the problems or hit the corporation where it hurts.  You may have to show up in person at their office to pay in coins, so it'll be a hassle. <br> </p><p>Involving the Oregon Public Utilities Commission was a good move.</p>

 <p> For those contemplating this, a merchant is not actually required to accept more than (a dollar or 26 cents, I forget which) in change other than quarters.  So if you want to pull this kind of stunt, use quarters. </p>
