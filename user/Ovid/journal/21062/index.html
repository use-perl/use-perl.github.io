<p><p>Gosh, now I feel really stupid.  I couldn't figure out how to save my program in Squeak.  Or is this called 'saving an image'?  I don't know.  Somehow I thought all was good, but the next time I opened Squeak, everything seemed to be gone.  Then I found a save button and was able to save, but it didn't ask for a name.  I can't figure out how to switch images or anything like that.  This is a very strange world.  I can see why some people are intimidated by it.  It seems easy to use but the environment is completely foreign to me.</p></p>

<h2>The traditional smalltalk method</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2004-09-27T00:40:11</h3>
The "Image" is like your desktop.  When you're done for the day, you hit "save", and then you "load" that image tomorrow when you start again.
<p>
Every change you make is being charged against the current "project".  You can manage projects with the desktop menus.  Although all changes are being made to the one image, you traditionally make a project for each realm of interest that you're working on.  (You can manage changes manually to say "no, that was really for project Y, not project X" as well.)
</p><p>
When you're ready to share your work, you "fileout" a "project", and someone else can "filein" that project file to their image.
</p><p>
From time to time, you'll want to "clean your desk".  You fileout all your projects of interest, then start with a fresh image, and then file them all in, and that's your new desk.  You'll also do that to keep your Squeak image in sync with the master images for updates.</p>
