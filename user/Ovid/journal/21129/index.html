<p><p>Tomorrow morning, at 8:00 AM Pacific time, I'll be going under the knife.  The doctor will be inserting one or two prosthetics in my right ear to replace missing bones and adding support to the ear drum.  Currently, I'm almost completely deaf in this ear.  After the surgery, I should have close to normal hearing.  For some reason, I'm quite nervous about the surgery, but I'll be looking forward to hearing again.  Of course, it will take a few weeks.  The hearing improvement should be immediate, but then the doctor will pack my ear with gelatin (presumably blood flavored.)  After a couple of weeks of ear drops to remove the gelatin, I should be fine.</p>

<p>For years, I've had friends learn to walk on my left side or deal with me scurrying like a cockroach to their right side so that we can have conversations without me constantly asking them to repeat themselves.  Hopefully, this will end soon.  But as one girlfriend told me "the thought of walking on your left side is just weird."</p></p>

<h2>Good luck</h2>

I hope the operation works out for you, and that learning to rebalance yourself in the presence of new audio cues won't be too traumatic.

<p>Thank you!  I'm looking forward to hitting the goth/industrial clubs and redestroying my hearing<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Actually, I lost the hearing due to disease.  I've not been doing too much damage to it with music.</p>

Good luck ! Hope it all goes well for you.<p>
It sounds like a very casual surgery, so I'm sure it will all be just fine.</p>

Not to belittle our friend Ovid's plight, but...
</p>

Does "<i>casual surgery</i>" mean the doctors get to wear chinos and loafers? &nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>;^)</tt>

<h2>Good wishes</h2>

<p>It's 8:06 AM Pacific time as I write this, so in principle it's not too late to send good wishes.  You don't mention a hospital stay, so I presume it's outpatient and you'll be back at the keyboard by this evening.</p>
<p>Now about those goth clubs fresh after surgery....</p>



<h2>Enjoy your new ear!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/da/">da</a> on 2004-10-01T19:22:20</h3>
I wonder... if you have ice-cream to soothe your throat after tonsil surgery, should you listen to Mozart, Yanni, and waterfall-white-noise after ear surgery?...<br> <br>Good luck, speedy recovery!
