<h1>Perl 6 Roles Question</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>Imagine a <tt>PracticalJoke</tt> class. It needs a non-lethal <tt>explode()</tt> from a <tt>Spouse</tt> role and a timed <tt>fuse()</tt> from a <tt>Bomb</tt> role.  Unfortunately, each role provides the both methods.  With Moose, this is trivial to resolve:</p>

<pre>package PracticalJoke;
use Moose;
with 'Bomb'  => { excludes => 'explode' };
    'Spouse' => { excludes => 'fuse' };</pre>

<p>How the heck do I do that with Perl 6?  No matter how many times I read <a href="http://perlcabal.org/syn/S14.html">Synopsis 14</a>, I can't figure out how that would work.</p>

<pre>role Bomb {
    method fuse ()    { say '3 .. 2 .. 1 ..' }
    method explode () { say 'Rock falls. Everybody dies!' }
}

role Spouse {
    method fuse ()    { sleep rand(20); say "Now!" }
    method explode () { say 'You worthless piece of junk! Why I should ...' }
}

class PracticalJoke does Bomb does Spouse {
    ???
}</pre>

<p>What have I missed?</p></p>

<p>Reading the Synopsis and the <a href="http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/t/spec/S14-roles/conflicts.t" title="pugscode.org">role conflict spectest</a pugscode.org> doesn't suggest anything other than resolving it yourself:</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>class PracticalJoke does Bomb does Spouse {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; method fuse() {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return self.Bomb::fuse();<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; method explode() {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return self.Spouse::explode();<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>}</tt></p></div> </blockquote>

Before Moose, Perl6 was the great hope to fix a lot of the ugliness with Perl's OO.  Perl 6 was like Perl 5 but more.  However with all the community effort going into Moose and related MooseX stuff, I'm concerned that a lot of the great ideas in Perl6 are going to always remain too fair behind. It's starting to seem like Perl6 is like Perl5 but different.  I wonder if there's some way to increase the communication between the Moose group and the people doing OO Perl6 stuff.  There's a lot of little things like the one you have described that just might not be something you realize you need until you are actually building production code.

<tt>Perl 5 is pluggable, and Moose is a great "external" improvement.<br><br>Perl 6 is (in the realm of object orientation without question) even better and more pluggable than Perl 5, and you wonder that the default isn't is as good isn't as good as Perl 5 with a bunch of the best modules available?<br><br>I think thats an understandable position, but don't forget that Perl 6 leaves room for improvement. It shouldn't be all that hard to write a module that allows additional syntax like<br><br> class Foo does SomeRole<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:except&lt;methods you want ignored&gt; {<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... }<br><br>We know that we're not perfect, which is why we leave much room for modifications later on.</tt>
