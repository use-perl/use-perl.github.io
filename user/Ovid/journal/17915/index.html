<h1>Linux WML Browser?</h1>

<p><p>Can anyone recommend a decent WML browser for Linux?  I installed the <a href="http://wmlbrowser.mozdev.org/">Mozilla WML Browser</a>, but it simply tells me it can't recognize the WML file.</p>

<p>I installed Opera, but our site requires certain User-Agent strings before it will send a WML page.  Opera's alternative User-Agent strings are fixed -- I haven't figured a way to override them.</p>

<p>I also tried <a href="http://www.pyweb.com/tools/">Deck-it</a> and it worked beautifully, but it didn't actually let me enter any information into our login page, thus not letting me login.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?  I'm pulling my hair out.</p></p>

Years ago I made Wapsilon. It still exists and probably does what you want. See wapsilon.com.<br> <br>It can be handy to have a site send the WML version to certain user agents, but ALWAYS make sure you have a URL that unambiguously selects the WAP stuff. Even some real WAP gateways do not send text/vnd.wap.wml in the Accept header and some don't send any User-Agent header at all. The preferred form for that WAP-only URL is wap.yourdomain.com<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

As the author of the Mozilla extension at wmlbrowser.mozdev.org, I'd be interested to know what went wrong.<br/><br/>Were you loading a file from the filesystem or over HTTP?<br/><br/>Are you installing onto Mozilla or Firebird/fox?

I ran Mozilla 1.5 as root, installed wmlbrowser (and everything appeared fine) and closed Mozilla.  I then relaunched the browser and in trying the the wmlbrowser tests at mozdev, my browser says gives the normal "do not know what to do with this filetype" message and offers to launch an external app or let me save the card.  It looks for all the world like wmlbrowser was never installed, but I couldn't tell from looking at the mozdev site where I would go to verify that.<br/><br/>I should add that relaunching the browser as root and trying to access the mozdev tests gives me the same error message, so again, it looks like nothing got installed, even though the install process ran fine.

<p>Do you see anything if you go to this location?
<code>chrome://wmlbrowser/content/wml.xsl</code>

</p><p>Do you have a file "wml-service.js" in the components directory of your Mozilla installation?</p>

Oops, forget about wml-service.js, that's not in 0.5.

<p>The chrome location gives me the following message:</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it. The document tree is shown below.<br> <br>-&lt;html&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;body/&gt;<br>&lt;/html&gt;</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>I get that for any xsl document name that I type in, though, so it looks like a standard error message for a missing xsl doc.</p>

That's weird. Can you email me at matthew [at] mjwilson [dot] co [dot] uk to discuss it further?

<p>I was about to release 0.6 but maybe there's something else I need to fix first.</p>

Turns out I can't even type my own email address.
