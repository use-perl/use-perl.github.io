<h2>Dispute the charges</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mock/">mock</a> on 2006-06-07T07:52:40</h3>
Did you pay by credit card?<br>
If so, did you get what you paid for? (obviously not, as you sound unhappy with the quality of the service delivered)<br>
If not, then dispute the charges with your card provider:<br> <br> <ul> <li>Simply phone the 800 number on the back of your card and say that you did not get what you paid for and would like to charge back.</li> <li>The visa/mastercard agent will take down your details, promise to send you the paperwork to fill out, and (most importantly) contact the merchant.</li>
<li>Since there are significant fees and fines for having too many chargebacks, most merchants will very quickly phone you up and try to come to some sort of agreement with you in return for your not charging back.</li>
<li>Demand satisfaction, or fill out the paperwork and get your money back</li>
</ul> <br>
I've found it's the best way to cause the most financial pain to an organization that has not met my expectation of service with the least personal effort on my part.  I've successfully used this on airlines before, although I've never had to take it all the way to its conclusion (they always cave).<br> <br>
I'm probably in some database as being a gigantic prick, this may or may not be bad.
