<p><p>Note:  from now on, until we get our official communication mechanism nailed down (we're working on it), I'll try to make sure that all TPF related announcements have a subject which begins with "TPF:".</p>

<p>With my stepping up to head the grant committee, I've had a number of issues I've needed to address.  One of the most pressing has been finding a dedicated grant manager for the Parrot project.  While I've temporarily filled this role, I have too many other pressing tasks to accomplish to be able to give this role the attention it needs.  <a href="http://nlnet.nl/">NLnet</a> has been a huge supporter and we've needed to communicate with them on a regular basis about the Parrot development.  We determined that we needed to meet the following criteria for a grant manager:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An individual who is both well-known and respected in the Perl community.</li>
  <li>Deep knowledge of Perl and has paid attention to the Parrot project.</li>
  <li>No conflict of interests (for example, this ruled out Jesse Vincent, the project manager).</li>
  <li>Was foolish, er, courageous enough to take on this challenge.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enter Dave Rolsky of <a href="http://masonhq.com/">Mason</a> fame.  Currently an employee with <a href="http://www.socialtext.com/">Socialtext</a>, Dave has agreed to handle this very important role.  Primarily he will be keeping abreast of the Parrot project and communicating with NLNet to let them know what's being accomplished.  Further, as the Parrot Grant Manager, he'll be the one deciding whether or not specific goals have been accomplished and money should be distributed.</p>

<p>Congratulations and many thanks to Dave on helping out!  Viva la Parrot!</p></p>
