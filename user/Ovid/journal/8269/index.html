<p><p>Walked out to my car this morning to find the driver's side door, gas tank, and trunk wide open.  Years ago, I had a car broken into twice in a month and decided to never leave anything valuable in my car again.  Whoever broke in missed the handful of parking change I had in a side pocket, but they were kind enough to haul off some broken electronics that I had in the trunk.</p></p>

though I had my car broken in only once. Nothing was taken but the inside lights were destroyed. And then my neighbour came and saw the guy who did it. And this idiot ran away towards the police station and my neighbour had called the police.
<br> <br>It was a matter of minutes until they had him. - It was a Junkie in search of anything that might pay for his next shot. He was after my car radio, but couldn't take it out.<br> <br>My insurance paid the damage, but it still was a hassle to get everything done.<br> <br>I hope your  insurance pays for the damage, Ovid.
