<p><p>You know, I honestly don't go looking for this stuff, but when I came up on Digg, I couldn't help but click.  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1083100102009309014&q=Scientology">The behavior of these scientologists is absolutely repugnant</a>.  How can anyone think that this insulting behavior, physical intimidation and general verbal abuse is appropriate behavior?</p>

<p>So I had to go looking and it seems <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1285400258786548">this isn't that unusual</a>.  It's apparently something called "bullbaiting", a term Hubbard co-opted.  One or more scientologists get very abusive and offensive to make others lose their temper.  If it's something that they practiced in house, that would be their business, but to subject others to it?  Disgusting.</p></p>

In their early days I suspect all religions have to go through this sort of thing. I suspect in 50 years there will be people trying to debunk the flying spaghetti monster too. All religion has to do though is wait a couple of thousand years and it becomes the absolute truth, and not under such attack. Scientologists just need to be a bit more patient.

<p><div class="quote">In their early days I suspect all religions have to go through this sort of thing.</div>  <p>Scientology isn't a religion. It is a cult, period. I also don't agree with the general principal of your statement either. I sense however you weren't trying to be truthful but baiting. Er, rats!</p>

The only difference between a religion and a cult is age and adoption levels.

<p>I take it you've never actually known anyone in a cult then.  It brings to mind the quote "Many people who dream mistake them for visions, but no one who has a vision mistakes it for a dream."</p>

The point is that those who aren't in the "religion" consider it a cult, while those who are in it consider it a religion (though I have no idea what Scientologists call Scientology).<br><br>The classic example being the Mormons - many people consider them a cult (because they exhibit some of the classic insular and strange properties of what one would traditionally call a cult), but those within the church certainly don't. And now that the church of latter day saints is "old", it is considered quite mainstream.<br><br>Frankly I think all religion (and cult) is hocus pocus brain washing in an attempt to gain money and power at the top, and acceptance and an easy answer at the bottom, so perhaps you'll disagree with me whatever I say based on that opinion<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>I restate then, that if you've ever seen <em>genuine</em> brainwashing and mind-control, you'll never mistake it for anything else.  To me, that is the genuine hallmark of a cult, not however much I or anyone else disagrees with them.</p>

<p>(Now if you want to talk about Christianity and cults, judge the belief system and the related practices based on genuine transformation of character of the adherents.  Are they becoming more loving, more generous, more compassionate, and more peaceful over time?  I assume that they claim that they should do such things.)</p>

<i>I restate then, that if you've ever seen genuine brainwashing and mind-control, you'll never mistake it for anything else.

Much less so than say the Moonies and the Heaven's Gate cults.<br><br>It's clear to me from history that a religion/cult becomes much less cultish over time. Christianity being the perfect example of this - no longer are people stoned for blasphemy, but there are people who are still still ostracized from the church for various stupid reasons (gay romance for one). Religions become more peaceful over time I guess, as people begin to recognise their flaws and rewrite history so that the flaws become less relevant (e.g. the New Testament vs the Old Testament).<br><br>I seriously think if you could travel back in time to the early days of Christianity you would see exactly the same kind of brainwashing as you see today for the modern "cults" of today. Unfortunately since History is written by those who succeed (and the church certainly did) we'll never truly know the truth.

It's not even a cult, really... more of a pyramid scheme, or a "get-happy-quick" scam.  "Take these costly courses from us and you'll be jumping around on a couch in no time!"
