<p><p>Okay, I'm stunned.  A long time ago I decided to learn how to use <tt>Devel::Dprof</tt> to <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=101786">profile some code</a>.  As a test, I took some code that I wrote and knew was fairly good and probably couldn't be improved upon.  I managed to improve its performance by about 30%.  Talk about a lesson in humility.</p>

<p>Now, I'm writing a bunch of tests for a system that, as of last week, had only one known bug -- and that was an intermittant one.  I'm only writing tests for those areas that I know I need to do work on, so the tests are limited in scope, but I now have about 147 of them.  In the process of this, I have uncovered numerous bugs, most of which have never been exposed because of our previous standard of testing things manually.</p>

<p>I just stumbled upon a bug that was <em>discarding</em> data and returning bogus results.  However, because our client hasn't been using this section of our application, they never noticed a problem.  I just can't believe it.  This is a system that's been running for years, constantly being tweaked, redesigned, extended, etc.  I'm kind of dumbfounded by these results.</p></p>

<i>However, because our client hasn't been using this section of our application, they never noticed a problem.</i> <br> <br>That's the risk of building ahead of what clients really need. You might build it, but what they actually need get the bulk of the testing, leaving little presents lurking in dark corners.<br>
