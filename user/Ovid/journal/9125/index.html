<div class="span8">
<p><p>Reinventing the wheel always gets one yelled at, but naturally I am doing it again.  I have found that maintaining <a href="http://users.easystreet.com/ovid/">my Web site</a> is a pain.  Naturally, I went on a search for Web content management tools with a few preferences in mind.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Easy to use.</li>
  <li>Not require server side code.</li>
  <li>Easy to use.</li>
  <li>Free.</li>
  <li>Easy to use.</li>
  <li>Well-written.</li>
  <li>Easy to use.</li>
  <li>Automatically generate a navigation bar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything that I found failed one or more of the above prerequisites.  <a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/docs/plain/Tutorial/Web.html#GENERATING_STATIC_PAGES">ttree</a> from <a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/">Template Toolkit</a> was the closest I found, but it doesn't appear to automatically generate the navigation bar the way that I want it to be done.</p>

<p>So I'm creating my own.  All I do is create a file in my <tt>source</tt> directory and it's added to the site and all appropriate nav bars are to be updated.  Do I want a new section added to the site?  I just create a new directory and add a file to it.  That's all.</p>

<p>As for the file format:</p>

<tt>[title]<br>
This is the title<br>
<br>
[body]<br>
&lt;p&gt;Insert the body of the page here.&lt;/p&gt;</tt>

<p>It's rather simplistic, but that's the point.  I don't want to learn some complicated Web content management system for a simple vanity site.  So far, I only have ~120 lines of code, but the bulk of the work is done.  My work on the dynamic navigation bar will take a bit more time, but other than that, it works perfectly creating all of the folders that I need and generates nice, valid HTML.  This should make further updates to my site rather painless. It would probably not be terribly useful for anyone else unless they already know Template Toolkit.  Further, <tt>$simple == $inflexible</tt>, but it does what I want it to do.  I can even override the default CSS and templates to customize the look and feel for every section.  I rock :)</p></p>

Darn.  I'm going to have to learn that PM != UP.  Gah.

Ain't that the truth.  If I had a nickel for every time I wrote a name or a keyword in square brackets here, then wished it would actually work....

<p>Since Portland Perl Mongers has been running again, I've missed only one of the meetings.  IIRC, that was the meeting where you presented the above.  Drat!</p>
