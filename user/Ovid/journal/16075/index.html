<p><p>wxPerl is beautiful.  One might reasonably ask why all other Perl GUI toolkits have not died a horrible death now that wxPerl exists.  The answer is simple:  try installing it.</p>

<p>I had heard that it was a pain to install, but now, after hours of searching, reading through failed compilation output and much googling, I have finally managed to compile and install it (after ignoring some mysterious "make test" failures) and can add my voice to the "it's a pain to install" crowd.  Still, it's beautiful and it appears to have a much nicer OO interface than Tk.  I'm just happy this is for a personal app and not something that I'd be forcing someone else to install.</p></p>

<h2>wxPerl on windows</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/kjones4/">kjones4</a> on 2003-11-30T07:14:15</h3>
The binaries for windows and ActiveState Perl worked beautifully. It took about 3 minutes to download and install. The wxPerl installer uses ppm which is nice.

<p>I'm on Redhat linux, though.  Trying to find the RPMs and install them was a pain.  For some reason, the wxGTK-devel* versions didn't always seem to have the header files and utilities that I needed.  Also, given that I am a relative newbie to linux only added to the fun.</p>

<p>While I don't miss Windows, I sometimes miss how easy it was to install stuff (shh<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... don't tell anyone I said that).</p>

Yes, I was just providing some encouraging words to Perl users on Windows who might think that installing wxPerl on Windows might be equally as difficult. I use Linux sometimes as well and the installation difficulties can be a pain at times. I played around some with the wxPerl examples. Very nice! I knew that wxWindows for Python was popular, but I had no idea wxPerl was so far along.

<h3><a href="/user/tinman/">tinman</a> on 2003-12-02T09:31:07</h3>
<p>Its probably just me, but somehow, I just havent been able to wrap my mind around doing wxWindows related stuff in Perl ? I still use Win32::GUI and/or Tk for the (very few) GUI apps that I write.
</p><p>wxPython, on the other hand, seems very natural to write code in.. probably some sort of mental block with the way objects were handled or something.</p>



<h2>Mattia also provides binary RPMs...</h2>

or did you not see those (or did they not work for you somehow)?

</p><p>
I think your pain comes from installing RPMs
(a lot of the traffic on the wxPerl mailing list is with people having trouble compiling it themself because they did  not download all the neccessary RPMs<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...).
</p><p>
I find it much easier to download wxWindows binary packages from the website, or just download the source and compile it myself.

And oh yeah, don't create wx* GUIs without <a href="http://wxglade.sf.net/" title="sf.net">wxGlade</a sf.net></p>
