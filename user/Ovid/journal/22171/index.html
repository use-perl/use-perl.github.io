<p><p>HTML text areas on the Mac leave artifacts all over the place and it makes it very difficult to know what I am typing.  It's even worse when I hit backspace and it leaves phantom characters.  Has anyone else had this problem?  This happens with Safari, Firefox and Camino.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>  I am now typing in IE 5.2 for the Mac and it works fine.  There's apparently a common broken widget that the 3 "useful" browsers share.  Damn.</p></p>

I've been using Mozilla for about two years on OSX and have not encounterd the problem you are describing.<br> <br>I've definitely not heard of it before and I'm pretty sure I would have if it was common.



<h2>10.2 problem?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/schwern/">schwern</a> on 2004-12-06T23:37:54</h3>
I vaguely remember this being a problem in 10.2.  Haven't seen it for a long time.  I'm typing this with Firefox 1.0 on OS X 10.3.6 right now.  Is your copy of OS X out of date?

<p>I'm on 10.3.6.  (Darn.  You had me excited there.)</p>

<h2>Works for me...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2004-12-07T02:31:48</h3>
Curious.  I've not seen that behaviour on any browser on any version of Mac OS X, and I've used most of the combinations.

<p>It's absolutely killing me.  I'm forced to use IE and it's killing me.  I just found out that theory didn't wipe the box but instead installed the current version of the top of the previous version.  I'm wondering if there is some conflict there.</p>

<h2>something else to blame?</h2>

I'm also 10.3.6 and use mozilla every day. No screen turds in textareas here<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:/<br> <br>Is this a relatively stock OS, or has someone installed assorted kernel extensions and whatnot?<br> <br>-matt
