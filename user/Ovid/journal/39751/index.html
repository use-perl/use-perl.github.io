<div class="span8">
<p><p>I started thinking again about why class methods silently override role (traits)
methods.  Since I see this pop up on mailing lists from time to time by
programmers getting hurt by this or a variant of this, I kept wondering why on
<em>earth</em> the <a href="http://scg.unibe.ch/research/traits">traits
researchers</a> would recommend this.  From <a
href=http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/phd/schaerli-phd.pdf">the original traits
paper</a> we have the following:</p>

<quote>Methods defined in the class take precedence over trait methods. This
allows the glue methods defined in a class to override methods with the same
name provided by the used traits.</quote>

<p>After pondering <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Ovid/journal/38809">the Perl
community debate on this topic</a>, I still couldn't see the point.  Sure, let
the class win, but silently?  That still doesn't make sense to me.  Finally,
knowing that any information I got from the Perl community would be
second-hand, I figured the only way I was going to get an answer would be to
email the original researchers and find out their reasoning.  I confess that their responses  held some surprises.  While the following is quoted from <a
href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/user/black/">Dr. Andrew
P. Black</a>, <a
href="http://scg.unibe.ch/scgbib?_k=EFHVFCHr&query=andrew+black+traits">one of
the primary researchers in this field</a>, the others in the discussion
generally appeared to agree with his explanations (the following quotes are all his and presented here with permission):</p>

<quote>Yes, it is really important that a programmer can see clearly when a
trait method is being overridden Ã¢â¬â just as it is important that it is clear
when an inherited method is being overridden.</quote>

<p>So there you have it, right from the original researchers:  class wins, but
<em>not</em> silently.  However, that raises the obvious issue of why this
wasn't explicitly laid out in their papers?  As it turns out, that's because they implemented this in Smalltalk.</p>

<quote>In Smalltalk, where a program is viewed as a graph of objects, the
obvious solution to this problem is to provide an adequate tool to show the
programmer interesting properties of the program.  The original traits browser
did this for Smalltalk; the reason that we implemented it is that traits were
really NOT a good idea (that is, they were not very usable or maintainable)
without it.  Since then, the same sort of "virtual protocols" have been built
into the browser for other properties, like "overridden methods".</quote>

<p>In short, the researchers felt traits would be a bad idea if the programmer couldn't explicitly see what was happening.  However, this tool support
is so integral to Smalltalk (<a href="http://www.squeak.org/">you really should check it out</a>), that adding
behavior to the tools is second nature.  The traits authors knew that this
information needed to be immediately in front of the programmer, so they
pushed it into their browser (kind of like the Smalltalk IDE) because that's as natural to them as a Perl programmer using <tt>map</tt> to transform a list.</p>

<p>When Smalltalk is in the browser, it's code, not just documents.
Smalltalk, a dynamic language, gets around many of the parsing issues which
Perl and other dynamic languages experience by having the code already
compiled.  You're not parsing a document, you're parsing the code.  So what
does this mean for languages where we parse documents?  (Such a thing tends to
be trivial in static languages like Java, but hard for dynamic languages):</p>

<quote>If, on the other hand, you view a program as sheets of paper rather
than objects, then the obvious solution is to add yet another language
feature.  So, Java, for example, realized (after about 10 years) that it
needed an overrides annotation, and a compiler enhancement to issue a warning
if a method overrides another without using the annotation.  So they extended
the language.  Similarly, I agree that if the normal Perl environment does not
provide good programming tools, then the implementation of traits for Perl
ought to have done something to make it clear that a class method was
overriding a trait method.</quote>

<p>Make of that what you will.  Personally, I don't use Perl::Critic and
that's where the "notify when class wins"  behavior was to be pushed (though I
don't see it on the CPAN), so that's pretty useless to me.  (<strong>Update</strong>: I phrased that very badly and I apologize to anyone I may have offended.  See note below).</p>

<p>I don't know that this will necessarily cause movement on anyone's part, but it's nice to know I wasn't totally insane in my reasoning (though I originally wanted this to be a composition failure and was willing to compromise on a warning).</p>

<p>Do you also want using 'sub foo {...}' to override a superclass method to be a compile-time failure or warning?</p><p>If not, why treat it differently than overriding a role method, other than one's comparative level of experience and familiarity with inheritance vs. with roles?</p>

<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2009-10-14T14:20:50</h3>
<p><div class="quote"><p>Do you also want using 'sub foo {...}' to override a superclass method to be a compile-time failure or warning?</p></div><p>Many language designers are now realizing that they need to be explicit in their code behavior.  For example, here's a Java method which should override a parent class method.</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>@Override<br>public int someObscureMethod() {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;return 1;<br>}</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>What if the parent class method takes an argument?  You've not overridden the method and you may very well get an extremely hard to debug error.  Now you can find out at compile time that this method isn't really overriding anything.  Here's the method in C#</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>public override int someObscureMethod() {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;return 1;<br>}</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>Again, you'll find out at compile time if you didn't really override anything.  You can also find out at compile time if a method overrides something but you <em>didn't</em> list it as overriding anything.  This is very useful for the programmer.  Now consider a common pitfall in C++:</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>#include &lt;iostream&gt;<br>using namespace std;<br> <br>class Base {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; public:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; void doit() {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt;"base class"&lt;&lt;endl;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>};<br> <br>class Derived : public Base {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; public:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; void doit()<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cout&lt;&lt;"derived class"&lt;&lt;endl;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>};<br> <br>int main() {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Base *a, *b;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; a = new Base();<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; a-&gt;doit();<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; b = new Derived();<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; b-&gt;doit();<br>}</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>That will print out "base class" twice, but that's not what you wanted.  You need to declare Base::doit as virtual to get a dynamic binding instead of a static one.  For a C++ programmer, when working in a derived class, the lack of annotation on the method can be very confusing and is apparently a common source of bugs, but at least by having the "virtual" keyword on the parent class you can see that it can be overridden (but it really belongs in the derived class).</p><p>You can also take a look at Eiffel for even more extreme instances where they strive to make things clear for the programmer.</p><p>In short, just because Perl makes it easy to screw up (did <tt>reciept()</tt> really override anything?) doesn't mean that it's a good thing.  Many other languages are realizing this<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I think hdp was asking an honest, simple question.  I think your answer is "yes, subclassed override should also warn if not marked," with added explanation.  Is that correct?</p><p>I have no strong feelings either way, although I'd rather all my existing code didn't go crazy with warnings.  I just wonder what your opinion is on other forms of method occlusion or augmentation.</p>

<p>Yes, that was my intended answer.  Many languages are moving to this, though I can see others resisting this idea.</p><p>As for "other forms of method occlusion or augmentation", I expect you're referring to things like the "before", "after", "around", "augment" and "inner" features from Moose.  "augment" and "inner" must go hand-in-hand, so that's immediately visible to the programmer no matter which of the augment/inner methods they see.</p><p>The others are silent "action at a distance" but they have the advantage that if you're attempting to modify a method which isn't there, you fail almost immediately.  That being said, the <em>receiving</em> method has no indication that it's being modified (same problem with AOP) and that's a bit disturbing, but at least you can see the roles you've composed in.  This is one case, though, where tool support in the IDE would be extremely useful.</p><p>I've wondered what it would take to mark a project and load it safely (ha!) in memory to allow the IDE (Padre?) to capture this information.</p>

<p>I'm very sorry I gave offense.  I didn't mean to, but it's clear I phrased that very badly.  I've just not been in the habit of using Perl::Critic.

I agree with Dr. Black on this point, but this is just language theory and not implementation details. It can be argued that reading the source provides this feature. Dr. Black goes on to say<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
</p><blockquote><div><p> <i>

Perl::Critic is a tool in the modern Perl environment that provides this, so therefore we don't have to resort to something more drastic. You however seem to reject that in this statement<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
</p><blockquote><div><p> <i>

Your conclusion (obviously) leans toward your desires, but I could just have easily had said "if they are not using Perl::Critic, they should be". If people are not willing to use the tools provided them (for free) then why should the core Moose team go out of their way to do still more work simply because someone chooses not to use another perfectly good tool?
</p><p>
In the end, and I have said this before, I think you are overusing roles.
</p><p>
While roles are an excellent replacement for multiple inheritance they possess many of the same (or similar) dead ends and pitfalls if used too heavily. It is my opinion is that using the alias/excludes feature is a code smell and that more than 3 roles being composed into a single class is a mild code smell that if not watched careful will turn into a full blown stink.
</p><p>
These are my opinions in the end so you can take them or leave them, but they are founded on many years of using roles in several big work projects, many CPAN modules and countless discussions had with others on IRC. I have probed the theory, but I have lived the practice.
</p><blockquote><div><p> <i>

I think at this point, the movement needs to be yours.
</p><p>
You will note <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/drolsky/Moose-0.92/lib/Moose/Manual/Contributing.pod#NEW_FEATURES" title="cpan.org">here</a cpan.org> that any new features for Moose <b>must</b> first be vetted through a MooseX module. At this point (thanks for rafl and others in the Moose team) role composition is now very hookable and you should find it much easier to create a MooseX module to so this now.

<p>It seems to me that it would be useful for Perl(5|6) to make method overriding explicit as Java has done.

And although most Java programmers use tools (Eclipse), the <code>@Override</code> syntax has still been added to the language itself. So when the tools are not part of the language (as Perl::Critic is not required to write Perl and Eclipse is not required to write Java), I think that a feature of the language should be provided for you to be explicit about when you're overriding a method.</p><p>If Ovid can demonstrate this as useful in a MooseX module, so much the better.</p><p>My $0.02.</p><p>--Theory</p>

<p>Who's going to start championing the patch to P5P that we need this feature in the Language?</p><p>One of Moose's driving goals (which we do lose site of occasionally) is that it is Perlish. This feature (right or wrong) is not how Perl currently interprets overriding inherited methods. There are several places where Moose tries to be more strict about things than default Perl (strict/warnings enabled by default for example, though 5.11 enables strict as part of "use 5.11") and several places where things that Stevan and most of the Moose Cabal would *want* to be more strict are specifically not because it's not the Perlish way (having new() die when called as an instance method for example).</p><p>This is one of those places where I would heavily suggest that we need to stick to where being consistent with the language is important. If Perl were to start warning about overriding methods in subclasses without an explicit notation, then I would *certainly* agree that Moose could and should start doing so for Roles. Because it doesn't I think it's improper for (default) Moose to impose that burden upon developers who use Moose.</p>

Well this is good to hear, perhaps all your examples of edge cases and oddities have skewed my perception of your code base. Although, your anti-inheritance stance does make me think perhaps you've gotten a little too drunk on the role kool-aid.
</p><p>
I guess my worry is that your not using <b>all</b> the tools at your disposal and therefore wanting to shape the tools you <i>are</i> using in such ways as to compensate. Inheritance is no more evil then roles when used properly, and delegation is sometimes a far superior solution then either of them. Hell, even multiple inheritance can still come in handy sometimes.
</p><p>
And while I agree that strictness of composition is useful, there is a tradition in the Perl community of giving you enough rope and Moose tries to strike a balance between enough rope and saving you from yourself. But the fact most of your issues stem from (what I perceive as) more extreme or uncommon usage patterns, it makes me think a MooseX module or optional "strict" setting is more appropriate.
