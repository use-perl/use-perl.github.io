<p><p>I've now installed the Firefox 1.5 Beta 1.  Most of my GreaseMonkey extensions broke, but it's definitely a faster browser and navigation is a tad easier.  I also noticed that the run time for my JavaScript tests has been cut in half, but I also rebooted, so perhaps there's something else going on.</p>

<p>In other news, I think I've figured out a temporary fix for <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Ovid/journal/26650">my Javascript testing problem</a>.  Since I've built static mockups of my dynamically generated forms, if I change how the forms are generated, my JS test could give false positives if I forget to update the static mockups.  Instead, I think I'll have my Perl tests generate an MD5 signature for my static forms and write that signature out to a file that the JS tests will read in.  If the signature doesn't match, I'll get an automatic test failure.  It's not perfect, but it's a quick and easy way to let me know if I've missed some static mockups :)</p></p>

<h2>Definately crisper</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2005-09-09T22:58:06</h3>
The only downside I've hit so far is that if it gets paged out (Win32) then it's REALLY slow to page back in.



<h2>Better Caching</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2005-09-09T23:32:16</h3>
<p>It appears to have much better caching, so going forward and back is faster.  It also no longer resubmits the request when viewing source.  I always forget about that when shutting down a test server and <em>then</em> trying to view source.  Very annoying!</p>

It also used to attempt to correct errors when you viewed the source, so it wasn't exactly what the server sent.  Also very annoying for debugging.
