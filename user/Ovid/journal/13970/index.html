<p><p>After a two-week trip to Vermont, doing some work for a small company out there, I'm finally home.  One of the things I was going to do while over there was offer some training on software testing.  However, they were so swamped that my testing presentation was delayed until a couple of days before I left.  What's worse, many of the people I was presenting to were C# programmers.  Talk about a tough crowd!</p>

<p>At the end of the presentation, I happened to mention that <a href="http://www.csunit.org/index.php">csUnit</a> is a tool that the C# programmers can use to test their code.  On the day before I was to fly out, one of the C# guys stopped me and asked me to look at something.  He took my advice and started using csUnit to tackle a large program that he was struggling with.  He started telling me how he was finding new bugs in his code and how his API is now improving.  While we were chatting, I could see that he was getting virtually all of the benefits about testing that I had promised.  I was very happy to see that I had an impact after all.</p>

<p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/gav/">gav</a> also said he was going to start testing.  Turns out he's a nice guy, too.  If you're ever in Burlington, VT, but him a beer (or five).</p></p>
