<div class="span8">
<p><p><small>Until the issues are sorted out with <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/">blogs.perl.org</a>, I'll still be posting here for a while (probably cross-posting for a while after, too).</small></p>

<p>Recently I've wanted a simple hash object:</p>

<pre>my $object = Hash::Object->new({
  id   => $some_id,
  this => 'that',
  name => 'john',
});

print $object->name; # john</pre>

<p>The problem is that current implementations I've found have limitations.  One uses <tt>AUTOLOAD</tt> so <em>any</em> method name becomes valid.  Another doesn't do that, but it also does nothing else.  I'd like to be able to autoinflate an object such that if I call an unknown method, it inflates the hash object into a full-blown object and redispatches to that object, only displaying a "Can't locate object method" error if the "inflated" version of that object doesn't provide the requested method.</p>

<pre>my $object = Hash::Object->new(
  data => {
    id   => $some_id,
    this => 'that',
    name => 'john',
  },
  inflate => sub { Customer->find({ id => shift->id }) }
);

print $object->name;

# inflates to full Customer object and redispatches method
print $object->fullname;</pre>


<p>The reason for this is that we sometimes have very expensive objects, but we only need one or two pieces of data from them.  It would be nice to return a "proxy" object, containing the data we <em>probably</em> want, but will transparently work like the real thing if needed.</p>

<p>This is on the CPAN, yes?  What's it called?</p></p>

<h2>What issues with blogs.perl.org</h2>

<p>Sorry to hijack your thread but I have just tried to register unsuccessfully for the last 10 minutes.  It keeps telling me the captcha text I am entering is wrong despite being 100% confident that I have it correct.</p><p>I am ready to abandon my journal here but can't seem to get registered there.  About the only thing I can see that might be an issue is that I am forced to use IE and the register page says "finished but with errors".</p>

<p>Right now it looks like it needs a lot more RAM.  Dave Cross and SixApart are working on that side of things.  We'll have it working, though.  It's just a matter of being patient.  And you're not the only person to tell me you're ready to abandon use.perl, so be patient and you'll be able to do so.</p>

<h2>Sounds familiar</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/revdiablo/">revdiablo</a> on 2009-11-23T19:34:05</h3>
<p>I asked a <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/revdiablo/journal/39633" title="perl.org">similar question</a perl.org> a while back.  The answers there may have what you're looking for.</p>



<h2>Other distributions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/JadeNB/">JadeNB</a> on 2009-11-23T20:40:18</h3>
I got very interested a while back, and stumbled on a slew of distributions that do similar things.  In addition to those that are mentioned in reply to revdiablo's post, would any of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/steffenw/Object-Lazy-0.06/lib/Object/Lazy.pm" title="cpan.org">Object::Lazy</a cpan.org>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/rclamp/Class-Delay-0.02/lib/Class/Delay.pm" title="cpan.org">Class::Delay</a cpan.org>, or <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/lembark/Object-Trampoline-1.26/lib/Object/Trampoline.pm" title="cpan.org">Object::Trampoline</a cpan.org> (obtained by searching for 'delay' on CPAN) do something like what you'd like?
