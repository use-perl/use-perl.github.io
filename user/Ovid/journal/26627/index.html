<h1>More Bad Job Ads</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>Since <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Adrian/journal/">Adrian been off on a rant the past few days about <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Adrian/journal/26368">bad</a> <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Adrian/journal/26410">job</a> <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Adrian/journal/26615">ads</a> and it's always a <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Ovid/journal/24933">favorite topic of mine</a>, I couldn't resist posting the <a href="http://jobs.perl.org/job/3031">the latest abomination</a>.  The note the following:</p>

<blockquote>Client interactions are important here, so good verbal communication skills/interpersonal skills are important, as well as strong abilities on the Tech side.</blockquote>

<p>That sounds fairly reasonable.  As one interviewer once told me, "I don't want an programmer I feel like I need to hide when clients come calling."</p>

<p>Then their true colors show:</p>

<blockquote>The business domain is IT Ops/Change Management and IT Access (request and access tracking). Dominant impacts on this space now are from Sarbanes-Oxley requirements. Other Ops apps may come into play, but these two will dominate.</blockquote>

<p>"Business domain"?  "Dominant impacts"?  "Other Ops apps may come into play"?  What the hell is this?  Is this some misguided parody?  A joke?  A research experiment to gauge the weakness of the economy by seeing who would be desperate enough to apply for this?  Let me reword this a bit for them.</p>

<blockquote>We are HR slaves.  You will work in a cube.  It will be an ugly cube.  Any attempts to streamline the bureaucratic process will be a violation Sarbanes-Oxley requirements.  Personality not required.</blockquote>

<p>Really.  These folks can't be that bad.  I rarely have worked for companies where people are so far gone that they're the automatons these ads imply, but do they actually <em>read</em> these things first?  Hiring managers often complain about just getting a resume.  They want to know there's a human being on the other end.  Well, so do prospective employees.</p></p>

Wow. That's beautiful.<br><br>Although it does back up their request for people with  "good communication skills".

<p>It also tells prospective employees that they had better love meetings 'cause there's going to be a lot of them.</p>
