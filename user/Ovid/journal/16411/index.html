<p><p>Remember Winston from 1984?  His job was to rewrite history to fit what the current administration wanted the public to believe.  Apparently, despite the tragic ending in the novel, he has been hired by the Bush administration.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A9821-2003Dec17.html">this Washington Post article</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The U.S. Agency for International Development has had information removed from its Web site which stated that our cost to rebuild Iraq would not exceed 1.7 billion dollars.</li>
  <li>The White House changed the headline "President Bush Announces Combat Operations in Iraq Have Ended" to include the word "Major" before "Combat".</li>
  <li>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and USAID have removed or revised fact sheets on condoms, excising information about their effectiveness in disease prevention, and promoting abstinence instead.</li>
  <li>National Cancer Institute, meanwhile, scrapped claims on its Web site that there was no association between abortion and breast cancer.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first deletion might arguably be justified -- why allow someone's erroneous statements on official Web sites where people might get confused?  The second item, if true, is straight out of 1984, but given this administration's playing curious shell game with the facts, I'm not surprised.  The last two items, though, truly disturb me.  Are government agencies not allowed to give us accurate and timely information if it conflicts with the political agenda of the current administration?  Already there have been complaints that references to homosexuality or studies of diseases associated with human sexuality are being frowned upon.</p>

<p>Anyone remember <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/65/ly/Lysenko.html">Lysenko</a>?</p></p>

<em>The White House changed the headline "President Bush Announces Combat Operations in Iraq Have Ended" to include the word "Major" before "Combat".</em> <br> <br>This is absolutely true.  However, the second headline was entirely accurate, while the first headline was false.  Bush never said that combat operations in Iraq had ended, he said MAJOR combat operations in Iraq had ended.  They fixed an error, because the headline said Bush said something he never said.  That hardly qualifies as revisionist history.  I can find no fault with it whatsoever.<br> <br>I suppose in the historical/journalistic purity sense, it would be nice to have a record of what the headline actually said the day it said it, but that's what archive.org is for.  Online news publications constantly change articles and headlines when they are found to be inaccurate.<br> <br>As to the last two items: politicians have been manipulating agencies like this for years.  They actually have control over these agencies.  That's the real problem, not specific instances of control being exerted.  Clinton had similar problems with a few agencies.<br>

<p>I stand corrected about the White House site changing the headline.  I did some research on the speech and you are correct, though it makes me wonder why they had an erroneous headline in the first place.  Since so many people merely scan headlines, it's easy to paint a false picture and then later claim "that's not what was said".  I've often had fun reading articles and seeing how closely they match the headline.  Frequently they don't and I think that is also a form of dishonesty.</p>

<p>I also agree that politicians have been manipulating agencies like this, but I don't recall it being so blatant (though maybe I'm only noticing it now since I've truly been disgusted with this administration).  Regardless of who does it, it's a deplorable action.</p>

<p>And on a side note, I realize that much of my journal might seem anti-conservative, but I don't think that's the case.  I would love to see true conservatives running the Republican party.  Despite appearances, I have no issues with conservative political philosophy.  It's the neo-cons and their neanderthal diplomacy and political tactics that I object to.  Of course, I'd also like to see some liberals in the Democratic party.  They've been pulled so far to the right that we have no effective opposition in this country.  Political  ideologies are great.  Political parties suck.</p>

<i>Political parties suck.</i> <br> <br>That's the truth.  So why wring your hands over their perpetual failure to<br>deliver democratic control of society?  Just admit that capitalist republics<br>don't deliver democracy, and look for something that does.<br>

<p> <em>Just admit that capitalist republics don't deliver democracy, and look for something that does.</em> </p>

<p>I can't admit that because I don't believe it.  From my perspective, there are three major things wrong with the US system:  money, media, and machines (political ones, that is).  The media is an obvious problem.  The yellow journalism of Fox News is just the most obvious example.  Make the media truly competitive or, better yet, permanently publicly fund the media as a public resource (rather than forcing them to kowtow to the dollar -- I'm still astonished at those who believe that huge mega-corporations are spewing liberal propaganda).</p>

<p>Money is insidious only in that it corrupts politicians, even those with good intent.  When your entire political future is dependant on getting corporations and PACs to give enough money, you have no choice but to dance to their tune.  Hopefully the recently upheld soft money ban will alleviate this, but I doubt it.</p>

<p>Also, having only two political parties -- one being Republican and the other being Republican Lite -- is a joke.  Unfortunately, without a proportional representation system, I don't know how we can fix this.  No matter how hard third parties push, they'll be trapped under the weight of the media and the money.</p>

<p>So I guess I can't throw in the towel yet.  There are many good things about this country.  We have wonderful internal freedoms, we are usually one of the first there when another country suffers a natural disaster and for those who live here, we have a relatively high standard of living.  Given this and many other positive things, I  don't want to chuck out the baby with the bathwater.</p>

From Mona Charen's 2003 book <i>Useful Idiots</i> pgs. 184-185:<br> </p><blockquote><div> <br>In 1997, CNN became the first Western news organization to open a bureau in Havana.  Those who hoped for an accurate glimpse of what life is like for ordinary Cubans were disappointed.  As the Media Research Center reported after studying five years' worth of dispatches from Havana, CNN reported on political prisoners and dissidents only seven times.  As Brent Bozell, MRC's president, told the National Press Club, "that's fewer than half as many stories as CNN produced in just the first three months of 2002 about phony claims of human righst abuses [committed] by the United States against those held at is base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba."  CNN also gave spokesmen for the Cuban regime six times as much airtime as noncommmunist spokesmen like church leaders or dissidents.  Similarly, wehn CNN presented the views of ordinary Cubans, they broadcast six interviews with those who supported the regime for every one with those who did not.<br> <p>Dissidents inside Cuba have attempted to use CNN's cameras to publicize their plight and their cause-often with disappointing results.  Though members of the press expend great efforts on behalf of their fellow journalists who face persecution in other parts of the world, Castro's repression of speech is permitted to go on in darkness.  Several hundred protestoers gathered in November 2000 at the home of Jose Orlando Gonzalez Bridon, a leader of the illegal Cuban Democratic Workers' Confederation, a would-be trade union.  A CNN reporter and camera crew were present, yet CNN never aired the footage.  CNN denied that their reporter had ever promised to televise the protest, but hte protesters who had risked a great deal to be there and who took that risk only for the chance to see their cause elevated by CNN, were bitter.  Later, many of those who attended the protest were beaten and jailed.<br></p> </div></blockquote> <br> <p>Yeah, those sound like the actions of conservative mega-corporation controlled media to me...<br> </p><p>You should read Mona Charen's book, or Bernard Goldberg's book <i>Bias</i>, which you criticized in another discussion without saying exactly why, for more examples of obvious liberal slant of the media.<br> </p><ul><li><i>... better yet, permanently publicly fund the media as a public resource (rather than forcing them to kowtow to the dollar<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</i></li></ul>  <br> <p>Sure, if we just gave control of all media over to the public, well, things would be sooooo much better.

Look, when I give my money to a PAC or an interest group or even a political party, it's because I want to exercise my rights to free speech, I want my opinions to be known.  Sorry, more opinions and free speech are not the problems, corrupt politicians are the problem.<br> </p><p>As it stands, there is nothing that can protect us from politicians who will be bribed.  Sorry, nothing, well, short of throwing them out.  Why don't we do that?  Well, oftentimes it's because they are being bribed by us, that's right, through our Unions, advocacy groups and contributions, we donate money to aid their campaigns.  All money isn't corrupting and only corrupt politicians accept money that is.<br> </p><p>Give up your hope that laws can keep politicians honest, because politicians control the laws.  The only thing that has a CHANCE of protecting us is a media that's as independent as possible from Government (read: public) control and you want to throw that away.<br> </p><p>I would be in favor of full disclosure laws that revealed where all the money to publicize opinions came from.

<p>It's been a long time since I picked up Bias and leafed through it, so I honestly can't tell you what my objections were at that time.  However, the media watchdog group "FAIR" has an <a href="http://www.fair.org/articles/bias-op-ed.html" title="fair.org">interesting piece about Golberg's book</a fair.org>.  I routinely check what FAIR has to say about a topic because they have impressed me with the thoroughness with which they research material.  In this particular case, they did not go through on a point-by-point basis, but I felt that there points were relevant.</p>

<p>For opposing views, look up works by Ben Bagdikian and Norman Solomon.  They are both great authors who produce very well-researched material.</p>

<p>As for my comments about publically funded media, consider that PBS used to produce more well-rounded content.  It was Richard Nixon who first felt that they were too biased and <a href="http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/wsas/departments/communication/students/res_rept.html" title="cuny.edu">worked to cut the funding of any programming that was critical of the current politics or values</a cuny.edu>.  Were this funding to automatically exist and be made separate from government content regulation, it would have a better chance of being an independant news source.  Of course, I doubt this well ever happen.</p>

<p>OK, I thought about responding to your points, but you and I will not see eye to eye on many issues and I'd be wasting my time.  I did, however, note that, while you didn't assert that AIM was reasonable, I suspect that this might actually be your point of view (though I certainly hope not).</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.aim.org/who_we_are/faq.html" title="aim.org">AIM's FAQ</a aim.org>:  <em>We encourage members of the media to report the news fairly and objectively--without resorting to bias or partisanship</em>.</p>

<p>Hoo boy.  That's a real howler.  From their article with the completely non-alarmist title "<a href="http://www.aim.org/publications/weekly_column/2003/12/10.html" title="aim.org">Howard Dean's Experiments on Children</a aim.org>", we find this charming quote:</p>

<blockquote><div>But the truth about Dean&#8217;s embrace of the radical homosexual agenda could put the former Vermont governor on the far, far left side of the political spectrum, even beyond the liberalism of Dukakis.</div></blockquote>

<p>"Radical homosexual agenda"?  Yeah, that's fair and objective.</p>

<p>And in another article entitled "<a href="http://www.aim.org/publications/aim_report/2003/21.html" title="aim.org">The FBI Gone Wild</a aim.org>", they refer to Hillary Clinton as "Senator Clinton, a ruthless First Lady whose political philosophy borders on Marxism".</p>

<p>"Ruthless"?  "Borders on Marxism"?  They must have a curious definition of fair and objective commentary.</p>

<p>In "<a href="http://www.aim.org/publications/aim_report/2003/19.html" title="aim.org">King's "Dream" Becomes a Nightmare</a aim.org>", they write:</p>

<blockquote><div>The major media deliberately concealed the facts about how the &#8220;civil rights movement&#8221; has degenerated into a collection of political extremists, homosexual militants, Muslim activists, and anti-American Marxists.</div></blockquote>

<p>That quote is typical of the blatant bigotry espoused by AIM.  Further, regarding all three of the quotes:  I didn't have to keep digging through the site to find them.  Just casual browsing picks up these and many other quotes which make it clear that the authors have an agenda that is not even remotely related to encouraging "fair and objective" reporting.</p>

<p>Reading through AIM makes it clear that they have a racist, homophobic, and thoroughly far-right view of the world and anyone who disagrees with them is not "fair and objective".</p>

I wish you had put this part at the beginning, so I didn't have to waste time reading the rest.  Who is "the media"?  Does every single member of the group have this "hatred"?  Is it always (or necessarily) irrational?  Does "everything" get spun, and do <b>all</b> Democrats get a "complete" pass?  I suspect we disagree on the underlying politics, but hopefully most readers can recognize that these gross partisan generalizations are completely absurd, and almost necessarily false.  They add nothing to your comment; if anything, they render the rest suspect.

<p>I almost didn't answer this because I really wanted to withdraw from this thread (but if I can't take the heat I should stay out of hell).  However, you asked a fair question and I think it deserves an answer.</p>

<p>A good primer on the topic is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0818405619/qid=1072157290/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-4757613-6254305?v=glance&amp;s=books" title="amazon.com">Unreliable Sources</a amazon.com> by Martin Lee and Normon Solomon.  It was published back in 1991 one and explained very thoroughly the problems with media consolidation over a decade ago.  <a href="http://www.progressive.org/mcc1199.htm" title="progressive.org">The problem has become worse due to increased media mergers</a progressive.org>.  We're all familiar with monopolies -- a market where there is only one supplier of a good -- but as Microsoft has amply demonstrated, you don't have to have a pure monopoly in order to profitably engage in monopolistic behavior.</p>

<p>As a general benchmark, economists frequently consider an industry in which five or fewer suppliers control in excess of the fifty percent of the market to be very monopolistic.  According to the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index%3Dstripbooks%26field-keywords%3DThe%2520Case%2520Against%2520the%2520Global%2520Economy/104-4757613-6254305" title="amazon.com">The Case Against the Global Economy</a amazon.com> (weird choice of light reading for me, eh?), with the waves of mergers that really started to take off in the 80s, we are now in a position where five companies control forty percent of the global market in media.  We are very close to a monopolistic media market and the results are highly predictable -- a lack of competitives, high barriers to entry and lack of innovation (in this case, good news reporting).  Many people argue that the Internet automatically creates a low barrier to entry, <a href="http://www.it-analysis.com/article.php?articleid=1660" title="it-analysis.com">but research tends to show that most surfers stick to a handful of sites</a it-analysis.com> and much of what is available is ignored in favor of the 'Net giants like Yahoo! AOL and MSN.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/006055973X/qid=1072159752/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-4757613-6254305?v=glance&amp;s=books" title="amazon.com">The Silent Takeover</a amazon.com>, economist Noreena Hertz describes how Adbusters produced an ad for the 1997 "Buy Nothing" day.  They wanted to show it in the US but ABC, CBS and NBC refused to sell them airtime.  Richard Gitter, the vice president of advertising standards at NBS said "We don't want to take any advertising that's inimical to our legitimate business interests".</p>

<p>I could cite plenty of other examples, but run over to Greg Palast's site and <a href="http://www.gregpalast.com/columns.cfm?subject_id=10&amp;subject_name=Media%20%26%20Free%20Speech" title="gregpalast.com">read what he has to say about media monopolies and free speech</a gregpalast.com>.  Too many people sit and home and watch the nightly news and don't notice how much of it is dedicated to covering the local mall, talking about a new store or covers mainly "sizzling" stories since many important ones don't sell well.</p>

<p>One more question, I promise!  You don't have to answer if you don't want.  I'm not sure I like the answer.</p>

<p> <em>If there were competition, how many people would notice and how many would change their media consumption habits?</em> </p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Major</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2003-12-24T17:43:12</h3>
<p>The short (and cheap) answer is I don't know if people would notice and if things would change.  If competition led to better quality news but people still chose sizzle over steak, that would be a disappointment, but at least people would be freely choosing instead of having the choice made for them.  There is good information out there now, but it's <a href="http://www.projectcensored.org/" title="projectcensored.org">not always easy to find it</a projectcensored.org>.</p>

<p>A more accurate answer would be to discuss <em>why</em> I desire more competition -- or more precisely, a different sort of competition (nice of me to casually shift the debate via clarifications, eh?).  But before I describe that, I should discuss my rationale.</p>

<p>Virtually all economists argue that free access to information is a prerequisite for a properly functioning market (there's a branch of economics called <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Information.html" title="econlib.org">information economics</a econlib.org> that explores the cost of information).  Adam Smith said this.  David Ricardo said this.  Milton Friedman said this.  John Keynes said this.  No one questions the importance of the availability of information.  The worse the information, the worse the market.  This is much of the reason why command economies fail.  The farmer sees that he's getting too much rain and reacts accordingly -- unless he has quotas set for him months ago by a central government that couldn't foresee the weather.  You wind up with stores with no bread but an abundance of socks.</p>

<p>Conversely, the better the information, the better the functioning of a given market.  This is part of the reason why Extreme Programming can work so well when applied to an appropriate project.  The roles of all of the actors are well defined as is the flow of information between them.  Easy access to quality information is necessary for effective decisions whether we're dealing with the small scale or the large.</p>

<p>While the tie-in to the media is obvious, it's not obvious how increased competition will improve the situation.  Even though there used to be more competition within the media, the yellow journalism of Hearst was easily on par with what Fox is pumping out today.  In another example, Robin Anderson, reported in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0813315425/qid=1072285025/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-4757613-6254305?v=glance&amp;s=books" title="amazon.com">Consumer Culture and TV Programming</a amazon.com>:</p>

<blockquote><div>A study of women's magazine in the period 1983 to 1987 revealed that not one magazine that carried cigarette advertising published any full-length feature, column, review, or editorial on any aspect of the dangers of smoking.  During the same period lunch cancer was determined to be the number one killer of women, surpassing even breast cancer.</div></blockquote>

<p>Noreena Hertz reports an NBC story in which GE engineers in a nuclear power plant discovered that one out of every three bolts that a major supplier was sending them was defective.  GE had been accepting those bolts for eight years before discovering this.  GE killed the story.  Similarly, an ABC story revealed that Disney had allegedly hired pedophiles at one of their theme parks.  That's not just steak, that's sizzle to boot (as the Michael Jackson story demonstrates).  However, ABC never ran that report.  Disney owns ABC.</p>

<p>These are all significant news stories.  This is information that might change how you shop.  It might change how you vote.  It might do plenty of things, but it won't if you don't have a change to hear about it.  And those anecdotes are not alone.  Many books have been written about the stories that corporate dominated media is suppressing.  It makes you wonder how many stories we <em>didn't</em> hear.</p>

<p>The problem lies in the inherent conflict of interest with how the media currently exists in our country.  Frequently, managers are prohibited from hiring family.  Judges are to recuse themselves when they know the defendant.  Politicians are supposed to divest themselves of holdings that might unduly influence their political decisions.  While the media often jumps to point out these issues, you don't hear them taking themselves to task.  This puts the public in the awful situation of being dependent on the media to tell us what's wrong with the media.  It's like that silly interview question "what's your worst habit?"  "I work too hard."</p>

<p>When Jesus said a man cannot serve two masters, one might be forgiven for thinking that he was prophesying about today's media.  The media is there for the public -- a public which needs this information to make good decisions -- but it's either owned by huge conglomerates like Disney and GE, or it earns the bulk of its revenues from advertising.  The effect of this conflict of interest in readily apparent when people dig for it, but instead, media giant <a href="http://www.clearchannelsucks.org/" title="clearchannelsucks.org">Clear Channel</a clearchannelsucks.org> warns of liberal media domination and the pretty blond on the nightly news stares at us through sea anenomes of mascara while commenting about the new store in the mall.</p>

<p>As for what a different sort of competition might entail, I'll leave that for others to sort out.  I've written enough and, I'm sure, some will be upset with what I have to say.  I've done enough for a Christmas Eve morning.</p>

<p>Happy holidays. (and I do mean that sincerely)</p>

The main problems with the media are far greater than simple bias or "yellowness."  Ben Franklin's newspaper was horribly biased and sensationalistic, by our standards.

It's not that money itself is bad, it's that the only way to be in power is to have a lot of money.  And your concerns about the soft-money bans are well-founded: they will have no impact.  Now the PACs will spend the money themselves, with LESS accountability, instead of giving it to the candidates.  And we try to lessen the negative impact of this by<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... infringing on free speech, by disallowing advertising a certain number of days before an election!  It's a ridiculous bill.<br> <br>What I really want to see is a complete lift on spending limits, with 100%, immediate, reporting.  I think if individuals can give more, then that will allow more voices in the process.  And if we try that and it doesn't work, then, we clamp down and say all money comes from the government, so everyone is on equal footing.  No limits, or complete limits, one way or the other has GOT to work.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>No, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't make cars safer or educate people about car saftey features. Just because we teach people not to drive recklessly doesn't mean we don't also tell them to wear seatbelts, and doesn't mean we don't install airbags in their vehicles.</p>

<p>I agree with you here. Indeed, that's the way sex education was done in my school. The resounding message was "Abstinence is the only 100% safe method. However, here are many other methods which have varying degrees of protection against pregnancy and STDs, and here's how they compare."</p>
<p>Education about this kind of thing should not be an either/or. People need information about abstinence, condoms, and other methods of protecting themselves against pregnancy and STDs. Promoting abstinence is wonderful, but that doesn't mean you should throw out all your information about condom effectiveness.

As for statistics...I used to have plenty of these sorts of discussions, and have found nothing productive comes from them, least of all the sensation that I've been in gladatorial contest.  (A feeling of nausea combined with adrenaline rush, if you're curious.)  I would ask for sources, I would question 'correlation' and 'related to', point out that statistics tend to mean a lot less than they appear to, etc., but it's really not worth it.  You may have ready answers, ready sources, ready whatever, but might eventually admit again that there's not a conclusive link.

Were this a discussion between doctors or biologists, I might see worth in pursuing it.
