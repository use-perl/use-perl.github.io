<p><p>I'm kind of shocked.  I've always heard rumors that I had another couple of siblings in Scotland, but I didn't know if they were true and I didn't even know what gender they might be.</p>

<p>Today I found out I have a sister (and possibly a brother) there.  I sent my new sister an email just now.</p>

<p>I can't even begin to describe how I'm feeling.</p></p>

<p>wow.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell this is the sort of occasion where you're expected not to know what to feel/you're feeling.</p>

<p>I also can't help noticing once again how the internet shrinks the world.</p>

<p>My wife had a similar experience a few years ago when her sister called her out of the blue.  Like you, she had heard rumors of other children, but her my wife's dad had denied it.  Her sister had found their dad few months before calling.  Soon, we all met and found out she grew up a few houses down from the one I grew up in.  The Internet isn't required for a small world.</p>
<p>The shocker my wife got this past year is that there is at least one more sister out there that she hasn't found yet.</p>

Oh, I meant that remark as in that he fired her an email; without the 'net, even considering the telephone, it would probably have taken much longer to establish any form of contact.
