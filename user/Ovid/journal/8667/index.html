<p><p>I finally got off my duff and wrote a module for work that does a much better job of handling CGI data.  It's customized to work for how we do things, so rather than having a general purpose tool, I have something that does what I need it to do.  Now, rather than worry about the tedious work of grabbing a bunch of form data and untainting all of it, I just list the fields I want, supply regex filters for those fields and I get a  hashref of untainted data back.  For my first test, I took a program that was about 450 lines of code (over half of that was munging form data) and reduced it down to 150 lines of code.</p>

<p>Curiously, this happens to dovetail nicely with some planned upgrades to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/OVID/CGI-Safe-1.24/">CGI::Safe</a>.  That particular module, while being well-intentioned, simply is not yet useful enough to generate much interest.  Hopefully, this will turn the trick and make Web programming safer.  Of course, if anyone is willing to take a look at it and recommend changes necessary to make it work under mod_perl ... (yes, that was a cry for help!).  Since we're a Windows shop (slowly migrating to Linux), I've never had the chance to dig deeply into mod_perl.  In fact, I only have one mod_perl site that I've ever built and that was for some internal demos.</p></p>
