<div class="span8">
<p><p><tt>Games::World</tt> now has words implemented.  The basic process of creating a world feels rather religious in nature as the following steps must occur in the following order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the beginning, Ovid created the words</li>
  <li>Then He divided place from place and gave them names</li>
  <li>Then He populated the land with all sorts of Wondrous Things</li>
</ol>

<p>You can't create a thing unless you have a place (room) to put it and if you haven't named it properly, everything dies a horrible death.  Even synonyms are handled correctly now.  My next tasks will be to add paths from room to room and after that to add a player.  Now it's the work week, though, so I suspect I won't get much done for the next few days.</p>

<p>After the player, I'll probably take a stab at the natural language interface and create a small area to wander and play with the stuff there.  From there, I'll have to start adding "monsters".  As I want them to move about and behave roughly intelligently, I am thinking about giving them very, very tiny neural networks.  They'll have to be small pre-tuned networks, though, as Perl is not going to be fast enough to teach them.</p>

<p>I also have about 91% test coverage (yup.  That includes POD).</p></p>

<p>But playing god is what programmers always do, no?</p>

<p>I think this is in fact a basic allure of programming: that rather than creating artifacts in the existing cosmos, the way everyone who creates something physical does, programmers create universes of their own. They&#8217;re usually extremely limited universes that consist of few entities with complex interactions, mind you, but universes nonetheless. (The cosmos works the other way around: innumerably many particles interacting in just four very simple ways to create everything we see.)</p>



<h2>Natural Language</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/kelan/">kelan</a> on 2005-11-01T14:57:51</h3>
I haven't looked at the source myself, but <a href="http://mooix.net/" title="mooix.net">Mooix</a mooix.net> has a natural language processor for commands. I think much of  the NLP is written in Perl, as well. The development of the whole has dropped off from what I can tell, but the NLP might be in good shape. I've never used it, it was just something that caught my attention once.
