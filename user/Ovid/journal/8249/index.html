<p><p>One of my coworkers, I'll call him Bob, has recently had to ask a roommate to move out over non-payment of rent.  He's been searching for another roommate and is concerned that he'll have trouble finding one who is receptive to living with a musician.  After doing a bit of searching, he located someone who wasn't interested, but recommended a friend who had a musician friend who was also looking for a roommate.  Bob called the referral and discovered that the "musician friend" was Bob.  He wound up being referred back to himself.</p></p>

I don't know first-hand if the <a href="http://portland.craigslist.org/" title="craigslist.org">Portland Craigslist</a craigslist.org> is any good, but a glance at it shows that there is a decent number of posts for apartments available and wanted. I believe that posting apartment listings is free, so I don't suppose it can hurt too much for "Bob" to check it out. All he's got to say is "Musician with apartment seeks roommate"

<p>Craigslist is an online institution for San Francisco Bay Area locals (see <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/" title="craigslist.org">www.craigslist.org</a craigslist.org>). Since I've been in Los Angeles for the past few months, I've found that the <a href="http://losangeles.craigslist.org/" title="craigslist.org">L.A. Craigslist</a craigslist.org> is getting to be quite good also. YMMV (or maybe BMMV - "Bob's Mileage May Vary")</p>

I have had great success with the Boston verson of Craigslist. When we moved to a smaller apartment and had to sell some stuff, nearly everything was sold via Craigslist. So I can at least recommend <a href="http://boston.craigslist.org/" title="craigslist.org">boston.craigslist.org</a craigslist.org>
