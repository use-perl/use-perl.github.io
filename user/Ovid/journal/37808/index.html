<p><p>Realizing that the past couple of days have probably proved distracting for some, you may not have heard the news that <a href="http://www.parrot.org/news/bbc-joins-parrot-foundation-advisory-board">the BBC has joined the Parrot Foundation Advisory Board</a>.  We've been working on this for quite a while, but as one might understand, there were various issues which needed to be settled before we could make this happen.</p></p>

Congratulations.</p>

<p>Thanks Andy.  It took a while to make this happen, but I'm quite relieved that it's gone through.  I do feel a bit awkward that my name is plastered all over the BBC quote (I'd rather it had been more BBC-centric), but that was actually a decision taken at a higher level than mine, so there wasn't much of a choice in the matter.</p><p>Note that the views expressed here are strictly my own and not those of the BBC.</p>
