<p><p>Given how assinine many computer laws seem to be (the ones in Oregon are exceptionally pitiful -- go ask merlyn), it should come as no surprise that one of my favorite whackjobs, Orrin Hatch, seems to think it's OK to destroy the computers of those who illegally download software.  While I suspect that there are few people out there with absolutely <em>nothing</em> illegal on their systems, I suppose it's only fair to ask if Orrin Hatch has any illegal software on his system.  After all, that would make him a bit of a hypocrite, wouldn't it?  Or would it just mean that Mssr. Hatch, like so many other lawmakers, is totally clueless about technology.</p>

<p>While I don't know if he's a hypocrite or just clueless, it was fun to read about his <a href="http://amish.blogmosis.com/archives/012511.html#012511">Web site's illegally downloaded code</a>.</p></p>
