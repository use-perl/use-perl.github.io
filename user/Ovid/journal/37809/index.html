<p><p>If there's any doubt as to why the Republicans have done so poorly in this election, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/3383784/John-McCain-praises-Barack-Obama-in-graceful-concession-speech.html">just look at John McCain's gracious concession speech</a>.  He was decent.  He was a gentleman.  His "supporters" often booed him and shouted obscenities.  Until people on <em>all</em> sides start realizing that those they disagree with are worthy of respect and consideration, we're going to continue down this torturous path.  I think most Republicans are decent people I merely disagree with.  It's the extreme ones who accuse Obama of being a socialist or Marxist, of having terrorist sympathies or of threatening to tear our country apart who are the real threat to us right now.  I think they're finally being marginalized, but Fox News, Rush Limbaugh and others are there to keep the flames of hate alive (that being said, I'm very impressed that some news people at Fox News are publicly battling the more offensive elements of the extreme right).</p></p>

<p>Very true</p><p>
I thought his speech was really good. He did a great job of trying his best to build bridges. I think he would have done better if he would have controlled the strange right wing attacks coming out of the party. Those type of attacks just don't seem like him. But I'll say I'm happy that we have a new leader that is able to publicly speak well and who has some charisma.</p>

Likely true. And most of those most people probably don't watch O'Reilly (who lays into everyone), and seem to forget about Colmes sitting across the table from Hannity. But, they don't say anything about MSNBC. 3 hours a day is Olberman, Maddow and Mathews, which is 1/4 of the day being pretty unfettered *far* left (think Hannity's America, for 3 hours a day instead of an hour on the weekend). Actually, more than 1/4 since they re-run the programming.

<p>It never ceases to amaze me when people in the US, enjoying what is possibly the furthest right democracy in the industrialized world, talk about the "far left" in America.  What constitutes the far left in the US often amuses political commentators the world over (seriously -- I've seen news commentators laughing over here when this topic comes up).  As a bit of comparison, here are some positions one politician here in the UK advocates:</p><ul>
<li>Make Britain greener (and urged people to see "An Inconvenient Truth")</li><li>Support gay and lesbian civil partnerships</li><li>Protect the NHS (their socialized medicine) from budget cuts</li><li>Appeared to oppose privatizing NHS</li><li>Levy higher taxes against carbon-producing companies</li><li>Support more family-friendly working conditions, including money for childcare</li><li>Opposed blindly cutting taxes</li><li>Opposed national ID cards as a threat to civil liberty</li><li>Pursue a foreign policy that doesn't slavishly follow US foreign policy</li></ul><p>Of course, if a US politician were to make such statements, they would immediately be branded a far-left liberal whack job. &nbsp;Fox News would be after him like hounds chasing, well, a fox. &nbsp;Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and many others would be mocking him. &nbsp;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5407714.stm" title="bbc.co.uk">But this speech was by David Cameron</a bbc.co.uk>, the leader of the UK conservative party.</p><p>There is no "far left" in the US unless the US narcissistically compares its left wing to its right wing.</p>

<p>
But, it's all relative. If you were to compare the "liberals" in Iran, they would be on the "right" compared to US liberals. So yes, the US compares its right to its left, since they are our right and left.

<p>The analysis you link to makes no such "balance" claim, and instead says:
</p><blockquote><div><p>On the Fox News Channel, the coverage was both more negative toward Obama and more positive toward both McCain and Palin than we found in the press generally.</p></div>
</blockquote><p>
But, leaving that aside, the very idea that the press should be "balanced" between candidates (or parties) in deeply flawed to begin with because it proceeds from the idea that positive and negative coverage should be doled out in equal measure irrespective of what the candidates (or parties) actually do.
</p><p>
Let's say that you and I are running for the same office. You're a strong candidate at the helm of a disciplined and persuasive campaign, whereas I'm terrible on the stump and staffed by haphazard fools. Should the press ignore my many gaffes in order not to be "too negative"? Should they expend extra effort to find something negative about your otherwise positive campaign in order to keep the coverage "balanced"? Of course not.
</p><p>
I'd normally leave your comment unremarked but I think the faux-objectivity and false symmetry that reduces journalism to a "balanced" game of "on the one hand/on the other" is precisely what's wrong with the press generally.

I don't think it should be 50/50 pos/neg for every candidate, that'd be silly. But, when a news agency is just as negative and just as positive to both sides, I think it shows balanced coverage.
<p>
The quote you say, I think you're mis-reading. It's saying Fox was more negative to Obama compared to the other networks which were MUCH more positive to him. And, they were more positive to McCain compared to the MUCH more negative reporting from the others. It's not saying Fox was more negative to Obama and more positive to McCain being unbalanced. Look at the graphs, Fox was 40% negative to both. Then, look at MSNBC who was 73% negative to McCain and 14% negative to Obama. There's your balance. 73% and 14%, not so much.</p>

Again, you're ignoring Colmes and all the centrist/liberal views Fox constantly has on. Why exactly is it you'll say Fox spews hate, but I guess what Olbermann and Maddows says is always loving? You want to say Fox is biased, yet the Pew research shows the other networks have done less than balanced coverage.
<p>
<cite>
but they choose to continue employing someone whose bias is worn on his sleeve
</cite>
</p><p>
So, if Fox should fire Hannity, I guess MSNBC should get rid of Olbermann and Maddow and Mathews, right? You're being about as un-balanced as you claim Fox is. Actually, Fox should ax Colmes too, since he wears his liberalism on his sleeve.
</p><p>
And, for the record, I'm pretty sure hannity.com isn't a FNC website. I think he's still allowed to put whatever poll he'd like on his personal website.
</p><p>
I'll also point out that Hannity, Colmes, Olbermann and Maddows are commentators. They aren't reporting the news, they are talking about it and expressing their opinions. If a network has commentators which aren't to your liking, don't watch. But, as I originally said, the Fox bashing is simply old, tired and narrow.

<p>Not watching TV and only seeing Youtube clips, I miss out on a lot of stuff.  I do see Olbermann and while I liked him at first, I don't any more.  He's ridiculous, but I have seem him, Maddow or Matthews spewing hate.  (Actually, while Olbermann and Maddow are clearly biased, what little I've seen about Matthews suggests that he's merely a pretty serious about his questions and doesn't allow the person he's interviewing to give him BS).  However, I have a particular distaste for Fox for reasons I've stated and which you're free to disagree with.</p><p>I'm just disappointed where I made a post to say nice things about McCain and Republicans in general, trying to make it clear that they shouldn't be defined by the extremist viewpoints which keep popping up, and yet this got sidetracked by a disagreement over my Fox "terrorist fist bump" News comment.</p><p>If you want to follow up, that's fine, but if I don't reply, I hope you won't take it personally.
