<div class="span8">
<p><p>Not having played with C#, I can't comment on it other than to say that a number of people I respect have given it a thumbs up.  I can't help but wonder if Java 1.5's autoboxing, generics, improved <tt>for</tt> loop and other features are a result of C# competition or if this an example of Sun really paying attention to some things needed in the language?</p>

<p>The autoboxing really strikes me as significant.  Mixing primitives and objects in the language has long been one of the largest sources of complaints about the language.  Autoboxing seems like a hack instead of going with a flyweight pattern, but it's better than ignoring the problem (and I can't say that I know enough about the technical reasons for the decision).  Still, I can't help but shake the feeling that Sun is behaving a bit like Microsoft here.  Once MS dominated the browser market, they pretty much stopped developing IE.  Sun, having developed a hugely popular language, seemed content to ignore some of the crufty features -- until C# started giving them the boot.</p>

<p>Now I wonder when they're going to fix their silly inheritence issues.  Interfaces can help, but they were only a partial solution to the multiple-inheritance issues.  I wouldn't be surprised to see Sun come up with proposals for multiple inheritance, mixins, or traits.  I think Java is finally getting interesting.</p></p>

<h2>absolutely a response</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lachoy/">lachoy</a> on 2004-01-07T01:56:05</h3>
IMO these are absolutely a response to C#. Most people in the open source Java communities I run in seem to think so as well. I don't think this is a bad thing -- hopefully this will become a virtuous cycle where both languages innovate -- well, for a limited definition of innovate<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) -- and force each other to be more responsive to the day-to-day users.

<p>I think most of the innovation in Java is bubbling up from (surprise!) the opensource community. For instance, there are a number of projects that implement mixins -- I know this is an intentional side effect of the AOP framework <a href="http://nanning.codehaus.org/" title="codehaus.org">Nanning</a codehaus.org>. I feel pretty confident in saying that Java will <b>never</b> have multiple inheritence<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p><p>There's also quite a few projects to create light(er)weight languages using the JVM. Most recent is <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/" title="codehaus.org">Groovy</a codehaus.org>, which seems to be deeply influenced by Ruby's syntax and usage. (Spoken as someone who has had only the briefest exposure to Ruby...)</p>

Use perl.  Use ocaml.  Use C.  These were all designed by people with actual<br>problems to solve.  (well, okay, ocaml does have some degree of silly<br>academicness to it . . .<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>Java and C# are silly corporate-PR-hyped things.<br> <br>For what application would either Java or C# be better than one of {perl, ocaml,<br>C}?<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; perl:  super-compact notation (perl -pe is the super-sed)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ocaml: speed, correctness, quite compact notation<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; C:     total control, no surprises from the compiler<br> <br>



<h2>Multiple Inheritance</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/RobertX/">RobertX</a> on 2004-01-07T13:26:06</h3>
<p>That will (and I think rightly so) not be in the Java language anytime soon.</p>

<p>I think the improvements are a little of both Sun listening and C# competition.</p>

<p>Perl is great and I use it. Try writing a really huge application in it and still maintain your sanity. : )</p>

I would rather use perl than java for any-size program.<br> <br>One of the important factors, of course, being that the program expressed as<br>perl code would be much less huge.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br>
