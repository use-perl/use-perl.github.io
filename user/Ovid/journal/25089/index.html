<p><p>I had it pointed out to me that today is my <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=17000">5th anniversary</a> of giving questionable advice on Perlmonks.  It's also the 18th anniversary of my moving to Hawaii and subsequently becoming homeless.  Ah, memories.</p>

<p>And you may have known that the MIT textbook <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> is online, but did you know you can download <a href="http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/">video of the lectures</a>, too?</p></p>

The fez, it haunts me!

<p>That's no fez!  That's my wife!</p>

<p>OK, it wasn't funny the first time, either.</p>

<h2>SICP</h2>

MIT has graciously put up a texi2html conversion of SICP, but if you ask google nicely, you should be able to find texinfo and pdf versions as well.  Paul Graham's <i>On Lisp</i> is also transcribed into texinfo, which converts to PDF well enough.
<p>
Actually, both of these are available via darwinports:

<li> <a href="http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/darwinports/dports/lang/sicp/Portfile" title="opendarwin.org">SICP</a opendarwin.org> </li>

</ul>

Reading SICP reminds me of something Paul Graham<br>wrote about starting to hang around the MIT AI<br>Lab. He was impressed with how fast they talked.<br>He said the secret is not to think any faster,<br>just use more words.<br>Did I get the story right?<br> <br>Anyway, this is the impression of SICP. It's very<br>wordy.

<p>Without naming the paper, that's the thought that came to me a few days ago as I was reading a PhD thesis.  While I was pleased that the author did not (generally) resort to big words for simple concepts, I did note that he spent an awfully long amount of time justifying his approach to his thesis.  After thinking about it, I came to the conclusion that I could reduce the first 20 pages of his thesis down to a page or two.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I've never written such a beast, so I suppose there are probably rules that I don't know about.</p>
