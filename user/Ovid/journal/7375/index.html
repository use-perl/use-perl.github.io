<p><p>So, our creative director rushed out of his office today yelling "Who knows what a JBF file is?"  Regrettably, he didn't care for my answer.</p>

<p><em>Note:  if you're not familiar with the JBF acronym, you're probably better off.</em></p>

<p>Interesting to note that Microsoft has <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/08/18/1519217&mode=thread&tid=109">withdrawn support for their free Web fonts</a>.  Since ugly fonts seems to be one of the most common complaints about Linux, I assume that this is an attempt to make life a little more difficult for Linux users.  Coincidentally, this was the day that I finally got around to upgrading the fonts on my system.</p>

<p>Personally, as a programmer, I love using Linux as my primary box.  In fact, with the exception of needing to grab a file off my Windows box, I haven't turned it on since I started using Linux.  Still, Linux is a pain.  I've had two Linux "gurus" over to my place who both failed to get KPPP working.  I have to use NEAT to connect to the 'net and I periodically have to reboot the box when NEAT fails to connect.  I assume that I probably need to send an ATZ command to the modem, but I don't even know how to do that :(</p>

<p>Yup, still a newbie with Linux, but I'm going to stick with it.  In the meantime, I feel Windows has Linux trounced in terms of "ease of use".</p>

<p>And if someone whispers OS-X, I'll whisper back "but I like building my own box".</p></p>

In at least one reality,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.jbf is a PaintShop Pro (PSP) browser cache file. PSP is a reasonable, albeit scaled-down, alternative to Photoshop if you don't want to fork over the big bucks.<br> <br>Though I'm kind of curious what you said.<br> <br>

<p>Er, um, uh<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... jbf, in some circles, frequently refers to hair, as in "just been f*****d hair".</p>

There's a joke in there somewhere about a bulldog and mayonnaise, but we'd best let that one pass.<br>

<h2>Linux</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/shockme/">shockme</a> on 2002-08-29T03:34:17</h3>
What Linux distro are you running?

<p>Red Hat 7.3 which, by the way, I was relieved to discover, now has Perl 5.6.1 standard instead of the 5.6.0 distro that they included for the longest time.  Never could figure out why they left in a known buggy version of Perl.</p>

<p>Oh, and every set of instructions I've found to get my wheel mouse running has failed, failed, failed.  At least on Windows, it just <em>works</em>.  I think most who know me are pretty clear that I am not a Microsoft fan (often great products, usually a Bad Company) but their desktop is sharp.</p>

<p>Side note:  when I first started working at my current job, the owner of the company -- who I barely knew -- saw my Windows box with a theme manager on it and asked what the heck it was.  I said "oh, I got rid of Windows and installed Linux".</p>

<p>He just shrugged and replied "whatever makes you productive".  I'm kicking myself now because I <em>could</em> have installed Linux and the programmers would have it now.  Currently, we all work on Windows boxes with Cygwin or, if we really need control, using Putty to connect to a Linux box.  The owner is no longer interested in letting us use Linux desktops and is afraid that if we switch to Linux at work, our email won't work as well, we won't be able to exchange spreadsheets, etc.  Bummer.</p>

Wow, that's a bummer about the owner's attitude.  I guess I'm fortunate, in that one of the first questions my boss asked me on my first day at work was "Which distribution of Linux do you want to run?"  Actually, everyone in the Systems group is now running Linux, either as their primary OS or through VMWare.
<p>
That's odd that the wheelmouse isn't working.  I'm running Mandrake 8.2, and IIRC, had to make the following change to my<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/etc/X11/XF86Config-4 file:
</p><p><blockquote><div>
Section "InputDevice"<br>

    Identifier  "Mouse1"<br>
    Driver      "mouse"<br>
    Option "Protocol"    "IMPS/2"<br>
    Option "Device"      "/dev/mouse"<br>
    Option "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"<br>
</div></blockquote>
<p>
After that, no problems.  I think I may have had to make the same change on RH7.2.</p>
