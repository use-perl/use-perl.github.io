<p><p>I just picked up MJD's book.  I've been dying to check it out, but when I discovered a chapter on declarative programming, I thought I could die of happiness.  This confirms that I am, in fact, a dork.</p></p>

Quantum didn't have any in stock, but said they'd order one for me.<br> <br>I'm disappointed that I needed to order it.  I know bricks&amp;mortar stores can't stock everything, but this is the biggest Perl title this year, isn't it?<br> <br>I like to buy a healthy fraction of my tech books from Quantum or SoftPro, because I want to still have tech bookstores to browse in.  But they're only useful for browsing if they stock deeply.<br>

<p>Actually, I was concerned that Powell's Tech might not have any in stock.  Their Web site listed two, but I couldn't find them.  Schwern wandered over and how it was going and I mentioned that I couldn't find "Higher Order Perl" and the guy next to me said "hey, that's the book I'm looking for, too!"</p>

<p>As it turns out, they did have two copies, but they hadn't shelved them yet.  I was worried that the other guy and I would have to arm wrestle, but maybe I could have talked Schwern into sucker punching him or something.  Fortunately, two copies were on hand and violence was avoided.</p>

<p>Go to Powell's Tech, demand your copy and when they see demand way up, they'll feature the book front and center.</p>

Heh.  I noticed that the Powell's website listed <i>one</i> copy on Saturday.  It's now safely in my possession.  Nyah.
