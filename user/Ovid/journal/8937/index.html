<p><p>... I'd have no luck at all.  Well, with meeting a potential partner, that is.  Life is good, but I think the <a href="/user/Ovid/journal/8368">Money Gods</a> have been hanging out with the Relationship Gods and said "hey, lets go mess with this Ovid guy."</p>

<p>As mentioned in <a href="/user/Ovid/journal/8907">yesterday's journal</a>, I asked someone out on a date (10 times, by accident) and she accepted.  After accepting, she made some comments in a follow-up email that suggested that she might have a boyfriend.  Uh oh.  She shows up and we head to a restaurant down the street and she asks if she can invite a friend who lives very close to me.  Um, okay.</p>

<p>We walk to her friend's house and out steps this incredibly beautiful woman.  The lady I asked out was attractive, but this one was ... wow!  I found myself walking to the restaurant with them wondering how I managed to wind up in the company of two attractive, friendly women, at least one of whom was interested in <em>me</em>.</p>

<p>Naturally, appearances were deceiving.  After a bit of conversation, I came to the conclusion that the second woman was either incredibly stoned or heavily medicated.  Scratch one name.  As for the first?  It turns out that she doesn't have a boyfriend.  She has a husband.</p>

<p>After having met through some friends and two weeks of swapping email she can't be bothered to mention such an important detail?  Scratch two names.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>  I'm idly wondering if someone's going to rebuke me with the <a href="http://www.nmt.edu/user/val/howto.html">HOWTO encourage women in linux</a> link.  I don't think the above post qualifies as being <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=sexist">sexist</a>, but I realize that some automatically feel that <em>any</em> discussion of this subject matter qualifies.</p></p>
