<p><p>Today I got fed up and started removing all reference to television seasons from our code base.  What's a season?  We don't know either.  But they're deprecated and they were getting in the way of some code I was working on.  In the process, I had to delete a test fixture which created a season.  This forced me to rewrite one of my tests.  A test I had written just a few days ago to alter a feature that was, apparently, untested.</p>

<p>I switched the test to a different fixture and was amazed that all tests passed!  Then I looked at the test.</p>

<pre>my $expected_xml = $mech->content;

my $xml = $mech->content;
is $xml, $expected_xml, '... and the schedule should return the correct xml';</pre>

<p>Um, excuse me?  Not only did I write this and check it in, but no one noticed.  I clearly need to stop doing drugs at work.</p>

<p>Speaking of drugs, a few years ago, the very right-wing Republican Bush-loving owner of a company I shall not name got mad at me.  He came up to my desk and said "I can't believe you did that!  Should I send you down for a drug test?"</p>

<p>I turned to him and calmly replied, "That would be a bad idea.  If you test me, you should test everyone.  I'll probably be the only person who passes that test.  And I happen to know for a fact that this includes you."</p>

<p>He stared at me.  Sipped his coffee.  Stared some more and then quietly turned around and walked away.</p></p>

<h2>What's a season?</h2>

It's whatever the show's creators define it to be, isn't it? It's somewhat arbitrary (though typically September to May for most TV shows in the US), but it definitely exists, even for shows with large gaps in the middle, such as Battlestar Galactica.
<p>
Or am I missing something?</p>

<p>We call that a "series" instead of a season.  What in the US would be called a "series" we call a "brand".  So "Battlestar Galactica" is the brand and its second year's episodes are shown in the second "series".  I still don't know what a season is supposed to be.</p>

<p>Apparently a season is a group of broadcasts that are to be editorially grouped according to some common criteria.  So if a music show spends a month covering punk music, that might be the "punk season".  However, it was never terribly clear and the editorial side apparently had difficult agreeing on everything, so it never got implemented.</p>

<p>Also, not only do you need to stop doing drugs, your coworkers apparently also need to quit their tranquillisers.</p>
