<div class="span8">
<p><p>My article on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Class/">Test::Class</a> has been published on <a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/">modernperlbooks.com</a>.  It's broken down into bite-sized chunks as:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/03/organizing-test-suites-with-testclass.html">Organizing Test Suites with Test::Class</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/03/reusing-test-code-with-testclass.html">Reusing Test Code with Test::Class</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/03/making-your-testing-life-easier.html">Making Your Testing Life Easier</a> (refactoring and other tricks)</li>
</ol>

<p>For German speakers, it's also due to be published in May (I think) in <a href="http://www.perl-magazin.de/">$foo Perl Magazin</a>.</p>

<p>One note about the article:  I first wrote that a few years ago and never got around to submitting it.  Clearly, since the article uses <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Moose/">Moose</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Most/">Test::Most</a>, I've updated it quite heavily.  One update I <em>forgot</em> is that the <tt>Test::</tt> namespace prefix should be clarified. It should be something like <tt>Tests:</tt>, <tt>My::Test:</tt> or <tt>Test::${company_name}::</tt> or basically anything which avoids conflicts with the <tt>Test::</tt> namespace.</p>

<p>So far comments have been nice and Piers Cawley <a href="http://www.bofh.org.uk/2009/03/11/writing-parsers-for-fun-and-convenience">mentions it in his blog and also seems quite happy with it</a> (that's an awesome blog post, by the way.  It's an attempt to bring <tt>Devel::Declare</tt> magic to <tt>Test::Class</tt>).</p>

<p>One thing which didn't survive chromatic's editing was my "Tip Summary" at the end of the three parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Name your test classes consistently after the classes they're testing.</li>
  <li>When possible, do the same for your test methods.</li>
  <li>Don't use a constructor test named <tt>new</tt>.</li>
  <li>Create your own <tt>Test::Class</tt> base class.</li>
  <li>Abstract the the name of the class you're testing into a <tt>class</tt> method in your base class (possibly the most important tip).</li>
  <li>Name test control methods after their attribute.</li>
  <li>Decide case-by-case whether to call a control method's parent method.</li>
  <li>Don't put tests in your test control methods.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of those might sounds odd, but if you read the articles, I explain what's going on.</p></p>

<h2>Thanks!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Asim/">Asim</a> on 2009-03-13T11:49:32</h3>
Your articles helped me sort out TDD w/Moose, an issue I had worked on a couple of weeks ago. Very timely, and effective.



<h2>Good article!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2009-03-13T12:43:00</h3>
<p>Cleared up a bit for me.</p>



<h2>Great Resource</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jk2addict/">jk2addict</a> on 2009-03-13T13:12:31</h3>
<p>I've been away from Perl for a while, so this is a great resource for me to get back into testing using Test::Class and not falling back to my old<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.t ways.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>



<h2>Test::Able</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/zby/">zby</a> on 2009-03-13T14:37:27</h3>
And reading comments under Pierses blog I found Test::Able - which boastes to be Moose based Test::Class.

<p>Yeah, I was looking at that (saw in the same blog entry).  Looks very cool and, because it uses a MOP, promises to make easy some things which are hard in Test::Class.</p>
