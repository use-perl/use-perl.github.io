<div class="span8">
<p><p>I really enjoyed hacking with <a href="http://www.pugscode.org/">Pugs</a>, but after a while, there were some Haskell extensions that were required which broke my installation and I never got around to upgrading it.  Then the minimum version of Haskell was incremented and I kept telling myself "I would get back to it".  Yesterday I decided this was important to do.  Why?</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you haven't been following Patrick Michaud's excellent work with PGE, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_thread/thread/70baaae220bf4a97/28d4e184e0e4efa2#28d4e184e0e4efa2">you won't believe what you're missing</a>.</li>
  <li>The current issue of <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com/">The Perl Review</a> has a article by Alberto Manuel SimÃÂµes entitled "Programming Parrot".</li>
  <li>Playing with Pugs was just, well, fun!</li>
</ul>

<p>So yesterday I updated Parrot and Haskell and built the latest version of Pugs.  The tests started at <tt>Sat May 20 17:08:35 PDT 2006</tt>.  They ended at <tt>Sat May 20 21:42:49 PDT 2006</tt>.  With over 9000 tests, each test is taking an average of over 30 seconds to run on my laptop.</p></p>

For me, make ran for 5 1/2 hours, and make test ran for just under 5 1/4 hours.  This is still dramatically better than it used to be -- I saw 11 hour make test times before the recent speedup.  (The make is thrash-limited on my 1/4GB desktop, as ghc grows to about 310 MB, all apparently active in the largest compile.  This doesn't apply to make test, though, as pugs, once built, stays a much more manageable size.)
