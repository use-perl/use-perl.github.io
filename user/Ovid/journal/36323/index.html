<p><p>You know, I would really like to be able to hide outer scopes in Perl.  There are plenty of times that I've worked with bad code and I would love to quickly and easily see what variables are embedded in a chunk of code which are defined in another scope.  I figured out one way to do this with a primitive refactoring tool I'm working on.  I shove the code into a different namespace, wrap it in a subroutine to prevent it from being executed (the code will <tt>croak()</tt> if there is a BEGIN block), and then <tt>eval</tt> it with strict and warnings.  The error messages are trivial to parse and I can figure out which variables are not defined there.</p>

<p>This leads to my next problem:  which variables <em>are</em> defined after that chunk of code which are dependent on that chunk of code.  Trying to figure out the "extract method" refactoring means I have nastiness like this:</p>

<pre>my ( $foo, $bar );
($foo, $bar, $baz ) = $self->_extracted_method($baz);</pre>

<p>That raises another issue.  The code must now <em>always</em> work in list context (let's hope you don't have <tt>wantarray</tt> embedded in the extracted code) and if there is an embedded return (some languages only allow return at the end of a method/subroutine), then this could also screw things up.</p>

<p>The more I play with this, the more I understand why Adam Kennedy struggled with a refactoring editor.</p>

<p>However, if I go for an 80% solution and I write tests (which, as you know, I do), then I could execute a refactoring and then <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Ovid/journal/36280">automatically run all tests for the refactored code</a>.</p></p>
