If you noticed my last post about the Supreme Court decision that it's not unconstitutional to put an innocent man to death, then you'll see where I was going with that.</p>

<p>I have to say that I was not as happy as I could be with that piece.  There's too much to say, too little time to say it (even if I did a multi-part piece) and my second paragraph is just atrocious.  I've also noticed that when I write these political pieces, much of the humor that I interject into my Perl writing is absent.  I wonder why that is?</p></p>

<h2>Lack of Humor</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2004-01-27T18:48:45</h3>
<p>You may just be an angry, angry man.  Have you tried squealing on stage?</p>



<h2>no humor?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidboyd/">jdavidboyd</a> on 2004-01-28T17:18:26</h3>
Because there is nothing remotely funny in the topic.  It is all too too sad.



<h2>Comfort</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2004-02-04T00:18:25</h3>
My guess is you're not yet comfortable enough with it.  You are trying so hard to make the points, it leaves no room for humor.  Don't try to force it (I don't think you will anyway), just focus on trying to loosen up a little while you're making your point, if you catch my drift.

Yeah, I think you're right.  I haven't found my voice and I definitely come across more stridently than I mean to.  It's a great exercise as it's teaching me a lot about writing, particularly that I don't write nearly as well as I would like.  If I can't find my voice, I'm going to have trouble turning this into a sideline.

<em>If I can't find my voice, I'm going to have trouble turning this into a sideline.</em> <br> <br>It'll come.  It takes practice, introspection.  Read irreverent political columns from others, like in National Review and The Nation (hit both sides of the fence there<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).
