<p><p>As some of you may know, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/graphics.html">the new Macbook Pro has two graphics processors</a>.  One of them is lower specced, but your battery lasts longer.  I really like the higher specced one.  We'll get back to that.</p>

<p>When my laptop recently started crashing, having plenty of graphic glitches and generally being annoying (not always while hot, I might add), I went to have it serviced.  I wound up spending an extra $77 for "Pro Care" to ensure my box would be looked at overnight.  Otherwise, it could take 10 to 14 days to be fixed.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after not having been contacted in over 48 hours, I called them.  Seems I bought "pro care" <em>after</em> they registered the repair, thus not listing me as a pro care customer.  They fixed that and I got a call this morning.  Seems there's not much wrong with my box except that I should be using the Nvidia 9400M graphics card (the lower specced one) instead of Nvidia 9600M GT.  Seems the latter has known software issues.  They're working on a fix, but there's no word when it will be out.  So one of the best features of this laptop -- one that Apple brags about and one of the reasons I bought it -- is disabled for an indefinite amount of time.</p>

<p>Thank goodness it's not the <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/921/1049921/inquirer-confirms-apple-macbook-pros-have-nvidia-bad-bump-material">Macbook Pro bad bump problem that Nvidia allegedly tried to cover up</a>.</p></p>
