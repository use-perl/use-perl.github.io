<div class="span8">
<p><p>I'm sure most of you are familiar with the debates which have consumed the Perl community lately.  I really don't want to get into that other than to say that supporters on all sides have valid reasons for their views and <em>everyone</em> has something to contribute.  Rather than speculate on what some problems are -- oh, and believe me, I can! -- I think what's more important is to figure out how to obtain information relevant to these considerations.  In fact, I have several "perceptions" I think need to be better understood.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Perl is dead.</li>
  <li>We need to eliminate Perl from our company.</li>
  <li>Perl's OK, but I wouldn't choose it for a startup.</li>
  <li>I want to learn a new language, but not Perl.</li>
  <li>Perl is unmaintainable.</li>
  <li>Perl doesn't scale (I'd love to see their jaws drop if they saw some projects I've worked on).</li>
</ol>

<p>How did these perceptions arise?  What is the source of them? Are people merely parroting what they've heard or do they have first-hand experience?  What would it take to change people's minds?</p>

<p>These perceptions are a few things I hear constantly from those <em>outside</em> of Perl.  Inside of Perl, we have different perceptions, but outside of Perl, I hear wildly different stories.  Many of those stories don't match my experiences (see item #6 above), but in order to understand where the perception problem is coming from, it would be useful to better understand why people have these ideas (rather than play "pin the tail on the scape goat").</p>

<p>What I am thinking would be useful is for someone with some expertise in creating surveys to figure out a way to start collecting this information.  So when I created the <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=701817">testing survey</a>, there was a lot of fascinating information, but given my lack of expertise in creating surveys, it was rather limited (<tt>brian d foy</tt> helped quite a bit in expanding that survey beyond my initial questions).</p>

<p>I'm very keen on understanding the perceptions that programmers and organizations have about Perl.  If we identify strong, persistent currents in thought, that might give us a clue as to what a good way forward would be.  A lot of people are making blanket assertions about what Perl needs for the future.  Some are quite reasonable (how do we tighten up the P5P development process), but many are based on hunches (Perl definitely needs to do X!!!).</p>

<p>Anyone interested in picking up this gauntlet and trying to better understand what we need to do?  (This would involve potentially surveying companies in addition to individuals).</p></p>

<p>I think unless someone (TPF?) hires a professional research firm, any "survey" about this is going to have limited value.  To get at not just *what* the perceptions are but *why*, I think you'll need a properly designed survey and true random sampling of IT professionals.</p><p>-- dagolden</p>

<h2>Ask someone on the outside of Perl</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rozallin/">rozallin</a> on 2009-07-24T18:26:44</h3>
<p>I have some experience of designing and administering questionnaires and analysing questionnaire data, both from my academic studies and in my current and previous jobs, and this is why I agree with dagolden that we need to enlist the services of a PR firm specialising in reputation analysis. I seem to recall seeing a talk at a London.pm workshop/tech meeting about how a company[1] was using Perl/NLP techniques to do just that for major corporate brands, but purely on a statistical level like brandwatch.net does. Since our question is not just <i>what</i> people think but also <i>why</i>, I think we'd also need to conduct field research at universities, tech conferences/meetings and at companies across several countries, so I can't imagine this research would be quick or cheap.</p><p>That said if this isn't possible, and the majority of the community is willing to accept the caveats and problems with an enthusiastic, amateur approach, I'm willing to help out.</p><p>[1] I can't for the life of me remember its name and I've looked through the schedules to no avail.</p>

<h2>Perception is Reality</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gabor/">gabor</a> on 2009-07-25T06:45:25</h3>
While I agree with the need to change the perception of people from the outside I doubt
you can actually find out why do they have that perception. As the saying goes <b>perception is reality</b> so how do you ask people why do they think reality is what it is?
<p>
I don't think companies invest in finding out <b>why</b> is their perception bad. They invest in <b>changing it</b>.
</p><p>
I think Perl needs someone with a marketing hat. Someone who has this as a paid job. One of the first things she should do is to find out <b>what is</b> really the perception of people from the outside and how to <b>change it</b>?
</p><p>
AFAIK the TPF grant of Richard Dice does not cover this but I hope we will be able to hire and finance someone who can do this.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2009-07-25T18:14:43</h3>
<p>Steve Yegge covered these points at OSCon a few years back.
</p><p>
The root problem is that geeks don't do marketing well, don't respect marketing, even when marketing is the most important thing we can do for ourselves and our projects.  (It's been a while since I listened to his talk, so my memory is fuzzy here.)
</p><p>
One of the interesting points he made is that GTE (the phone company) had a very bad reputation among its customers and in its service area.  They conducted a poll to see what it would take to improve their reputation and brand perception, how long it would take, and how much it would cost.  As Steve tells it, if GTE had absolutely stellar performance from this day forward until the end of time, and an unlimited marketing budget to improve perception of the brand, it would take 25 years (or about a generation) to lose its bad brand perception.
</p><p>
So they chose to take a different path: change the name of the company to Verizon, something that had no embedded brand perception to work against.
</p><p>
"Perl" now has 20+ years of compounded bad perception in the parts of the tech community that cares about it. "Perl 6" has had about half as much time being badly received by the same group.  If there were an infinite budget for marketing campaigns and PR surveys, those opinions won't change easily.

<p>I find this really interesting.  If Perl's PR is so bad that we can't pull out of it, then I guess always referring to Perl 6 as Rakudo (assuming that's the implementation you use) could be a great thing.</p><p>That being said, I'm not a defeatist and I don't believe Perl's PR problems are insurmountable.  The Perl community's resistance to PR, however, might be, thus making this a moot point.</p>

We will never agree on a term.</p><p>However, I think we can both agree that marketing activities should reflect reality.  That's why I base my conclusions on (and refer to) publicly accessible raw data, such as timelines, release dates, bug reports, patch submissions, commit logs, documentation, and mailing lists are all public information.  Anyone who wants to review that data in its original context can do so.</p>

<p>You systematically misrepresent the problems that the Perl 5 development has, and invent new ones. You propose technical solutions that show a total lack of understanding of what is a large user base for Perl 5. You refuse to listen to people who actually work on Perl 5. You arrogantly think that if most people on P5P think you're wrong, that's because most of P5P is wrong. Perl needs PR, but _your_ kind of PR is certainly hurting Perl a lot.</p>

<p>As Dave Mitchell <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2009-07/msg01018.html" title="mpe.mpg.de">said on P5P</a mpe.mpg.de>, a list of hasty notes taken during a discussion among a non-representative group of mostly irregular porters was bound to ignore the most important problems. Yet I effectively recognize many concerns which I already mentioned (see for example the end of <a href="http://consttype.blogspot.com/2009/07/job-of-pumpking.html" title="blogspot.com">http://consttype.blogspot.com/2009/07/job-of-pumpking.html</a blogspot.com> ) and I largely agree with the general line of thought. Which has little in common with yours, as explained on modernperlbooks. The BOF discussed about release management and volunteer herding; they didn't propose to break backwards compatibility, or introduce syntactic sugar without semantics for its pure fashionable value; nor did they invent imaginary problems.</p><p>I note that you completely failed to address the <a href="http://consttype.blogspot.com/2009/07/resigning.html" title="blogspot.com">numerous flaws</a blogspot.com> I pointed in your reasoning. Yet you continue to stick to your position. Don't misquote me: I didn't called you a marketer. What you're doing not real marketing, this is using marketing slogans to help oneself ignoring the reality, and that's what I said.</p><p>You're turning into a Dilbert character -- how is it possible to continue taking you seriously now ?</p>

I'm nobody.  Just an old (49) programmer who has spent more time using Java than Perl, but who wishes it were the reverse.  Perl has nearly been removed as a development language where I work.  That's sad, because Perl is exciting and interesting.  I'm looking forward to creating new things using Perl 6 and I'm excited by the changes to Perl 5.  I do work on some DarkPAN code.  I'd like to move beyond Third Edition Camel and first edition cookbook when I do so.  I've found chromatic's writing helpful for that.  I've never posted anything on CPAN, or patched Perl.  I just try to read alot about it.  So I guess I'm not allowed to comment on the Perl development process at all.<br>
<br>
I have been watching this debate.  Rafael, when you make an argument for your position it is generally well reasoned and well supported.  But when you write about chromatic's arguments you spout ridiculous hyperbole like this, "give you the right to pour garbage continuously on P5P".  That doesn't match reality from where I sit at all.  Neither did anything else you wrote above.  Is there somewhere other than <a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/index.html" title="modernperlbooks.com">Modern Perl Books</a modernperlbooks.com>, <a href="http://planet.perl.org/" title="perl.org">Planet Perl</a perl.org>, <a href="http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/" title="enlightenedperl.org">Planet Perl Iron Man</a enlightenedperl.org> and <a href="http://use.perl.org/" title="perl.org">Use Perl</a perl.org> where chromatic has written this disinformation and FUD?  Strong arguments about release schedules and deprecation are not disinformation and FUD.<br>
<br>
You know, I never heard of you until recently, because I mainly learned about Perl through <a href="http://perl.com/" title="perl.com">Perl.com</a perl.com>.  But I did know chromatic from all his good work there.  (Not to bring up old wounds.)  I think it odd that you think you have the right to mischaracterize his efforts for Perl as miniscule, just because yours are herculean.  My efforts for Perl are miniscule.  His?  Not so much.<br>
<br>
Luckily, having spent lots of time arguing on the internet, I am very well qualified to critique the way you argue, if not how you develop software.<br>
