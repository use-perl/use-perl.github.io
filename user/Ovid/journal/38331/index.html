<h1>Nope, This Microsoft Interview Is Not Satire</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>I had to double-check that I wasn't on the Onion or BBSpot (seriously!) because <a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/245859/qa-microsoft-defends-return-to-drm.html">this interview with the UK head of Microsoft's mobile division, explaining their new mobile music service</a> is, well, jaw-dropping.  Let me summarize the new features offered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They cost more than their competitors</li>
  <li>They offer nothing their competitors don't</li>
  <li>They've embraced DRM, meaning that unlike many competitors, once your mobile is gone, so is your music.</li>
</ul>

<p>They even admit in the interview that they don't have the technology to transfer music from the phone to the PC.  Excuse me?  This can't be right.  This is ... just ... jaw-droppingly stupid.  I know Microsoft has done some incredibly idiotic things in the past, but they're not even <em>trying</em> to swing at the ball here.  I'm dumbfounded.</p>

<p>In short, MS is following a unique strategy of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Offering you nothing</li>
  <li>Admitting that they're offering you nothing</li>
</ol>

<p>What the hell?</p></p>

<p>When has not having an actual product ever stopped many a company or Microsoft in particular in the past? Does anyone believe anything companies say? Good, bad or indifferent? What is Windows 7 but Vista SP2, yet people are lining up to sing it's praises and it's not even been released yet...</p>
