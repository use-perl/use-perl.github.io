<p><p>Just a gentle reminder to folks:  you can email me about my CPAN modules as much as you want.  I don't mind.  There is, however, an excellent chance that you'll never get a reply.  I mean to reply, but I forget, get distracted, whatever.  If it's a question about a module or general discussion, that's OK.  I might remember to answer.  I might not.  However, if it's a bug or feature request, please put those things in the RT queue for the CPAN module and even though there's just as great a chance that I'll forget, at least RT won't forget and I'll have a better chance of seeing it later.  More importantly, someone else has a better chance of seeing it later.</p>

<P>I have several bugs that I've cleaned up on RT because I was going through and paying attention to them.  That doesn't happen with email.</p>

<p>PS:  And please don't tell me to organize my email better.  I already have <em>tons</em> of organization in my email, but most of us already know the old saw about too many levels of abstraction.  Same thing.  I'm just not an email guy.</p></p>

<h2>Bounce</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/awwaiid/">awwaiid</a> on 2008-05-19T12:55:18</h3>
I often use the 'bounce' feature of mutt to re-send an email to an RT queue at work. Keeps me from forgetting and, because our RT system sends a ticket-received response back to the user, it helps them see that I prefer RT to Track Requests.
