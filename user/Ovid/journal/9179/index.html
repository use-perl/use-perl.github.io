<p><p>We have the next migration of $customer's Web site today.  Hopefully, we'll get down to two-week iterations now.  I think the one week iterations are a bit too tight, and three week iterations would be too long, but the two week porridge is just right.</p>

<p>One of my major goals in the last release was to eliminate all spurious warnings in the error log.  Previously, we were generating error logs that were literally tens of thousands of lines long with "unitiliazed value" warnings or other silly little things.  The error log cried wolf so often that we never looked at it until there was a problem and then it took a long time to wade through.  So I just grabbed the log from the site and skimmed through it.  After five days, it's 300 lines long.  Virtually every line is the same error -- and it's an honest-to-goodness bug that we really needed to know about.</p>

<p>In other news, I discovered a major weakness in my tests:  I created a special user in the database (app user, not database user) to run my tests on.  Naturally, in the cleanup for the migration, that user was deleted and the tests started failing.  I need to take the time to have my tests write the data to the database and clean up after themselves rather than relying on information that might or might not be there.  Foolish me.</p></p>
