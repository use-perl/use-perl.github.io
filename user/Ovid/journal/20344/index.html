<p><p>If you don't mind pair programming, test-driven development, Mason, Perl, no overtime and your choice of OS to develop on, you might want to send your resume to my boss:  Timothy Grant, tjg at rentrak dot com.  (I don't have 'em sent to me anymore since I got tired of forwarding them on.)</p>

<p>We actually don't care if you know Perl or Mason. We care about whether or not you are a good programmer (or have solid potential). You can learn Perl and Mason on the job. Internationalization experience is a bonus, but not required.  Check out our Web site to get an idea of who we are.</p>

<p>We're located in beautiful Portland, Oregon (near the airport, if that means anything to you).</p>

<p>On a personal note: I've worked for a number of companies and this is one of the best working environments I've enjoyed.</p></p>

<h2>Salary range?</h2>

Would happen to know the range?

<p>I don't make that decision, sorry.  I know it's aggravating.  When I go job hunting, I'm always going to first look at the companies who list a range<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:/</p>

I've been doing Mason programming for about... jeeze, 5 years now.<br> <br>Even went on the first Perl Whirl mainly to see Reuven Lerner give a two day seminar on it. (OK, the Alaskan cruise was nice too<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-))<br> <br>But, at eight hours driving time... I think the commute would be a killer. (I live in North Idaho about 30 minutes east of Spokane)<br> <br><nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
