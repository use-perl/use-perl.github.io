<p><p>As a programmer, it's pretty much a given that I sit at a computer all day.  This is not condusive to good physical health.  So I started running.  In February, I couldn't run 3 blocks without being on the verge of collapse.  Pitiful.</p>

<p>Now I'm up to three miles a day and I've decided to start training for the Portland Marathon.  Wish me luck (or a return to sanity).  I'm tracking my progress on my <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/publius_ovidius/">personal journal</a>.</p>

<p>In other news, my recently purchased Laphroaig 15-year is also probably not going to do much for my health, but it's damned good.  Yum.  (And can anyone spell Laphroaig without looking it up?  I certainly can't.)</p></p>

...mmm <a href="http://www.laphroaig.com/" title="laphroaig.com">Laphroaig</a laphroaig.com>. The spelling is easy (especially when it's right in front of you), but how is it pronounced? My goal is to someday visit Islay and <a href="http://www.scotlandwhisky.com/distilleries/islay/Laphroaig" title="scotlandwhisky.com">collect  the rent on my square foot.</a scotlandwhisky.com>

<p>It's pronounced <em>la-froyg</em>.  I have a friend who went there and got a certificate for a small plot of land.  I had heard that this was actually part of a legal ploy ensuring that the government can never  take the land as there would be too many people they'd have to settle with.  Interesting thought.  Wonder if it's true (though I suspect not).</p>

<p>I have fond memories of drinking "Sheep Dip" in Glen Coe, and was told that that particular whisky got it's name so that farmers, vets, etc. could buy it and write it off as a business expense<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
<p>Another version is that whisky was at one time illegal, so the code word was that you were going to get some "Sheep Dip".</p>

I used run 3 miles a day... Now (only 3 years later) I  can barely run 1 =(<br><br/><br/>Every time I try to get back into jogging I only last for a week at the most.<br> <br><br/><br/>Good luck and keep pounding that pavement!
