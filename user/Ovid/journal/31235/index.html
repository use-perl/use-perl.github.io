<div class="span8">
<p><P>For a command line program, we needed objects of different classes to show up in a special "select" list we had created, where the users could choose some, all, or none of the objects lists.  I wanted to reuse the code, but the current strategy of wrapping objects in hashes to preserve extra state information (e.g., whether or not they were selected) was rather clunky.  Instead, I wrote a small trait and applied it to the respective classes at runtime:</p>

<pre>package Trait::Selected;

use strict;
use warnings;

use Class::Trait 'base';
use Scalar::Util 'refaddr';

my %is_selected;

sub is_selected {
    my $self = shift;
    my $id   = refaddr $self;
    $is_selected{$id} ||= 0;
    return $is_selected{$id} unless @_;
    $is_selected{$id} = shift;
    return $self;
}

1;</pre>

<p>And if you want a class to have a 'selected' method, you just do this:</p>

<pre>Class::Trait->apply( $some_class => 'Trait::Selected' );</pre>

<p>Heck, if you don't like altering your entire class, you can just do it on a 'per instance' basis:</p>

<pre>Class::Trait->apply( $some_instance => 'Trait::Selected' );</pre>

<p>Then, only that instance gets the method and others don't (similar to prototyped OO).</p>

<p>One of the many cleanups this allowed was this:</p>

<pre>@servers = map { $_->{selected} ? $_->{obj} : () } @servers;</pre>

<p>To this:</p>

<pre>@servers = grep { $_->is_selected } @servers;</pre>

<p>Needless to say, the second is far easier to read.</p>

<p>But you can probably see where this is heading.  What happens when an object falls out of scope and another one reuses that address?  To deal with this, I have to instantiate objects like this:</p>

<pre>my $object = $some_class->new(@args)->is_selected(0);</pre>

<p>Any trait which is applied at runtime and maintains state could have similar issues.  The only way I can think of dealing with this is to try and hook into the <tt>DESTROY</tt> mechanism, if present.  Ugh.</p></p>

I had similiar ugly destruction issues when I tried to add runtime roles to Moose. In my case the actual anon-class packages were getting cleaned up (which happened when the anon-class metaclass instance went out of scope and it's DESTORY was called). It was ugly I tell you, ugly.

<p>You know, that's a typo which might inadvertently be more descriptive than the original<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Whoops, I do that one all time too. My fingers do it, and my brain reads it as DESTROY and then I go bug hunting for hours until I finally realize and then smack myself for it. *sigh* maybe I should just switch to Java, finalize is much harder to mispell<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:P
