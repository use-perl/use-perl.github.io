That's not a bad answer, except for the "our specs are always wrong" dig, which may be true, but saying so in that context is kind of like pissing into a fan. It implies that you can <i>never</i> give estimates.
<p>
The option between no estimate and "Tuesday, March 3rd at 3:47pm" is to give a confidence range. "Based on what we know, it's probably going to take 4 people between 2 and 6 months. To give you a better estimate, I would need to know X, Y, and Z, and you need to decide P and Q" gives management something to work with, and it pushes some responsibility back onto them.

<h2>Yes, But</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2003-02-11T19:33:47</h3>
<p>
"I can't give you a <em>useful</em> estimate" may be more accurate.  The more you know about a project, including your previous experience with it, the better your estimates will be.  As long as everyone realizes that there's a feedback loop there, you'll be better off.
</p>



<h2>Bridge to nowhere</h2>

<p>Ah yes, "Build an interface between null and void".  I get this sort of request surprisingly often.</p>
<p>As the others are noting, you can always provide an estimate, but you need to qualify the level of confidence.  "As things stand, I think it'll take X people Y weeks, and I'm 10% confident of my answer.  When they get system P built to the point where I can see the data and test the interface, I can give you estimates with 90% confidence."  Or some such.</p>

A co-worker sometimes pulls out this quote he attributes to a former manager:<br/><br/>"You go ahead and get started coding and I will find out what they want."
