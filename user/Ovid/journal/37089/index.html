<p><P>The <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=3029">patch</a> I accepted for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Differences/">Test::Differences</a> which allows one to compare string/numeric values in hashrefs has a very, very nasty bug.  This now passes:</p>

<pre>use Test::More 'no_plan';
use Test::Differences;
diag $Test::Differences::VERSION;

eq_or_diff   { foo => 1 },   { foo => 1 }, 'oops!';
eq_or_diff [ { foo => 1 } ], { foo => 1 }, 'oops!';</pre>

<p>Sigh.  Good thing this is a development version.</p>

<p>If anyone cares to take a gander at it, I'd be grateful.  I'm back to work and may not get to this right away.  I'm thinking about forcing it to use <tt>&amp;Test::More::is_deeply</tt> for the actual test and only do the diff if that fails.  That might change how some things look in test results, but should tremendously simplify the internals.</p></p>

<h2>sorry</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/markjugg/">markjugg</a> on 2008-08-04T13:10:05</h3>
<p>Sorry about the flawed patch.</p><p>When I saw it the other day, it didn't look familiar, and then I noticed that I submitted it about 4 years ago.</p>

<p>Heh.  No worries.  It's not obvious that it's flawed and frankly, if it weren't for a typo in my test suite, I never would have noticed. I'd be astonished if you recalled code from four years ago<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Besides, I'm just damned grateful that there's a patch in the first place.</p><p>And I don't see what's wrong, either (but IIRC, _flatten() is returning an aref without an embedded hashref for the AoH, but I'm not sure and don't have time to fix this today. As a result, we've downgraded.)</p>

<h2>I don't think this is a new bug...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mauzo/">mauzo</a> on 2008-08-04T15:32:36</h3>
(but possibly I'm misunderstanding a limitation of T::D). With 0.47, for instance, I get<blockquote><div><p> <tt>&nbsp; perl -MTest::More=tests,1 -MTest::Differences<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -e'eq_or_diff [a =&gt; 1], [{a =&gt; 1}], "oops"'<br>&nbsp; 1..1<br>&nbsp; ok 1 - oops</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>which is just as wrong. It happens because _flatten treats hashes as equivalent to arrays, and an array of one element as equivalent to a scalar.</p>

<p>Hmm, I'll try to look into this later, then.  I must have screwed up somewhere and Mark Stosberg is off the hook<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
