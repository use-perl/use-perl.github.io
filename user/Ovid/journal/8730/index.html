<div class="span8">
<p><p>I noticed a couple of months ago that the men upstairs switched last names on their doorbell out front.  I didn't think anything of it, but now I wonder.  Last week, a guy came by, rang my doorbell, and asked if Bob (not his name) was home.  I told him he wrang the wrong bell.  It happens.  No big deal, right?</p>

<p>Yesterday, my doorbell rings.  I'm expecting friends, but it's that guy again ... I think.  I can't be sure.  This time, he asks me if I'm Bob.  I tell him that I am not, but ask him about his visit last week.  He denies having been here.  Then he wants to know if Bob lives in the building.  I tell him there is a Bob here.  I'm pretty sure I saw this guy last week and I get a sense that being caught in a lie would not be a good idea.  He wants to know Bob's last name (which is no longer on the doorbell).  I play dumb.  He then gives me the correct last name, asking for confirmation, and I shrug and pretend not to know.  Then my friends walk up and he walks away.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, I see him sitting outside in a truck, staring at the apartment and speaking into a cell phone.  I go up the back stairs where I won't be seen, knock on the door, and Bob answers.  I tell him what's happening and he says "thanks".  I ask if he knows the guy and he denies it, trying to shut the door and end the conversation when Bob's boyfriend walks up.  He asks what's going on, Bob is desperately trying to get me out of there, there's a guy out front who doesn't know what Bob looks like, thinks I might be Bob, and Bob <em>very</em> definitely does not want to have this conversation.</p>

<p>I leave and Bob's boyfriend (who's a nice guy and a rather large bodybuilder) goes out front to the truck and asks the guy what he wants.  The guy won't say, just insists that he has to see Bob and wants to know if any Bob lives there.  Bob's boyfriend denies it, but now the guy in the truck knows the boyfriend is lying.  A friend of mine who was not seen by the truck guy walks around by the back to get the truck's license plate, but the truck is gone.</p>

<p>Bob, as far as I can tell, is the only one who might know what's happening, but he seemed strangely unconcerned about the fact that people he doesn't know have been coming around to ask about him.  My friends urge me to call the police, but I refuse.  No crime has been committed and the guy in the truck is no longer there.  This entire situation is very creepy.</p></p>
