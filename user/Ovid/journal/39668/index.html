<h1>Joining the TPF Board of Directors</h1>

<p><p>It's now been announced on the TPF blog that <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2009/09/new_board_member.html">I've joined their Board of Directors</a>.  While I assume that different directors have different interests, my first goal is to provide assistance to Dan Magnuszewski, our new PR person, with PR and marketing efforts.  I've submitted a draft proposal for a lightweight, task-oriented marketing committee, with the idea that Dan will head it.</p>

<p>We already have quite a few interesting folks lined up to help out in various aspects of this, so we can get some movement there, I think.  Most importantly, the sample charter I've submitted to the Board for discussion and approval attempts to address some issues that other TPF committees have come across.  Namely, bureaucracy, too much work and lack of redundancy.</p>

<p>Along with this, I've also stepped down from my role on the grants committee.  I've been on it for six years and need a change.  More importantly, if there are any real or perceived conflicts between the Board role and the grant committee role, this would be a bad thing.  Thus, dropping this role seems the right thing to do.</p>

<p>Here's hoping I don't bungle things too badly, but I'm sure the rest of the board is savvy enough to slap my wrist if I screw up :)</p></p>

Awesome to read about this in light of the recent marketing/PR discussion. Bodes well for Perl.
