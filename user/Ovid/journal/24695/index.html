<p><p>HOP is a wonderful book.  However, what's not wonderful about the book is the lack of strict.  I just spent 3 hours trying to track down a problem when I remembered that the code didn't use strict.  Two seconds later, I found my bug.  Grr ...</p></p>

<h2>The strict Mantra</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barbie/">barbie</a> on 2005-05-15T09:49:13</h3>
Mark and I got in to a heated debate about this on his perl-quiz list a few years ago. Mark doesn't like how many of us tell new Perl programmers to 'use strict' almost like a Mantra and has a lightning talk based on it. We have since agreed to disagree.
<p>
While this error you've spotted is possibly a typo, that wasn't in Mark's original code, to me it highlights why use strict and warnings are such useful things to include in your programs.</p>

Not only do I tell newbies to "use strict", I also tell them to "use warnings" as well. I personally believe that if something doesn't pass "use strict" (without good reason), it shouldn't be in release code.<br/><br/>HOP is a good book and has me thinking about Perl in different ways.

<p>Mark is not a fan of strictures for some bewildering reason. None of the program repair shop articles at Perl.com <code>use strict</code> either. I wonder stance his new book will take.</p>
