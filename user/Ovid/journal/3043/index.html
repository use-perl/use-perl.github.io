<p><p>I don't go to a lot of concerts, but I'm a big fan of <a href="www.spearheadvibrations.com/">Spearhead</a> and I found out that they'd be playing at the Crystal Ballroom.  I can't even begin to describe it.  They were/are incredible.  It's refreshing to see a band that actually seems to care about what's going on in the world.  If you're looking for something different, musically, pick up "Stay Human", by Michael Franti and Spearhead.  Fair warning, though:  this is a "political" album.  It's anti-death penalty and sounds like a pirate radio broadcast with the songs being interrupted by the "announcers", including some interesting "interviews".</p>

<p>Incidentally, if you recognize the voice of the Governor on the album, that's because it's Woody Harrelson.  If you really want a trip, find out who Harrelson's father is.  I'll leave it at that.</p></p>

That name (and MO) sounds familiar. Was he in a band called Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy in the early-mid 90s?

Yep, you're 100% correct.  A friend somehow managed to talk me into seeing the Disposables at 'The Junction' in Cambridge (Cambridge England, not Cambridge MA) when they were touring the "Hypocrisy is the greatest luxury" album back in the day.  I was a little relectant to go as they really were <b>not</b> my cup of tea.  But the promise of him buying me beer somehow twisted my arm.  Anyhoo, turns out they were <b>really</b> good.  The 'other' bloke in the band (name escapes me at the moment) gave us his best <i>'use power tools on stage to create pretty sparks'</i> performance as well!

<p>To be frank, I'm really not sure.  I noticed on one of their Web sites that many people mention that the "Disposable Heroes" was the vector for the Franti infection, but I didn't know if he was in that band or if his band opened for them.</p>

<p>What's really interesting is vek mentioned that<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>/s?he/</tt> didn't think Spearhead was<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>/h(er|is)?/</tt> cup o' tea until actually seeing the group.  I'm pretty much the same way.  I'm not into hip hop and I assumed that this was Spearhead's genre.  Nope.  I don't even know how to describe them, but a soul/rap combo wouldn't be too terribly innacurate.</p>

<p>I have to admit, though, that I'm surprised that there was such quick recognition.  He's fairly political and I know that many Republicrats in the US wouldn't appreciate what he has to say.</p>

To be honest, I've never heard anything by Spearhead, I was refering to the Disposable Hero's Of Hiphoprisy (the band that Michael Franti was in before forming Spearhead).  If Spearhead is anything like the Disposables were, then a sort of political/protest/rap/soul/something_or_other would "best" describe them - maybe??<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>You should check out "<i>Hypocrisy Is The Greatest Luxury</i>" by The Disposable Hero's Of Hiphoprisy - I think you might like it.
