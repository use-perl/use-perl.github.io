<p><p>ActiveState has informed me that the next run of their CPAN_RUN process (and presumably subsequent ones), will be more verbose!  Hopefully this means that you'll be able to see your test output along with any error messages.  If this works for them, it will be a huge step towards letting module authors support their code on Windows.  Thanks ActiveState!</p></p>

Did you just "thank" them?

<p>Absolutely.  Yes, I've been very frustrated by the situation at hand, but in addition to complaining, I came up with a suggestion for them that could help module authors our and they have implemented it (or have done something similar).  I realize I have sounded rather harsh about ActiveState, so it's only fair when I give them credit where it's due.  I'm quite happy they've done this.</p>

<p>I was teasing of course. I am glad you worked with them on the process so things could work better. I am almost exclusively doing stuff on Windows so your working with them ultimately helps me out and I thank you both for that.</p>

<p>I am watching the Strawberry Perl stuff with interest though. I am not sure that will replace AS on the Windows side but it will be another option.</p>
