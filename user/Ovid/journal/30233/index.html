<p><p>I just realized that while the O'Reilly people are aware of this, most others are not.  I had to pull out of OSCON.  Fortunately, my talk was with Michael Schwern, so they're not left with an empty slot, but this will be the first OSCON I've missed in years.  Because I'd be flying out the week kiddies get out of school here, I couldn't find tickets for much less than ÃÂ£800.  Given that I've just moved over here, that was a wad of my liquid reserves that I just couldn't afford to spend.</p></p>

Sorry to her that you won't be here, Ovid. We'll tie one one for you.<br><br>&#8212;Theory

<p>Thanks.  Sorry we won't be hanging out.  Maybe I can swing it next year.  I might have gotten the cost down if I had bought the ticket much sooner.  If so, this is my fault<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(</p>

Have you considered <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/euos2006/" title="oreillynet.com">Euro OSCON</a oreillynet.com> instead?<br>

<p>Hmm, tempting.  I'll have to see what I can do about that.  If I can keep my accommodations cost down, that might work.  I really want to build up a decent nest egg here because since I have no recourse to public funds, in the unlikely event anything happens to my job, I need to survive long enough to find another one.  Otherwise, I'll have to return to the US (can you tell I'm a wee bit paranoid about that?)</p>
