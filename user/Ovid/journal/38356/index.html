<div class="span8">
<p><P>Want to have fun sometime?  Take a moderately complex system, open up one of your tests which instantiates an object and put the following line in your test just after you've instantiated an object:</p>

<pre>$DB::single = 1;</pre>

<p>That sets a breakpoint so that when you run the test under the debugger (<tt>perl -d t/some_test.t</tt>), you can type 'c' and the code will run until it hits that line.  So imagine this:</p>

<pre>#!/usr/bin/env perl

use strict;
use warnings;

use Test::Most 'no_plan';

use My::ORM::Customer;   # ORM classes are great for this
use My::Test::Fixtures;
My::Test::Fixtures->load('customers');

my $customer = My::ORM::Customer->find({ id => 1 });
$DB::single  = 1;</pre>

<p>Now assuming that your code has stopped just after the <tt>$customer</tt> object has been instantiated, type this in the debugger and be amazed:</p>

<pre>m $customer</pre>

<p>In the debugger, the 'm' command tells you which methods are available on an object and which classes they're from.  I did this for a simple object we instantiate.  It's for our ORM and it represents a table with 8 fields, two of which are only for auditing. 255 methods were listed.  Two hundred and fifty-five.  They are defined across <em>twenty-seven</em> classes.  And frankly, I'm not convinced that this list is complete, but that's the debugger for you.</p>

<p>Just some food for thought.</p></p>

<h2>Change ORM !</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dami/">dami</a> on 2009-01-29T16:32:33</h3>
<p>
Well, if 255 methods/27 classes are too much for your taste, change ORM!
</p><p>
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/DAMI/DBIx-DataModel/lib/DBIx/DataModel.pm" title="cpan.org">DBIx::DataModel</a cpan.org> will only cost you about 50 methods in 3 classes (the exact number depends on how many relationships there are between this table and other tables).

<p>Well, I doubt I could push that through at work, but I suspect that I'd be inclined to go the SQL dictionary route.  Still, just glancing at it, DBIx::DataModel looks interesting.</p>

<p>It <em>is</em> lovely! I have been using it for a while and it has worked out every bit as well as I had hoped for. Sometimes I had to change the shape of my queries a little to accommodate it, but I have yet to run into a wall due to the fundamental design. There were stumbling blocks in cases where I ran into corners that Dave hadn&#8217;t built out yet &#8211; f.ex. when I first started with it, it failed if you tried to join against a table alias, which I needed for my tag (as in &#8220;folksonomy&#8221;) joins. (I do those by adding a variable number of inner self-joins on the tag table, each join needing its own `WHERE` clause, depending on the number of specified tags.) However that was merely an issue of incomplete implementation and he has been very responsive about fixing my gripes.</p><p>I hope more people pick up Fey, and have been cheerleading for it for a while now. (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/480424/assembling-sql-in-an-object-oriented-fashion/480779#480779" title="stackoverflow.com">See StackOverflow</a stackoverflow.com>, f.ex.) With more people beating on it the rough edges would hopefully soon be smoothed out, and the principal design is <em>exactly</em> what I have always wanted when I examined ORMs: a way to layer those abstractive facilities on top of SQL that SQL itself lacks, while still writing queries directly, rather than implying them through navigation of an OO model of a query result.</p>

I know this is rather irrational - but the thing that off puts me from Fey is that the connection is kept in a singleton.  This leads to the need of not very DRY declarations:<br/><br/><code><br/><br/>package Forum::Model::User;
use Forum::Model::Schema;
use Fey::ORM::Table;<br/><br/>has_table( Forum::Model::Schema-&gt;Schema()-&gt;table('User') );
</code><br/><br/>It could be just:<br/><br/><code><br/><br/>package Forum::Model::User;
use base Forum::Model::Schema;<br/><br/>has_table( 'User' )
</code><br/><br/>I am acustomed to the DBIC way of having a normal Schema object that keeps the connection and represents the database.

I've already asked him about the possibility of shortening the declarations.  The answer was that that it probably mean too much magic - which is, in my opinion, only the consequence of using 'magic' signletons in the first place.  I will not ask him about getting rid of that - since I would not expect any productive answer - this is too basic design choice to change in the mid-work.
