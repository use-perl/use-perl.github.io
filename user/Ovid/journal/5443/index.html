<p><p>I was at a barbecue recently and one of the women there was legally blind.  She could see, but barely.  She accidentally dropped her food on the rug and smeared barbecue sauce and meat drippings everywhere.  She asked the hostess for cleaning supplies.  She got on her hands and knees and was only a couple of inches from the rug, looking for the stains.</p>

<p>When she stood up, smiling and obviously pleased with herself, it still looked like someone had sacrificed a puppy on the rug.  The hostess watched, but didn't say anything, evidentally suffering from acute embarrassment.  Everyone else made a concerted effort to stare at their plate.</p>

<p>And on a lighter note:  some poetry.  A Y2K haiku</p>

<p>Was Y2K real?<br>
It was being worked on by<br>
Men who can't find dates.<br></p></p>

Barbecue + Carpeting = Disaster
<p>
There's a good reason barbecuing is thought of as an outdoors activity; mainly, the outdoors don't require cleaning to appear appealing to most people.</p>
