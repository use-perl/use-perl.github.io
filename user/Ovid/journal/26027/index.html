<p><p>Last night I didn't get much sleep, so I was terribly disappointed to find myself having trouble staying awake during Damian's "Presentation Aikido" talk.  I wound up being the guinea pig for his "bar fight" demo and then went back to my chair and struggled to keep my eyes awake.  I was actually most embarrassed by this.  The break and two more cups of coffee helped tremendously.</p>

<p>My summary of his talk:  if you must give a presentation, you must see his talk.  His humour (sic), integrity, and complete comfort with the subject matter make this talk one of the best I've seen.  After I got home, the first thing I did was open up my laptop and go through my talk again, improving it, making corrections, and doing a <em>spoken</em> rehearsal of the talk.  I was surprised at how I stumbled on spots I know like the back of my hand.</p>

<p>My talk is the last talk on the last day of the conference.  Not only will that reduce attendance, but there are two other Perl talks scheduled at the same time and one of them is Dominus.  Given how obscure my subject matter is for many, this won't help.  I also have to confess that despite how I enjoy logic programming, Dominus subject matter is interesting enough that I'd be tempted to go to his talk in lieu of mine.  As Luke Palmer said to me "I want to be a superposition."</p>

<p>I also was disappointed to not run into Bill Odom today.  He has great ideas for TPF and I'm most curious to see how things pan out.</p></p>

<h2>Question on OSCON</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2005-08-02T12:21:53</h3>
Do they alternate east coast and west coast?

Not so far. It's always been on the west coast of the USA. First few were in California and they've moved to Oregon for the last few years.<br><br>If you'd like something a little further east, then there's always Euro OSCON in Amsterdam this October<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

I think maybe I will just save for the next big Perl conference.  : )

Are you joking?  OSCON <i>is</i> the "big Perl Conference", having started as "TPC (The Perl Conference)" for the first few years, then adding other open source software as time went on.

<p>Actually I was not kidding. I was not aware of what you said though. I was thinking more along the lines of a YAPC when I made my statement.</p>

<p>I retract my statement though and I will start saving for next years.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) </p>

YAPC was invented, in part, to have a conference that was both cheaper and further east than The Perl Conference.  It's on the east coast and costs about a hundred bucks.  Less, every time so far, actually.<br><br>OSCON has more material, and often better material, but YAPC is more perlish overall, in more ways than just content.
