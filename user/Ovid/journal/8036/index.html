<p><p>I guess I'm trying to see how many stupid things I can do in one week.  I had some tests fail because I copied a hashref -- not the hash it pointed to -- deleted a key, and forgot that this is essentially an <em>alias</em>, not a copy, and thus corrupted my original hash.</p>

<p>In other stupidities, I discovered that the new Perl Mongers Group Leader mailing list is set up to reply to the group by default not to the author of the email, thus leading me to post the following to the list, rather than being a private reply:</p>

<blockquote>Ah, sheesh, I knew it.  My Perl Mongers group is going to be labeled a terrorist organization and
our national Secret Police ... ahem ... FBI, are going to want to talk to me.  I suppose it's only
a matter of time before Bush threatens to invade Portland (of course, his dad referred to
Portland, Oregon as Little Beirut, so it would fit his family history :)</blockquote>

<p>Hopefully, my apology to the list will be well-received.</p>

<p>And many, many thanks to Dave Cross for breathing life into the corpse. (I don't know what that means, either)</p>

<p>As for the other stupid thing, I ain't gonna tell you.  L knows what it is, but she isn't saying anything, either.  Mutual stupidity is a "grin and bear it" affair.  Fortunately, it wasn't too serious of a screw-up.</p></p>
