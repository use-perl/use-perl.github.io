<p><p>I could be wrong as I'm not actually tracking my behavior, but it seems like I'm reading /. less and less (or least spending less time there per visit).  In large part it's because when I go there, most of the stories already seem to be on Digg.  Anyone else noticing this?</p></p>

<h2>Digg</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Beatnik/">Beatnik</a> on 2006-11-23T07:57:26</h3>
Digg has most of the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/. on slashdot.. earlier.. but it also has tons of 'Whooo.. Kevin Rose is sooooo great' posts and since it's user moderated, a lot of fakes sneak in as well. I read both, plus a few others.

<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2006-11-23T08:11:55</h3>
<p>Yeah, there are a lot of fakes.  Recently there were diggs for "C in 24 Hours" and the C++ version.  I didn't bother to follow either story because I assumed they were marketing attempts.  Still, the vast quantity of stories there makes it easier for me to spot relevant things that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/. might overlook.  But you're right about the ridiculously poor quality of many posts.  That's one area<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/. still still beats digg.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/Adrian/">Adrian</a> on 2006-11-23T09:45:10</h3>
... at least thinking "Hmm... lets see what<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/. have to say".<br><br>Anything I'd be vaguely interested in turns up in somebody's blog, so I do read the occasional story. But visit the site? Pretty much never.

Personally, I prefer <a href="http://diggdot.us/" title="diggdot.us">http://diggdot.us/</a diggdot.us>, which combines Slashdot, Digg, Del.icio.us and Reddit; each of these sources can be included/excluded if you register as a user.



<h2>Digg?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2006-11-23T13:54:15</h3>
Hmmm, I still read slashdot.  But I don't read digg.  I tried it a while back, didn't find much I liked and haven't been back.

<p>I've just spent a few minutes with it again, and I still can't see much to tempt me to spend any time there regularly.  Yet still everybody's talking about it.  What am I missing?

Slashdot is one of the feeds I read through <a href="http://bloglines.com/public/davorg/" title="bloglines.com">Bloglines</a bloglines.com>. And if anything looks interesting then I'll clickthru and read the story. That might happen a couple of times a day.<br><br>But I _never_ read the comments.<br>

<p>Careful there, Dave.  You keep that up and the Christians are going to remember Luke 19:27.  (Actually, they've remembered it for a long time and used it for many justifications, but they generally don't like to talk about it any more).</p>

<p>For those inclined to lash out at me, I know that's embedded in a parable.  The parable, in part, seems to suggest that the coming of the Lord is not imminent, but the faithful must go forth and do the work of the Lord.  And like much of the Koran, it can be interpreted pretty much how a particular individual wants it to be interpreted.</p>

The only way I tend to end up on SlashDot is through <a href="http://seenonslash.com/" title="seenonslash.com">SeenOnSlash.com</a seenonslash.com>. It's like Reader's Digest for SlashDot.
