<p><p>I'm disappointed to see that the Firefox RC 2 does not yet have <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/998/">tagged bookmarks</a> available natively.  (No, I ain't talkin' 'bout <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>).</p>

<p>Frankly, I want just about every heirarchical <em>thing</em> to go away.  Give me tagged bookmarks, tagged filesystems and so on.  (I seem to recall reading about a filesystem experiment which dispensed with directories and used tags instead, but I can't recall where I read that.)</p></p>

<h2>Places</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2006-10-12T01:24:20</h3>
<p>The feature is called Places and includes the browsing history along with the bookmarks. They turned it off a while ago because it was too big a feature to land in time for 2.0.</p>

2.0 of what? There are actually several active explorations of non-hierarchical file classification, including Apple's Spotlight, Reiser4fs, BeOS, and WinFS was understood to be going in this direction.

<p>I think you meant <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Places" title="mozilla.org">http://wiki.mozilla.org/Places</a mozilla.org> (note the lack of trailing slash).</p>

Indeed I did, thanks.  It's become habit for me to "fix" URLs that lack trailing slashes.<br><br>Though I think mediawiki shouldn't take a trailing slash as part of the page name, I'm not going to start a jihad to get them to clean that up.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>I wrote my own</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dakkar/">dakkar</a> on 2006-10-12T07:37:25</h3>
<p>I wrote a little Catalyst webapp and use it in the sidebar. Ok, I have to be on a machine that has access to my home VPN to change my bookmarks, but I can read them from everywhere and every browser.</p>
<p>The source can be found on my home Trac: <a href="http://thenautilus.dyndns.org/trac/browser/Bookmarks/trunk" title="dyndns.org">http://thenautilus.dyndns.org/trac/browser/Bookmarks/trunk</a dyndns.org>, and the application can be seen live on the same system: <a href="http://thenautilus.dyndns.org/bookmarks/tags" title="dyndns.org">http://thenautilus.dyndns.org/bookmarks/tags</a dyndns.org></p>



<h2>WinFS (RIP)</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Corion/">Corion</a> on 2006-10-12T07:38:16</h3>
<p>WinFS was said to have SQL query capabilities and basically be a tagged filesystem. If you look at the WMI, you can still query the filesystem through an SQL-like language, but as the underlying system is not a database, querying is slow. Unfortunately, WinFS got cut from Windows, so we'll be stuck with a tree (plus symlinks).</p>
<p>I wrote me a small <a href="http://corion.net/perl-dev/FFRIndexed.html" title="corion.net">tagged filesystem</a corion.net> for my mediaserver and even tied it to Windows via WebDAV, but as this doesn't achieve full integration into the Windows explorer and writing userspace filesystems is surprisingly hard or underdocumented on Win32, I dropped the filesystem approach and went with the HTTP+browser approach.</p>
<p>Querying your filesystem through SQL is massively cool - it made finding suitable images to display as a cover for an mp3 collection insanely easy for example. No need to walk up a directory tree or whatever - just a query for similarly named files with a mime_type like image/% and the "right" size.</p>
<p>Of course, my approach suffers from its lack of filesystem integration - the database/filesystem has to be rescanned from time to time so they don't go out of sync.</p>



<h2>tags vs. hierarchies</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2006-10-18T06:58:35</h3>
I like hierarchies.  Well, better than tags, anyway.<br><br>Maybe if tags were created for me without having to do anything (literally), then that would be one thing.  I like time-based systems (like Apple's Time Machine<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... in concept, anyway).  I don't have to do anything.  But I simply will not take the time to tag anything, let alone a bookmark.<br><br>I know some people really like tags, and I am not arguing tags are bad, and I recognize the power of them,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... it's just that I can never bring myself to spend time tagging things.<br><br>The one exception is photos, but that is because I am to the point where I force myself to tag all my photos in iPhoto, because there's simply no other way.  Even then, though, I just have a set of about 15 tags I reuse.  No more.  Too much effort to actually type in tags for each, so I use the "keywords" thing and drag a whole bunch of photos at once to a keyword.<br>
