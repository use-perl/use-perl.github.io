<p><p>This is their first full day of using the system.  It turns out that their comments about the report numbers being off were simply bad math.  We have a couple of bugs to work out and a feature that needs to be added, but everything's on track.  In short - <b>We Did It! :)</b></p>

<p>The owner of our company gave us Friday the fifth off, so that, combined with the Fourth of July holiday (U.S. Independence day, for you non-US folk), gives me a four day weekend to look forward to.  A much needed four day weekend, I might add.  My thoughts are a lot of R&R and perhaps just a wee bit too much scotch...</p>

<p>Tests:  exactly 1000</p></p>

Good job.<br> <p>I may have pulled the trigger on the <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=6307&amp;cid=9742" title="perl.org">congratulations too early a few days back</a perl.org>, but now, I want to be the first to congratulate you on what seems like an excellent job on a very short fuse.  <br> </p><p>I really appreciate your sharing the story here.  Thanks.</p>

<p>Thanks.  What really convinced me that we had pulled this off was when the company who developed their old POS system realized that they were going to get dumped, they went ahead and gave our client a new registration key, but after using our system, our client said "no thanks" to the old vendor.  We aren't nearly as functional, but we seemed to have earned some trust.</p>
