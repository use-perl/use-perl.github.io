<p><p>Needless to say, given my rather well-known political views, I was a bit stressed out election night.  Two of my best friends kept heading outside to smoke and I joined them ... but I didn't smoke.  I'm now in my fifth week of not smoking and I was surprised at how well I held up.</p>

<p>Last night, though, I finally broke down.  I desperately wanted to do <em>something</em>, but not do something that I would significantly regret later.  So I ate meat.  I didn't get drunk.  I didn't smoke.  I ate half a pepperoni pizza.  Somehow I felt better.  Go figure.</p></p>

I was going to eat a big bag of M&amp;Ms.  Luckily, instead I had sushi, which isn't all that out of the ordinary, but it was quite good.
