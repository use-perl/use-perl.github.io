<div class="span8">
<p><p>Recently I was trying to <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.qa/5887">write a grammar for TAP</a>.  With a grammar, I could write a parser and people could refer to a canonical grammar to know if their TAP implementation is correct.  That grammar is incomplete and has bugs (for example, I didn't account for newlines), but it's a start.</p>

<p>I ran into several problems, most of which can be solved by folks coming to a concensus on how some things should be handled.  However, there's one bit to the grammar which I don't know how to write.  Consider this snippet of TAP:</p>

<pre>ok 6 - ... or if it is zero
ok 7 - ... or not an integer
ok 8 - ... but a positive integer should not cause it to die</pre>

<p>The relevant section of grammar might resemble this:</p>

<pre>tests       ::= test {test};
test        ::= status (positiveNumber description) newLine
status      ::= 'not '? 'ok ';
description ::= (character - (digit '#')) {character - '#'};</pre>

<p>See a problem with that?  How do I use a grammar to indicate that each <tt>positiveNumber</tt> must be one greater than the previous <tt>positiveNumber</tt> and that said numbers must begin with the number 1 (one)?</p>

<p>(The title of this post should have been "EBNF Grammar Nazis wanted")</p></p>

<h2>positiveNumber</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2006-06-30T16:19:33</h3>
I don't think you can model a 'sequential nondecreasing positive number' with a pure EBNF grammar.  The grammar is for constructing the parser, to determine if the input is syntactically correct.  What you are asking for is a semantic check that is beyond the scope of the parser (at least before you start peppering the grammar with state variables and code).<br><br>Put differently, pure EBNF can't handle what you are asking, but lex can.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>Context-free grammar</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/iburrell/">iburrell</a> on 2006-06-30T17:20:15</h3>
I wouldn't be surprised if the matching increasing sequence of numbers can't be calculated with a context-free grammar.  EBNF (and most parsers) implement a context-free grammar.

<p>
Adding extra code to check the constraint makes the most sense to me.</p>



<h2>What Ziggy said</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pemungkah/">pemungkah</a> on 2006-06-30T19:49:40</h3>
The BNF exists only to tell you what the syntax is. The semantics determine what is actually done, given that the language presented is accurate.<br><br>So your BNF should specify a leading number, the dots, the comment, the newline. This allows a lexer to read the language and say "yes, that is a valid line of TAP" or "no, it's not valid because<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...".<br><br>Take this example:<br><br>
&nbsp; &lt;value&gt;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:= &lt;value&gt; + &lt;term&gt; | &lt;term&gt;<br><br>So we've defined that a value is one or more terms, separated by '+'. We have not defined what the operation does, but we have defined that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;term&gt;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;term&gt;+&lt;term&gt;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;term&gt;+&lt;term&gt;+&lt;term&gt;+&lt;term&gt;<br><br>are all valid <i>syntactically</i>. It could be concatenation, or addition, or a series of subroutine calls, or whatever else we've decided '+' means.<br><br>so you have a few lines that specify that a test plan is &lt;digits&gt;..&lt;digits&gt;&lt;newline&gt;. It's up to the semantics to determine that the first number should be 1, and that the last one should be &gt; 1, and that at the end of the input, all of the numbers between 1 and the second one were found, in ascending order.<br><br>lex and yacc actually confuse the issue because they're not just parsers; they add in sematics too.



<h2>Not the right tool</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rafael/">rafael</a> on 2006-07-01T10:21:11</h3>
As a grammar nazi (I wrote a number of complex grammars and even an LL(infinite) parser generator), I think that a context-free grammar is definitively not the Right Tool for this Job. (Likewise, it's not the right tool for parsing XML or YAML, for example.)
