<p><p>A few days ago, I finally broke down and decided to jettison my "poec" yahoo email address even though I've had that address for years.  I sent email to most of my friends letting them know that I can be reached at "curtis_ovid_poe" -- and it's still at the Yahoo! domain (ugh.  It seems silly to be so circumspect just to avoid address harvesters).  I've also elected not to forward my easystreet or ovidinexile email to my new address so I'll have to update some information on my Web site.</p>

<p>While I still check the old email -- there are a few things I've missed -- most of my traffic has been redirected to my new email account.  I've been very careful about what I use my new address for (I don't get CNN news emailed to me, for instance) and so far, it's been <em>weird</em> not having a single spam.  I am clearly getting the email traffic that I'm supposed to get, but opening up my inbox and seeing that I don't have another 50 spam that's accumulated while I'm sleeping has almost made me feel neglected :)</p>

<p>I wonder how long this will last.</p></p>

Hi,<br/><br/>Have you been using the Yahoo spam filter? It blocks about 90% of the spam I get in my yahoo account.

<p>I had been using it.  However, I still get false negatives and positives.  What ultimately made it too much hassle was that I would routinely have to scan through hundreds of spam to see if any legitimate email was listed as spam.  I know that I have missed more than one good email as a result.  One friend of mine was rather put out that I didn't respond to an "important" email.</p>

Yeah, I only get about 10-15 spams a day, so it's not too difficult to take a quick peek.<br/><br/>I think the only real way to avoid spam is change your email address once a year.
