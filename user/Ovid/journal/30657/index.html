<p><p>Love him, hate him, or just be damned envious of him, David Heinemeier Hansson, the creator or Ruby on Rails, <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000474.html">often has astute things to say</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Java has become a mace (sic) of complexity because of the attempt to shield developers from [complexity]. So that screws up the intention to help the lower levels.</blockquote>

<p>(Forgive him for his typos; English is not his first language.  There's no excuse for my typos.)</p>

<p>I'm sure many will agree, but here's my interpretation of what David has to say.</p>

<p>Hire ten monkeys and you'll get work worthy of ten monkeys!</p>

<p>Duh.</p>

<p>Many good programmers were initially attracted to Java due to what it offered and many of them stay there for the job prospects.  Though I admire what Paul Graham has to say on the subject, I don't believe for a second that great hackers don't use Java.  Look at James Duncan Davidson.  He's a great hacker and he used Java for many years.  Admittedly, he's turned away from it, but it's not like he used Java and became a code monkey while he was doing it.</p>

<p>Great programmers also use Java but because the language puts handcuffs on you, it's difficult to paint the ceiling of the cathedral.  Put a glass ceiling on abstractions and certain levels of complexity become impossible to manage.  (How's that for mixed yet slightly coupled metaphors?)</p></p>

<h2>Java? Do I really need to?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2006-08-16T22:11:47</h3>
I have a co-worker that won't do program in anything but Java. We "talk" back and forth because I really don't want to use Java. I would rather stick to Tcl and Perl for getting stuff done. I have yet to find something where Java is *the* language to use. About the only thing that I do like about Java is the Oracle thin client so I don't have to pack around the actual client to use the db.



<h2>Macey (shades of Gray)</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pjm/">pjm</a> on 2006-08-17T00:49:47</h3>
I think he really does mean "mace" there: as in "something with spikey bits that causes damage". Mace/shield/la la la...<br><br>cf "dumped down", a deliberate near homonym. No real problems with English that I can detect, even if his prose has a very distinctive *grain*!



<h2>&amp;#8220;Common sense&amp;#8221; is the biggest misnomer</h2>

<blockquote> <div><p>Hire ten monkeys and you&#8217;ll get work worthy of ten monkeys!</p></div> </blockquote>

<p>Yeah, one might be inclined to &#8220;d&#8217;uh&#8221; &#8211; if only the management and businesspeople actually understood that notion&#8230;</p>
