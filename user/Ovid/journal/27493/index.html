<h1>The Case of the Intransigent Intransitive Verb</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2005-11-07T00:10:47</h2>
</div> <!-- /span4 -->


<div class="span8">
<p><p>It was a complete mystery.  My beautifully implemented <tt>Model::World</tt> test had the following line of code:</p>

<pre>$player->put($box, $ring);</pre>

<p>And that dies with the message:</p>

<pre>You can't put anything in the player</pre>

<p>The intent was, when a player receives a message, it assumes it has a verb, an optional object, and zero or more arguments after that.  However, the box, ring, and player classes are all subclasses of the <tt>Thing</tt> class.  This was bad.  Everytime I add a possible "Verb" to the box class, player should not automatically inherit it.  Instead, the player should always be able to inspect a thing and figure out what it can do.  I can override <tt>put</tt> in the player class, but every time I add a verb for the box class, I have to remember to override it in the player class.  This is wrong.</p>

<p>Instead, I need to create an "abstract thing" class which provides only the tiniest amount of code.  Then the player can inherit from the abstract thing class and a "item" (bad name) or other class can also inherit from that and the box and ring inherit from the item class.  Thus I avoid bad inheritance.</p>

<p>The comes a real problem:  what can a player do?  A player can "do" any verb the player defines.  These are often intransitive verbs, verbs which do not take a direct object.  For example, "Johns jumps" has an intransitive verb.  A player can also "do" any verb a thing allows.  If a Box class supplies a "break" method (and verb), then "John breaks the box" is allowed and this calls the "box-&gt;break" method.</p>

<p>The problem comes in when a verb can be used either transitively or intrasitively.  A player can just "look around" and we have an intransitive verb.  What if a player looks at another player?  Now it's not an intransitive verb.  I can't just "player2-&gt;look".  So now when actions are performed, I'll have to consider whether the invocant is the subject or the object of the action.  I'm sure there is a simple way of doing this, but I'm going to have to mull over this for a while.</p></p>

<code>sub look {<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; if ($self == $object) {<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... }<br>

<h2>Two actions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/VSarkiss/">VSarkiss</a> on 2005-11-07T14:51:13</h3>
<p>It sounds like you have two different methods, <code>look_around</code> and <code>look_at</code>.  The former doesn't take an object, the latter does.</p>



<h2>OT: Agents</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Theory/">Theory</a> on 2005-11-07T16:09:11</h3>
Are the agents of verbs (the subjects) always players? Could they be other things (bots, monsters, etc.)? Perhaps the class should be Agent rather than Player.<br><br>&#x2014;Theory
