<h1>AI::Prolog/AI::Logic to Sourceforge?</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>I've been giving a lot of thought to starting a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/index.php">Sourceforge</a> project for my logic programming work.  I generally view <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=AI%3A%3AProlog&mode=module">AI::Prolog</a> as a prototype for <tt>AI::Logic</tt>.  I see parallel projects where the former is a pure Perl implementation for prototyping and testing and the latter is written in Inline::C or XS with the same interface but reasonable performance.  However, there are problems with this approach.</p>

<p>First, I'd like help.  Collaborating via personal email doesn't work very well for me.  Second, others have expressed an interest in helping or learning, but handling this one person at a time is not very effective.  I think having a mailing list would help and having a project where people could always check out the latest sources could also be useful.  Very few Perl programmers really appreciate the power available here, so I think a coordinated effort to "spread the news" might help.</p>

<p>I'm used to leading stuff like this is a business setting, but in an open-source environment I'm used to working alone or submitting patches.  This is a rather new thought to me.</p></p>

<h2>Interfaces</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/drhyde/">drhyde</a> on 2005-02-02T09:45:21</h3>
Can I suggest that rather than calling an XS version something different like AI::Logic, you call it AI::Prolog::XS or AI::Prolog_XS, in the same way that we have Text::CSV and Text::CSV_XS?  This makes it much clearer that they have the same API.

<p>As for going to sourceforge, I'd recommend against it.  Sourceforge is irritating to use and doesn't really offer anything that you can't do yourself.  All that's needed is a mailing list and a public CVS repository.

</p><p>And good luck recruiting little helpers.  The task interests me enough that I've grabbed AI::Prolog and played with it, but my knowledge of Prolog is pretty limited and so I'd not be comfortable hacking on this.  I expect that's a very common state of affairs.</p>

<p>The main problem with calling the XS version <tt>AI::Prolog::XS</tt> or something similar is that it ties me to Prolog.  I want logic programming to be available and while I will always have the Prolog interface avaiable via <tt>AI::Prolog</tt> (hence the name), I am not sure that I want that always available via <tt>AI::Logic</tt>.  If I want to offer non-standard predicates to <tt>AI::Logic</tt> or I find that seriously mutating the way the logic engine works will better facilitate the needs of Perl users I don't want the module name to make false implications.</p>

<p>As for Sourceforge, what are decent alternatives?  I have no intention of opening up anything on my personal boxes and I don't want to pay for hosting somewhere if I can avoid it.  Also, Sourceforge does offer more than just a mailing list and CVS repository (though the latter gives me pause.  I much prefer Subversion.)  I'm open to alternatives.  Other than slow CVS updates, can you offer specific gripes about it?  I really don't know anything about Sourceforge.</p>

Good arguments re module naming, so I'll shut up now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<p>Sourceforge irritates me as a casual user wanting to grab the code from some random project because the user interface just SUCKS so very very hard.  As a programmer, I have another minor gripe mostly related to the amount of abandonware on there.

</p><p>That said, my objections to Sourceforge mostly go away if you don't want to host your own lists and public repository.  It's better than nothing.</p>



<h2>GForge</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/naughton/">naughton</a> on 2005-02-03T03:37:41</h3>
<p> <a href="http://gforge.org/" title="gforge.org">GForge</a gforge.org> may be a good alternative to Sourceforge. Started by original Sourceforge developer Tim Perdue, it's a fork of the once-open Sourceforge code. It supports Subversion as well as CVS and claims to be much-improved. I haven't used it, but have read <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/2363" title="oreillynet.com">positive reviews</a oreillynet.com>.</p>

<p>BTW, your posts routinely contain great technical info. Thanks, Ovid!</p>

<p>Whoa.  That looks interesting.  Thanks for the heads up.</p>
