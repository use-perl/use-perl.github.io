<p><p>A couple of years ago, I put together a large system and was punished for my mistakes by having to maintain it.  Now, I've been tasked with accomplishing almost exactly the same thing with a brand new system.  After only a week of work, it's stunning to see how completely different the design is on the two of them.  I have a variety of reasonably designed and well-separated layers to handle what needs to be done.  The only significant lack is that work-flow is handled procedurally, but (as usual) I'm on a relatively short timeframe and don't have the time to put in all of the bells and whistles that I would like.  The nice thing is, once this part is finished, we have quite a number of clients who are ready to purchase it.  Money Good.</p>

<p>Another positive experience is that I'm lead on this project with a new co-worker who didn't write many tests.  Because we're working together (though not pair programming), he has no choice but to write tests and he's actually done a great job of it.  With only a week of work, we have well over 300 tests between the two of us.</p></p>
