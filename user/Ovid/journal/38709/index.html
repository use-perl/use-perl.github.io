<p><p>It's a bit late for an informal poll, but I didn't think of it sooner :)</p>

<p>I'll be heading to the <a href="http://qa-hackathon.org/">Perl-QA Hackathon</a> in a few hours.  I'll be spending three days holed up with core Perl QA people, and then a couple of days in <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=cumbria&hl=en&um=1&imgtype=photo&as_st=y">Cumbria</a> with Andy Armstrong and Schwern.  So three people with responsibility for Test::Harness and Test::Builder will be stuck with each other for five whole days.</p>

<p>Things I would desperately love:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nested TAP (<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Aggregate/">Test::Aggregate</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Class/">Test::Class</a> could both have fun with this)</li>
  <li>Structured TAP diagnostics</li>
  <li>More features from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Most/">Test::Most</a> supported directly by <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Simple/lib/Test/Builder.pm">Test::Builder</a><li>
</ul>

<p>What I want, though, may be useless to you, so let's hear it.</p>

<p>Nested TAP would be good, I think. I'm planning on getting Test::Class::Sugar to a releaseable point over the weekend, and hopefully making a good start on something like cucumber <a href="http://cukes.info/" title="cukes.info">http://cukes.info/</a cukes.info> with Devel::Declare driven syntax, though I might get sidetracked into trying to write a perlish autotest if such a thing doesn't already exist.</p><p>Both those (and definitely the cucumber port) would benefit from nestability.</p><p>I'm not sure when I'm going to get there - won't be there 'til Saturday morning.</p>

<p>.. Another vote for nested TAP here for obvious reasons!</p><p>Me, I hope to fix some of the more broken bits of the T::C internals, make whatever changes Piers needs for T::C::Sugar, and knock a few of the things off the T::C to do list.</p><p>Along with anything else that seems useful<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p><p>I'm also going to annoy Curtis with a long conversation about TDD. Especially if I get around to finishing up the blog post(s) that have been sitting on my desktop for the last week<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>(Also - I want to get Curtis to educate me about Role based design... but that's not QA related)</p>

<p>Bring me some sample code which abuses inheritance (multiple inheritance and several levels of inheritance are good), and I can help you refactor it.  You'll be amazed at what RO (Role Oriented) Programming can do.</p><p>Or if there's something tractable on the CPAN, I could play with that.</p>

<p>Nested TAP++<br>TAP Diagnostics ++</p><p>Also, I was planning on finally getting some time to give Smolder some love. I've got a list of features from the Parrot developers and am also in the middle of a rewrite to ditch apache and use a Perl HTTP server and make it CPAN installable.</p>
