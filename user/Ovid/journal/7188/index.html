<p><p>Well, I <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=190792">met with the high school teacher</a> tonight.  He seems very bright, has a decent knowledge of computers, but has never programmed before.  Since he's been "volunteered" to teach a Perl class that starts in about three weeks, he's got a very tough job ahead of him.</p>

<p>I worked with him on his syllabus and we've come up with a plan.  Since he also teaches Web design. he's going to be focusing on basic Perl/CGI.  It has the advantage of "sex appeal" for the students and he can use his HTML knowledge.  His first couple of weeks will actually be spent teach HTML basics, so he'll have a total of five weeks of Perl experience under his belt if he starts doing <em>his homework</em> now.  Of course, since he also has to teach other classes, I worry about his free time to tackle this.</p>

<p>The syllabus actually looks doable.  I'm a bit nervous about have students learn HTML, Perl, and CGI all at the same time, but this will only be the basics of those, so hopefully this will work.  Of course, I'm going to have nightmares about new versions of Matt's Script Archive popping up all over the Web.</p></p>
