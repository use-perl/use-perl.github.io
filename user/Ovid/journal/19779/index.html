<div class="span8">
<p><p>Sometimes it gets very frustrating searching through the metadata of Oracle to find what what I want, particularly since I don't have the shell handy.  Getting tired of this, I wrote a simple Perl program, <tt>qsql</tt> which allows me to execute a lot of queries without using Oracle's pitiful SQLPlus.  After fine-tuning it, I realized that most of the things I need to use it for are amenable to further tweaking.  I can now do things like:</p>

<pre>$ desc ti_releases | grep COUNTRY_ID
ti_releases.COUNTRY_ID                NOT NULL  VARCHAR2(5)</pre>

<p>Want a quick description of every table whose name contains the word "product"?</p>

<pre>$ for table in `tabs product`; do desc $table; done;</pre>

<p>And then I can grep for the fields I am really looking for.  It's the full power of bash with most of my most commonly needed database search tools.</p></p>

<p>It still has work a fair amount of work that it needs and it's specific to Oracle, but if you want to see the core of it (fair warning, it's a sloppy hack):</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>use Text::CSV_XS;;<br> <br>my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect(...);<br>my $sql = @ARGV &gt; 1<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; ? join ' ' =&gt; @ARGV<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; : shift;<br> <br>$sql = munge_sql($dbh, $sql) || die "No sql supplied";<br> <br>if ($sql =~<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/^\s*desc\s*(\w+)/) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; desc_tables_and_exit($dbh, $sql, $1);<br>}<br> <br>print "Executing ($sql)\n" if $ENV{DEBUG};<br>my $sth;<br>{<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; local $^W; # stop some silly internal warning<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare($sql);<br>}<br> <br>$sth-&gt;execute;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;my $csv = Text::CSV_XS-&gt;new<br>while (my @data = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_array) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $status = $csv-&gt;combine(@data);<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; print $csv-&gt;string(), "\n";<br>}<br> <br>$dbh-&gt;disconnect;<br> <br>sub desc_tables_and_exit {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my ($dbh, $sql, $table) = @_;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $sth = $dbh-&gt;column_info({TABLE_NAME =&gt; uc($1)});<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $format = "$table.%-30s %-8s %-20s\n";<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $description = '';<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; while (my $data = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_arrayref) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my ($name, $type, $length1, $length2, $null) = @{$data}[3,5,6,7,17];<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $null = $null eq 'YES' ?

I call the above program <tt>qsql</tt>, so my <tt>desc</tt> and <tt>tabs</tt> (table names) utilities are:</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>#/bin/sh<br>$HOME/bin/qsql desc $1</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>and</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>#/bin/sh<br>$HOME/bin/qsql tabs $1</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>You can also write simple select statements from the command line with my <tt>sel</tt> utility:</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>sel name from users where login_id = \'ovid\'</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>Implemented with:</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>#/bin/sh<br>$HOME/bin/qsql "select $*"</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>Again, everything is very specific to Oracle and it's not rocket science, but it's very, very useful to me.  Note that the <tt>desc</tt> utility will only describe tables, not views.  That can be confusing if you don't know what you're looking for isn't a real table.</p>

<p>This doesn't need to be Oracle specific if you use the 'table_info' method. In fact, you're calling 'column_info' in a deprecated style (though in past docs, I can only tell that the style was once valid for 'table_info'). Since the 'table_info' and 'column_info' methods allow wildcards for the table name, you could do all the tricky parts with just those methods.</p>
<blockquote><div> <em>it's a sloppy hack...</em> </div></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, there is a bit of slop in that you pass the table name to the desc_tables_and_exit function, but use the captured match from the previous function instead of the passed arg, and that the dbh is passed but not used in munge_sql<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

I should also admit that I've never actually used the table_info OR the column_info methods<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) But then, I do most all my <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=302521" title="perlmonks.org">SQL from vi(m)?</a perlmonks.org> anyway.

<h2>What did you dislike about existing shells?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/btilly/">btilly</a> on 2004-07-12T23:38:58</h3>
What existing shells you ask?  Well several co-workers use a hacked up version of <a href="http://piqt.sourceforge.net/" title="sourceforge.net">piqt</a sourceforge.net>.  I suspect that <a href="http://dbishell.sourceforge.net/" title="sourceforge.net">dbishell</a sourceforge.net> is going to provide more functionality out of the box.  The latter page points at several more to look at.<p>

Perhaps another way to state this question is, "What features are you really looking for in a project like this?"</p>

<p>I didn't know about those others but it looks like they might provide what I was looking for.  Basically, I wanted to interact with the database without leaving Bash.  By building a few small utilities that interacted with one another, I have the database directly in the shell.  If these other projects provide that as seamlessly, I'll probably go with one of them.  Thanks for the heads up.</p>
