<h1>PerlySense for Vim</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>If you haven't seen <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-PerlySense/">Devel::PerlySense</a>, I highly recommend that you check it out.  It's a relatively new project by Johan LindstrÃÂ¶m to bring Intellisense functionality to Perl.</p>

<p>In your .vimrc, make sure you have the following line:</p>

<pre>filetype plugin on</pre>

<p>In your <tt>.vim/ftplugin/</tt> directory, create a file named <tt>perl_perlysense.vim</tt> and add the following:</p>

<pre>if exists( "b:perlysense" )
    finish
endif
let b:perlysense = 1

map <silent> <Leader>pp :call PerlySense_POD()<cr>
map <silent> <Leader>pg :call PerlySense_smart_go_to()<cr>

function! PerlySense_POD()
    call GetPos()
    let command="perly_sense smart_doc --file=" . b:file." --row=".b:row." --col=".b:col
    echo system(command)
endfunction

function! PerlySense_smart_go_to()
    call GetPos()
    let command="perly_sense smart_go_to --file=" . b:file." --row=".b:row." --col=".b:col
    let result = split( system(command), "\t" )
    let file = result[0]
    execute "e " . file
endfunction

function! GetPos()
    let b:file = bufname("%")
    let b:row = line(".")
    let b:col = col(".")
endfunction
</pre>

<p>Position your cursor on <tt>next</tt> and type <tt>\pp</tt> (replace the backslash with your leader character (see <tt>:help mapleader</tt> in vim) if you have a different leader character) and you should see this:</p>

<pre>found   method  name    next    docType hint
METHODS
  Instance Methods
   "next"
      my $parser = TAP::Parser->new( { source => $file } );
      while ( my $result = $parser->next ) {
          print $result->as_string, "\n";
      }

    This method returns the results of the parsing, one result at a time.
    Note that it is destructive. You can't rewind and examine previous
    results.

    If callbacks are used, they will be issued before this call returns.

    Each result returned is a subclass of TAP::Parser::Result. See that
    module and related classes for more information on how to use them.</pre>

<p>Pretty nifty, eh?  Note that this is a snippet of perldoc from a completely different file.  Perlysense just knew where to look for it.</p>

<p>Also with the above code, if you position your cursor on a package name and type <tt>\pg</tt>, vim will automatically edit the correct file.  It works, but I get strange error message about "Cannot redefine function PerlySense_smart_go_to, it is already in use".  You can eliminate by removing the "!" after <tt>function</tt>.  Makes it a bit tougher for developing this plugin, but it should work for you :)</p>

<p>PerlySense has the limitation that Perl is a dynamic language, of course, but so far it looks pretty sweet.  It also does not yet have the much of an idea of a current project and the interface is still evolving, but so far this looks like a fantastic tool to help us get IDE style integration with our editor of choice.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that there's a heck of a lot more in PerlySense than just documentation.  I'll try and post more if I get time.  Suggestions for improving my vim code welcome.  Some refactoring will be obvious as this grows, but some will simply be my not understanding vim programming terribly well.</p></p>

<h2>PerlySense vs Omnicompletion</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/markjugg/">markjugg</a> on 2008-02-04T16:43:14</h3>
This sounds a lot like Omnicompletion, which was included in Vim 7:<br><br><a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=621766" title="perlmonks.org">http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=621766</a perlmonks.org><br><br>Does PerlySense complement or compete with that approach?<br><br>(Of course, if you are stuck on machines that have older vims that aren't easily upgradeable, then PerlySense would be the way to go.)

<p>I'm really not sure.  Johan's going to be away for a bit, so I can't ask him.</p>

<p>On a related note, I've discovered that using tab completion was very painful as it would often do a full scan over everything in @INC.  I added this to my<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.vimrc and now it just scans what's in buffers (thanks to smylers for help on this):</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>set complete=.,w,b,u,t " omits ',i'. This avoids full file scans.<br> <br>function! CleverTab()<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;if strpart( getline('.'), 0, col('.')-1 ) =~ '^\s*$'<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return "\&lt;Tab&gt;"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;else<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return "\&lt;C-N&gt;"<br>endfunction<br>inoremap &lt;Tab&gt; &lt;C-R&gt;=CleverTab()&lt;CR&gt;</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>I'm sure that this could be updated for the omnicompletion.</p>

<p>Er, maybe not.  I just tried that script and can't figure out how to make it work<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(</p>

Currently PerlySense complements Onicompletion, because it doesn't do completion at all yet. Starting the project I thought that would be the killer useful feature, but it turned out to not be very high up on the list at all.<br><br>Right now, PerlySense does have a good idea of what the current class looks like (i.e. $self), but not so good idea of the environment, because there is still no @INC-wide or project-wide repository of "things".<br><br>Whenever completions is implemented, Omnicompletion could potentially start using the PerlySense backend as a provider of completions to display.<br>

<h2>Names and keys</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jplindstrom/">jplindstrom</a> on 2008-02-09T17:52:45</h3>
It's probably a good idea to try to adhere to the conventions of PerlySense a bit better, i.e. not call it "POD", but rather "Docs".<br><br>Because it isn't just POD. Docs <i>could</i> be POD, but also other things that shed light on how to use a method, like the method signature deduced from the source, or an example <i>$self-&gt;method_call($param1, $param2)</i> taken from the source. Or something else.<br><br>So the key stroke should also not be "p" for POD, but rather "g" or "G". I'll write up the conventions for key strokes/bindings, but they should be fairly obvious from reading the manual as it is.<br>
