<p>Today I tracked down a nasty bug where someone was importing these (but not using them) into a module which inherits from <tt>Class::Accessor</tt>.  This wound up inappropriately overriding the <tt>&amp;set</tt> method and it was no end of trouble trying to find this.</p>

<p>I'm trying to consider how to deal with this.  One way is to check to see if <tt>caller-&gt;can($function)</tt>, but that doesn't work if the offending function is created after <tt>Test::Most</tt> is used.  I could check this in a <tt>CHECK</tt> block, but I'm unsure if this is the best way to manage this.  There need to be other strategies here, but my primary goal is to keep this simple.</p></p>

<p>Have you consider using</p><p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; die_on_fail {<br>

<p>Actually, I've been thinking about putting a failure handler there.  I think it's a better solution:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>use Test::Most<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; tests&nbsp; &nbsp;=&gt; 3,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; on_fail =&gt; sub {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # whatever you want<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; };</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>That gives end users maximum flexibility.</p>

<p>Right now, though, I've discovered that the <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=36862" title="cpan.org">latest release, which incorporates <tt>Test::Deep</tt>, doesn't play well with <tt>Test::Class</tt><nobr> <wbr></nobr></a cpan.org>.</p>

<p>But that only gives you a global handler, with little knowledge of the test that failed.</p><p>The other suggestion is more local. And even lexical.</p>

<p>Actually, I'd be passing in the same information the current die handler gets, so you would have complete knowledge of the test which failed (well, as much as Test::Harness has).  And it would be file scoped, not global.</p>

This is one of those bits of yak shaving that Perl programmers seem to think is necessary. It always baffled me, even when I was a full fledged Perl guy, that I had to specify my plan up front. Just run the tests I give you!

<p>Plans haven't saved me a lot, but when they have, they have (particularly on ridiculously obscure occasions when tests exit prematurely but with a 0 status code. There's no reason to know anything is wrong without a plan).</p>



<h2>Re:Plans? We don't need no stinking plans!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2008-06-20T22:48:25</h3>
<p>So how do you know you didn&#8217;t run fewer tests than you meant to?</p>

<p>Yes, OK, that was easy. Now tell me how you know you didn&#8217;t run more tests than you meant to.</p>

Just how are you supposed to know how many tests you planned?
<p>Anyway... how about an end marker, "yes I'm done", a sub you call at the end of your test file. All it has to do is set a flag in the test module.</p><p><blockquote> <div><tt>done;</tt></div> </blockquote> If the tests are interrupted, it won't get called, and then you'll know, as the test module will check the status of that flag in its END block.
<p>Something like that.</p>

<p><div class="quote">What am I supposed to say to that?</div> What I was aiming as was that with the old school test modules, you have to state how many tests you plan on executing. But how can you know? Counting them manually? Running the tests, toping they all get executed, and check how many were done in the error message?
<p>That is not ideal. I'd even prefer a dry run, using ok/nok to just count the tests without actually doing them, to this. Maybe do the real test in a live run immediately after that.</p>

<p>How much confidence do you have in a test if you don't know exactly what you expect it to do?</p>

<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2008-06-23T07:34:02</h3>
<p>When you read this, the number one thing to remember is to take it with a grain of salt!  Whether or not you choose to adopt a plan depends on whether or not you feel it brings enough added value to offset your dislike of it.  If it doesn't, don't use a plan.  I'm not dogmatic<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p> <p><div class="quote">What I was aiming as was that with the old school test modules, you have to state how many tests you plan on executing. But how can you know? Counting them manually? Running the tests, toping they all get executed, and check how many were done in the error message?</div>  <p>I've been trying to understand what you were meaning by this because I <em>think</em> that there's a miscommunication here.  I could be wrong.</p>

<p>If I'm presented with a 300 line test program, you're absolutely right that I can't just <em>know</em> that it's supposed to run 113 tests.  I have to trust that the module author did the right thing.</p>

<p>That being said, if <em>I am the module author</em>, then there's no real problem.  I don't sit down and write a 300 line test program.  I write the tests incrementally and every step of the way I know what's going on.  So here are two ways that plans will save you in this scenario:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>use Test::More tests =&gt; 3;<br> <br>ok this_function();<br>ok that_function();<br>ok the_other_function();&nbsp; &nbsp;# calls exit(0) internally</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>Because the exit() gets called before the ok(), Test::More realizes we've not run enough tests.  I've had this happen before where I'm using some module from the cpan which thinks calling <tt>exit</tt> is a good idea.  Don't believe me?  Try running this on your installed modules sometime:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>ack '^\s*exit\b' lib/perl5/</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>Admittedly, many of those are false positives (documentation), but many of them are not.</p>

<p>Another way a plan can save you:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>foreach my $attr ( $inspect-&gt;attributes($foo) ) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; can_ok $foo, $attr;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; lives_ok { $foo-&gt;$attr } "... and we should be able to call '$attr'";<br>}</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>Now what happens if someone adds an attribute and forgets to update the plan?  Some people say "yeah, just assert the number of attributes first".  There's nothing wrong with that approach, but that means I <em>always</em> have to remember to do that when I have  potentially varying number of tests.  Or I can always assert a plan and never have to worry about it.</p>

There error message is, of course, the info of Test::* complaining about "It looks like you planned to run 20 tests, but you actually ran 23" so you can fix the plan number to 23.<p><div class="quote">Or I can always assert a plan and never have to worry about it.</div> My problem is that when I'm writing tests for a module, I may be adding a test every few minutes and I always have to update the plan. And that is an annoying chore. I constantly have to worry about it.

That's clever! And it is possible because <code>plan</code> is a runtime function call, instead of the usual parameter to the <code>use</code> statement.
<p>I must say, that <code>plan</code> is well hidden in the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test%3A%3AMore" title="cpan.org">docs</a cpan.org>. It doesn't even get its own entry in the module's list of functions.</p>

<h2>Test::Deep's &quot;kinda&quot; bugs with default exports</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/kappa/">kappa</a> on 2008-06-21T21:51:33</h3>
See Test::Deep in rt.cpan.org. Incompatible isa() and blessed() functions lead to very hard to catch bugs.



<h2>AUTOLOAD</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/AndyArmstrong/">AndyArmstrong</a> on 2008-06-22T16:06:08</h3>
Instead of exporting all those subs you could export an AUTOLOAD into main and have that import them on demand<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
