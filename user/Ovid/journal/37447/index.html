<h1>Github?</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2008-09-15T08:01:18</h2>
</div> <!-- /span4 -->


<div class="span8">
<p><p>I've been thinking more and more about opening up all of my code.  I was tempted to put it on Google Code, but the more I think about it, the more I want <a href="http://github.com/">Git Hub</a> or something similar.  There are two reasons for this.  First, even if I never used the advanced features of git, I find that it has so many little details that are "just right", that I'm comfortable with it.  Git's responsiveness and lack of a central server are also huge plusses for me.</p>

<P>The main reason, though, is that I suspect I'll have a better quality of developer submitting patches and work if I use git.  I can't prove this, but the sort of developer who says "cvs is good enough for me" and then makes commits without a commit message just isn't the sort of developer I feel comfortable with.  They might be a great developer, but usually when I've encountered this type, they have quite a lot to learn.</p>

<P>I realize that this might sound terribly elitist of me and I suppose it is.  It's also worth pointing out that I might be trying to pre-emptively solve a non-existent problem.  I rarely get patches now and when I do, they're usually of high quality.  However, I suspect that's because the sort of people who are willing to take the trouble submit those patches are the sorts of people who already care about their craft.</p></p>

<h2>Elitist?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/polettix/">polettix</a> on 2008-09-15T10:01:53</h3>
<p>I don't think that setting rules for other to participate on your projects is being elitist - you should keep the joy of working on them. As the "founder", IMHO you deserve any right to set the standards, either explicitly or - as in this case - implicitly.</p>



<h2>Github is good</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/amoore/">amoore</a> on 2008-09-15T13:48:05</h3>
I think a service like GitHub is pretty useful for module authors. In fact, I've often thought that a few tools that relate CPAN to github (or another similar one) could solve the occasional "svn (or other repository tool) for all CPAN modules or authors" plan that arises.<br/><br/>I say go for it.



<h2>I enjoy it so far.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jk2addict/">jk2addict</a> on 2008-09-15T15:15:55</h3>
<p>About 2 weeks ago, I started the process of moving all of the crap out of my basement and out into shared hosting world. I started with moving my local svn projects to GitHub.</p><p>It's free. Someone else backs it up, and I don't have to worry about mine crashing. Win win. I happen to also like the GitHub interface better.</p>



<h2>My git transition</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2008-09-15T18:18:06</h3>
<p>A lot of good developers use git, but I don't think using Git makes you a good developer.</p><p>In my experience the good people submit patches no matter what source control I'm using.</p><p>Still, I'm really enjoying git now that I've gotten over the hump of learning the basics. It took a little while to get used to, but that I'm easily managing several branches at the same time on some projects, I'm happy with git.</p><p>I have a <a href="http://github.com/briandfoy/github_creator/tree/master" title="github.com">github_creator script</a github.com> on Github. I make my repositories locally and set up github as a remote (not origin). I just run the script in a working copy and it automatically creates the git repo, sets up the remote, and pushes to it. I also replicate my git stuff in a few different places so I don't rely on someone else's service:</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>#!/usr/bin/perl<br>use warnings;<br>use strict;<br>

I've just moved my modules over there.  It works a treat.
