<p><p>Recently, I posted on Perlmonks <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=204342">a list of concerns about SQL Ledger</a>.  Someone took exception to this and posted to the SQL Ledger mailing list that I had done a "shabby" review.  I replied to the author and to the list (of which I am not a member) and pointed out that this was not a code review, but a summary of the salient points of an internal review that I had done at our company.  As such, it was not appropriate to view my conclusions and conclude that my methodology was "shabby".</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, my post to the SQL Ledger mailing list was rejected.  I would have understood if my post had been rejected because I was not a member of the list.  However, that was not the reason given to me.  From the rejection email:</p>

<blockquote><em>You should learn some people skills first before you go out trashing.  Then you whine about being not treated fairly. Give me a break. Read what you wrote. And, yes, the code snippet you posted gave you away.</em></blockquote>

<p>A couple of years ago, I was taken to task by a <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=21576">very rude book review that I posted</a>.  I was flat out wrong in the tone that I took and I have striven be less offensive in the way that I write and I think that I was fair in my comments regarding SQL Ledger.  Nonetheless, I have extended an offer to the administrator of the SQL Ledger mailing list.  If they wish to provide a rebuttal or correction to any or all of my comments, I will be happy to post said rebuttal or correction at Perlmonks.  If I'm wrong in my assessment of their code, I'll cheerfully provide a soapbox for them and take my lumps.</p>

<p>I have to admit, I am very curious to see what, if anything, they have to say.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>  No, I haven't seen a reply from them yet, but I decided to sign up for the <a href="http://www.sql-ledger.com/misc/mailinglist.html">SQL Ledger users mailing list</a>.  A couple of hours later, I received my welcome email and started getting list traffic.  What's interesting is that I did <em>not</em> receive a confirmation email.  I just entered an email address and subscribed.  Hmm ... I wonder who else I could subscribe.  I wonder if Bill Gates wants to get SQL Ledger email? ;)</p></p>
