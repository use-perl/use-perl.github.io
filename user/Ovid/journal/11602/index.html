<p><p>I have been working too much, not getting enough sleep and I'm cranky as heck because it's my seventh day without smoking.  I just posted a long question on Perlmonks that I had asked a month earlier.  I'm am soooo looking forward to the weekend and gobs of sleep.</p></p>

<p>IIRC, at this point the nicotine should be gone from your body, so you're coping with psychological rather than physical withdrawal symptoms.  Drink lots of water and hang in there.</p>

<p>The nicotine isn't gone.  I'm using the Patch, but I guess that means it's still the the psychological aspect.  I've also discovered that placement of the patch is very important.  If I place it too close to my heart, it races.  I also placed it on my stomach on my left side and periodically develop sharp pains in the major leg artery on my left side.  If I keep the Patch on my arms, I don't seem to have a problem.</p>

That doesn't make them any less powerful, unfortunately. At least you can scrub your body clean of the physical aspects.

I've had problems when trying patches - with effects similar to those you describe. This time I'm trying the mints that you dissolve slowly in your mouth - with better results, I think because I'm more in control of the dosage. My only current issue is weight gain.... But yes, hang on in there - it can only get easier.
