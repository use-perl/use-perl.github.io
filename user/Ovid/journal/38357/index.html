<p>As two people on <a href="http://twitter.com/OvidPerl" title="twitter.com">my Twitter feed</a twitter.com> have sadly reminded me, "pro-life" means "not yet born".  After that, let 'em eat cake (with apologies to the misunderstood Marie Antionette).</p>

This reminds me of something George Carlin said about "pro-life" people. How much they care for the unborn, "but once you're born you're fucked". Seems suitable here...

<p>I realize that Mother Teresa wasn't American, but she did offer to find a home for every child who would otherwise have been aborted (see <a href="http://www.c-spanarchives.org/congress/?q=node/77531&amp;id=6775042" title="c-spanarchives.org">IN MEMORY OF MOTHER TERESA</a c-spanarchives.org> from the Congressional Record; this is the best authority I've found for this quote).</p>

Yes, because anyone who is pro-life must be a religious fanatic. Jeez.

<p>If pro-choice -&gt; abortion == murder, how much prison time should the mother get?</p><p>They never answer that one.</p>

<h2>Re:I like the other argument better</h2>

<p>That makes the assumption that all people who are against abortion equate it to murder. I think you're generalizing the beliefs of those who are screaming and waving protest signs to the other people who believe abortion is wrong.</p>

<p>I did generalize for the sake of that post.</p><p>Personally, I believe in pro-choice and pro-life. I wouldn't choose abortion, but I wouldn't force that choise on others.</p><p>Or more to the point, I believe that the government and any other group should stay the hell out of it completely as it's a personal matter.</p>

In the abstract I like the idea that one shouldn't force a choice on another. But as applied to abortion it is curious that the parent gets a choice, but the child in the womb doesn't get a choice when her mother decides to kill her.

<h2>that's a little unfair</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mpeters/">mpeters</a> on 2009-01-28T14:47:03</h3>
<p>Which ever side you are on in the debate, it should be obvious to see a difference in something that is a choice and something that isn't.</p><p>Nobody chooses to have a high infant mortality rate (yes it could be prevented, but that's not the same as choosing to have it). Some people do chose to have an abortion.</p>



<h2>on the mortality rate...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dagolden/">dagolden</a> on 2009-01-28T15:00:00</h3>
<p>Just food for thought on the other side of the question -- I've never seen good analysis of broader explanatory factors for high infant mortality rate.  I would be curious abou such things as older average age of mothers, higher rate of multiples due to IVF, higher maternal obesity rates, etc -- all of which I could imagine being the case for the US and which could increase risk of infant mortality.</p><p>

<p>Actually, there's lots of information out there regarding the reasons for the infant mortality rate in the US.  A quick google should return plenty of results to follow for original information.</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:on the mortality rate...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rurban/">rurban</a> on 2009-01-28T23:45:58</h3>
<p>Sure. Because of the obscenely low social standards in the US.</p><p>No standard health care access, female education, armed conflicts and "cultural practices". (just citing the CNN report)</p>

<h2>Measured differently</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2009-01-28T16:43:51</h3>
<p>I've heard the mortality rates are measured differently.</p><p>Then again, my wife and I intentionally make unorthodox birth choices, such as having three children at home (twins, once) attended by a midwife, instead of at a hospital attended by an OB.  We're aware that there are issues with the current birth system available in America.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p><p>Of course, we don't believe government action can fix it.  We believe government action caused it.</p><p>We believe something similar about abortion, which is starting to make us look "pro-choice," even though we think abortion is unequivocally the taking of the life of a human being.</p>

<h2>Re:Measured differently</h2>

<p>We did the same (except with 4).<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>I believe that abortion is the taking of the life of a human being. I also believe that abortion will never go away. Given that, I hope and fight for a system where there the least amount of abortions necessary are performed.</p>
