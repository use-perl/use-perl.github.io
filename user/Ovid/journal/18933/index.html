<p><p>A friend's boyfriend downloaded some software and a crook used the spyware it installed to steal my friend's Paypal information.  He cleaned out her account buying gaming supplies, of all things.  Paypal shut down her account (apparently, people can keep sending money but they won't give it to her -- that sounds like theft to me.) and the police won't do anything because the criminal is probably smarter than they are (their words, not mine.)</p>

<p>Well, crap.  A friend gets robbed, the police do nothing, her account gets frozen and she has no idea what she can do.  We've a lot of adjusting to do before we can make this new system work.</p></p>

<h2>Use a credit card</h2>

<p>I have grown to distrust PayPal even though I have not had any bad happen to me yet.  The terms keep changing (every 4 - 6 weeks it would seem).</p>
<p>I prefer to use a credit card.  I've even used <a href="http://www.ecount.com/" title="ecount.com">eCount</a ecount.com> to accept credit card payments.  (I'm not saying that they are the best, just that they were the only game in town at the time that I could afford.  Read: they don't charge much.)</p>



<h2>people suck</h2>

If people are stupid enough to install spyware - or let someone else install it, of course, or use a computer adminned by a retard for anything confidential - they deserve everything they get.
