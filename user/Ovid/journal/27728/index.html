<p><p>Once again I'm searching for a common utility module that I assume is out there.  For example, <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=510050">I recently asked about deleting subroutines</a> from globs.  The problem here is that you can't really do it without deleting the entire glob.  What needs to be done is to copy the glob slots <em>except</em> for the CODE slot, delete the glob, then add back the other slots.  This seems like silly make-work.  I'd expect there to be a module which properly abstracts this for me:</p>

<pre>package Some::Package;
use Symbol::Glob;
# assumes current package unless specified
my $glob = Symbol::Glob->new({ name => 'foo' });

$glob->scalar(14);
$glob->sub( sub { return 'this is a sub' });
print $Some::Package::foo; # prints 14

$glob->delete('scalar');
print $Some::Package::foo; # undefined
print $glob->sub->();      # prints 'this is a sub'

$glob->delete;             # removes entire glob</pre>

<p>Is there something that straightforward on the CPAN?  I'm not seeing it.</p></p>

I have not investigated whether it does what you want, but it's in the ballpark.<br><br>Now, back to turkey.

I decided to go ahead and write this, because I'm doing a fair amount of glob munging in WWW::Mechanize::Pluggable, and it'd be nice to have it better encapsulated. It does what you asked it to do in your example, and it's available on CPAN.<br><br>As a nice bonus, I got a chance to try the inside-out object model and Class::Std. Found it much easier to concentrate on getting the details of the glob manipulation right because I knew that the object access code was safe.<br><br>I did find one thing I needed to do that wasn't simple with Class::Std. As you noted, removing a symbol table entry safely consists of deleting the glob altogether, then inserting the fields you want to keep back into the glob again. A Class::Std class doesn't let you iterate over all of the fields in the object easily, because they aren't *in* the object. I ended up creating a mapping hash that mapped method names to the storage hashes to be able to find them all easily.
