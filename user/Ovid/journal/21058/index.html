<h1>Running Squeak</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>It's been a frustrating day trying to get <a href="http://squeak.org/">Squeak</a> up and running.  One site had archives that I couldn't unpack.  Another one had an "all in one" bundle that was a piece of cake to install.  Unfortunately, I have to run <em>inisqueak</em> to create my image and it didn't seem to include that.  After a bit of playing around, I created a <tt>$HOME/.squeak</tt> directory, copied Squeak3.7-5989-full.changes,  Squeak3.7-5989-full.image and SqueakV3.sources over there, set my SQUEAK_IMAGE environment variable to point to an image file there and successfully ran Squeak.  The main window has a variety of different screenshots(?) that I can zoom into and play with and some information that  will probably prove useful, though it's a bit of a strange world for me.</p>

<p>It appears that to actually get to write code, I need to expand the System Browser window but Squeak is not automatically opening to that right away.  I think that's right, but I'm not sure.  I don't know if the image file I copied to the .squeak directory is not the one I wanted.  I hover the mouse over various "things" and not all of them have tools tips.</p>

<p>After a bit of playing around and reading through a <a href="http://squeak.org/tutorials/cphoenix_tutorial/intro.html">Squeak tutorial</a>, I created various tiny methods and one of them looked like this:</p>

<pre>hello: times say: text
	(times > 100) 
		ifTrue: [ Transcript show: 'You will get bored!']
		ifFalse: [1 to: times do: [:i | (Transcript show: text) cr]]</pre>

<p>Which can be invoked as:</p>

<pre>Object new hello: 5 say: 'This is cool'</pre>

<p>I now think I understand the lack of <tt>if</tt> statements (I'm sure my terminology is off.)  The <tt>(times > 100)</tt> expression constructs a boolean objects which understands the message <tt>ifTrue:ifFalse:</tt>.  Since everything is an object and you send messages to them, a bare <tt>if</tt> hanging out there would not fit the language design.</p>

<p>So how does the loop work?  The number 1 (one) creates an integer object which understands the <tt>to:do:</tt> message.  This is very cool, but I'll admit that it's a bit strange to me.  I look forward to more play, but tuit reclamation is proceeding, as always, slowly.</p></p>

Sometimes during a Perl class, I like to jerk the chains of the Java people who like to play OO-purist.<br> <br>I ask them "What methods can you call on 1?".  They look at me dumbly for a bit.  Sometimes they say something about creating a new object, and I have to reinforce the statement: "No, all you get is 1.  What methods can you call on it?"<br> <br>It ends up the same: "I guess Java isn't an object oriented language then."

<p>That's a classic example of people misunderstanding the terminology.  Even my brief exposure to Squeak is showing me more.  While I'm unsure of the process by which <tt>(foo &gt; 5)</tt> creates a Boolean object in Squeak, it's now clear how the <tt>ifTrue:ifFalse</tt> messages work and why the traditional if/else statements are procedural in nature.  It's <em>not</em> clear to me if mixing a bit of procedural code with OO code is bad, but then, I'm still exploring this.  I suspect that the pure OO approach has benefits that get around <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=392248" title="perlmonks.org">some complaints I have about inappropriate uses of "if"</a perlmonks.org>.  I doubt one constructs long strings of if/else statements (or their equivalent) in Squeak.</p>

The object to which methods are sent is <i>always</i> the left one.  There are no prefix operators.  Everything is left to right.  So, in<blockquote><div> <tt>foo &gt; 5</tt> </div></blockquote>you'd look for a greather-than binary message in the class (and superclasses) of value currently held in the <tt>foo</tt> variable.  If it was:<blockquote><div> <tt>5 &lt; foo</tt> </div></blockquote>you'd look for a less-than binary message in the class of <tt>5</tt> and its superclasses.  Yes, a wacked-out system could make those do different things, but "with great power comes great responsibility".

Now I am wanting to test the Smalltalk waters!  Thanks guys.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>So that's where Objective C...</h2>

gets the method calling syntax! It took me a while to wrap my head around it, but it's kind of useful because it helps from having a long, incongruous list of positional parameters.
