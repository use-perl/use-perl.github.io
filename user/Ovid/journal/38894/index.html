<p><p>So Child inherits from Parent.  Parent used some roles but, unbeknownst to me, Parent implemented some methods the roles provided, effectively hiding them.  Naturally, since this is silent, I had no idea this was happening.  Yesterday, in preparing to eliminate this base class, I moved those roles to the classes which actually use them.  Role composition failed and I blew another large chunk of time trying to figure out what happened.  It was a perfect storm of several bits of code working together in <em>exactly</em> the way they needed to in order to sidestep a bug.  Blind luck that it had worked previously.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it turns out that the hidden methods were effectively no-ops and this lack of activity was hidden by our class hierarchy and simply deleting them was enough to get the code working.  Otherwise, I was facing a long battle trying to figure out the right thing to do.  This little time bomb has been silently hiding under the covers for a few months now.</P>

<p>The moral of this story:  if you must use inheritance, push your roles into your concrete classes, if possible, to gain the benefits of composition conflict checks.</p></p>
