<h1>Finding Unused Files</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><P>In part of a code cleanup, we are going to eliminate unused files in a standard Perl/CGI app which has been around for 7 to 10 years.  With thousands of files, my first thought was something like this hack:</p>

<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl 

use strict;
use warnings;

my @files =  map  { s{^\./}{}; $_ }
    `find . -type f | grep -v CVS`;

chomp(@files);

my $count = @files;
my $curr  = 1;

foreach my $file (@files) {
    print "Processing $file.  $curr out of $count.\n";
    $curr++;
    my $no_ext = $file;
    $no_ext =~ s{^.*?([^./]+)(?:\.\w+)?$}{$1};

    # Find all files | Exclude this file from list | find files which
    # reference it
    my $command = "find . -type f |grep -Ev '$file|text_r5_c2'|xargs grep -l '$no_ext'";
    unless ( `$command` ) {
        warn $file,$/;
    }
}</pre>

<p>It's pretty ugly and *nix specific, but the basic idea is this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find all files</li>
  <li>Foreach file, find all files <em>not</em> matching that file name</li>
  <li>For remaining files, if no file match the bare filename (without path or extension), then we have an orphan file</li>
</ol>

<p>It seemed reasonable, but ignoring the fact that it's very slow, the obvious problem kicked in:  if you have an entire section of code no longer being used, it can be a self-referential section and therefore is unlikely to show up on this list.  This app doesn't have a robust enough test suite to figure this out. Time for another strategy.</p>

<p>A coworker suggested grepping the access logs.  Now I feel <em>really</em> stupid since this is so obvious.  If a file shows up in there, we know we probably want to keep it.  If it doesn't, it merits further investigation.</p></p>

If it's a linux box, there's probably a chance you can put the atime values to use for once.<br>

<p>Thought about that, but there are problems there.  First, they completely fail if anyone's been just perusing the code in vim, yes?  (I've been doing a lot of that learning the code base).  Also, robots such as Googlebot might access old files which haven't been linked to in a while.  Of course, I'm not much of an administrator, so if I'm wrong, let me know!</p>
