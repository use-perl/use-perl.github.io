<p><p>Want fame and fortune?  Have more tuits than I do?  Integrate Perl and Javascript tests.  Here's how.</p>

<p>I'm writing Javascript tests for Bricolage 2.0 and realize I have a huge problem.  The JS tests are run through a HTML document that passes a form object to a class:</p>

<pre>JSAN.use('Test.More');
JSAN.includePath = ['../../../www/js'];
JSAN.use('Kinetic.Search');

var search_form = document.search_form;
var url         = new Kinetic.Search().buildURL(search_form);
var expected    = 'http://www.example.com/some/url';
is(url, expected, 'search_form should return the correct URL');</pre>

<p>Now this is all well and good, but there's a serious problem here.  The search forms are generated dynamically.  I'm about to change how they work but I really don't want to have to keep remembering to update the form in my tests.  It dawned on me that I could get around this by using <tt>HTTP::Server::Simple</tt> to generate forms and have the Javascript tests run against those.  Thus, they're always running against real Perl code.  I understand that Apache test may come close, but I don't know if it can run the Javascript tests.</p>

<p>Since I'd already be running a simple server, why not have the server run the real Perl test suite and pass those results to the Javascript <tt>Test.Builder</tt>?  By running one server, I could run my Javascript and Perl tests at the same time.  Cunning, eh?</p>

<p>Now if only I had the time to indulge in this ...</p>

<p>I'm sure you'd win many admirers if you have more time for this than I do :)</p>

<p>In fact, if you set it up so it can collect any valid TAP results, we could integrate just about any programming language tests with JavaScript.  I don't know if this has ever been done before.</p></p>

Could you use something like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/claesjac/JavaScript-0.55/JavaScript.pod" title="cpan.org">JavaScript</a cpan.org> or <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/mschilli/JavaScript-SpiderMonkey-0.11/" title="cpan.org">JavaScript::SpiderMonkey</a cpan.org> to get the JS tests run?  Then you could pass in the form results directly.

<p>That has the downside of locking me into a particular JS engine.  By doing it from the browser, I can use any browser I want and be sure that it's being tested appropriately.</p>

<p>Spidermonkey was briefly discussed with my boss yesterday.  He pointed out that he doesn't know anyone who's successfully compiled it.  That's a bit of an obstacle<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

It's in the FreeBSD ports, how hard can it be?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Talks about testing javascript cross-platform via a perlbal server, and it seems related enough that you might be interested.
