<p><p>Mom called.</p>

<tt>
Me: &nbsp;Mpgh, glmp, gulp.  Hi mom.<br>
Mom: Did I catch you during dinner?<br>
Me: &nbsp;Yup.<br>
Mom: What are you eating?<br>
Me: &nbsp;Fried chicken.<br>
Mom: Don't you know that fried foods are bad for you?  They<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clog your arteries and you'll have a heart attack!<br>
Me: &nbsp;It's your recipe, mom.<br>
Mom: Oh...
</tt>

<p>The other night, after pool (which I lost...grrr - we went from a contender to last in Portland!), I went out dancing.  This particular dance club has a front section where androgynous performers lip synch well-known songs.  It was rather interesting watching a cross-dressing midget sing "Du hast mich", by Rammstein.</p>

<p>In other news, the last Portland Perl Mongers meeting was good.  Tom Phoenix gave a presentation on sorting, but the attendance was rather poor.  That's my fault.  With all of the personal stuff going on in my life, I did a rotten job organizing things.  That being said, if anyone is in the Portland, Oregon, USA area, let me know if you'd like to attend a meeting or give a presentation.  The last part seems to be the most difficult part of the organization.  Everyone wants to listen, no one wants to talk.</p></p>
