<p><p>2002 will definitely go down as the year that Ovid had bad money karma.  I have a good job, pay my bills and have money to spare.  The Money Gods, however, have confused me for Job and decided to see what trials I will willingly endure before I blaspheme them.</p>

<p>Okay, I give.  I'm no Job and I'm blaspheming the nasty f***ers right now!  Oregon wants to force me to <a href="/user/Ovid/journal/6164">pay taxes that I have already paid</a>.  My phone company was trying to <a href="/user/Ovid/journal/6674">charge me for someone else's broadband service</a> (and later apologized for the screwup and then sent me to collections).  Today, I get a nasty call from one of my credit card companies.  Why didn't I pay my bill?</p>

<p>What bill?  They were bought out by another company and I called in September trying to find out who to pay.  I was told <em>not</em> to pay because I would get my new credit card on or about October 2nd.  I never received the card.  I never received a statement.  I did, however, get informed that my late payment would likely be reported to the credit bureaus (in addition to a late fee they were slapping on me).  After discovering that they had my address incorrect, I pointed out that I have never missed or been late on any of my payments.  Penalizing me for a clerical error on their part was ridiculous.</p>

<p>Once they realized what happened, they were terribly apologetic, said they would reverse the late fee -- pending receipt of payment, and if I <em>did</em> get reported to a credit bureau, just write a nice letter to my bank and they'll take care of it.  What??  They screw up my account and I'm the one who must jump through hoops to clear it?  And will it take care of the problem?  I've already had Qwest put me through a meat grinder while smiling and telling me how sorry they were about it.  I'm a bit skeptical at this point.</p>

<p>And to add to the fun, Shirley ******, the lady who had the broadband service that I was getting billed for, apparently skipped out on her Ford Motor Credit loan, too.  I should know.  I've just started receiving nasty phone calls from their collections department.</p></p>
