<p><p>I'm sure someone has brought this up before, but I happened to notice the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI-Builder/">CGI::Builder</a> module on the CPAN.  It has more 5 star ratings than test passes.  In fact, <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/dist/CGI-Builder">every rating is five stars and they're glowing reviews</a>.  And all reviewers are people I've never heard of.  Then, to finish this off, I checked their other reviews and every review that all of them have written seems to be a glowing review of software that the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/domizio/">CGI::Builder author</a> has written.</p>

<p>So yeah, I blow my own horn at times, but at least I'm honest about it.</p>

<p>(For added fun, read the guy's code -- though <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=349737">this issue is well-known</a>)</p></p>

<p>
I think that some of the 5 star ratings were a reaction of merlyn's 1 star ratings (now removed) over the phone-home issue.

See <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/ethan/journal/19778" title="perl.org">here</a perl.org> for an earlier discussion of this.

<p>It is an obvious "copy" of CGI::Application. I wonder what the user base size compared to C::A it has? I have heard nothing about it.</p>

<p>Quite honestly, if I have to think too hard when I read code, I will move on. Those weirdly placed semi-colons make my nose bleed.</p>

ahhhhhh. I think I have seen that style before. Maybe it was from the same author. How could one possibly find that readable? It looks like he starts every line with a semi colon, so that he cannot forget them. Thinking about it, he probably should be using python instead.

I think that is exactly what he is doing. I think the CPAN gods should lightning bolt him. lol

It started out as a reimplementation of CGI::Application. I still faintly remember the turmoil he caused on the cgiapp mailing list too. See <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/cgiapp@lists.erlbaum.net/msg01291.html" title="mail-archive.com">http://www.mail-archive.com/cgiapp@lists.erlbaum.net/msg01291.html</a mail-archive.com> and further down the thread.<br>
