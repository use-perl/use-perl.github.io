<p><p>If you know me, you know that I'm not much of a gamer.  I have played them from time to time, but I really don't get into them.  I enjoyed the Thief series quite a bit as that appealed to me, but other than that, I play a game and very quickly get bored.  That's why I don't "get" why people are so enamored of World of Warcraft (WoW).  Well, until now.  Blame Schwern.</p>

<p>I'm "Corinnanaso" on "Twisting Nether".  Useless bonus points if you know how I picked that user name.</p>

<p>One thing I thought was interesting was the opening cinematics.  Needless to say, while they're very well done, the actual game graphics can't hold a candle to them.  However, in 10 or 15 years, the opening cinematics will <em>be</em> the game graphics.</p></p>

You fool! You foolish fool!<br><br>That's what you get for not investing in a self-limiting game, like Allegiance or single player $something.

<p>I'm Alliance.  Figured since I've never done this before, I might as well be one of the good guys (even if I am a rogue).</p>

<h2>Scripts</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/luqui/">luqui</a> on 2006-01-25T09:57:26</h3>
Though I don't play WoW myself, I have some friends who are addicts.  I was impressed by its scriptability.  Blizzard chose Lua, which is designed for embedded scripting, instead of half-baking their own crappy language like everybody else (where "everybody else" in the game market is... well, basically nobody).

<p>I don&#8217;t think so. We heard that 10 or 15 years ago as well. And by the standards of the time, today&#8217;s game graphics could be cinematics &#8211; but the quality of cinematics has not stood still in that time, so today&#8217;s game graphics cannot hold a candle to the opening cinematics any more than they could 15 years ago.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;ll be a while before the quality of cinematics tops out and the game graphics get a chance to close in.</p>

<p>In other notes: my condolences about your free time.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt> </p>

<p>I wasn't meaning the the graphics of the game would match what we see in cinema.  I was meaning that the graphics we see in games will match the the opening graphics that we see on WoW today.</p>

<p>What I thought you meant was that in-game graphics would match the game&#8217;s intro sequence graphics; not that the graphics would match cinema.</p>
