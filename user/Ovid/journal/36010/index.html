<h1>No Test::RelaxNG?</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>I can't believe there's no <tt>Test::RelaxNG</tt> or similar on the CPAN.  On the other hand, I can't believe there's no <tt>Test::YAML</tt> out there, either.  Oh, wait, there <em>is</em> is <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/ingy/YAML-0.66/lib/Test/YAML.pm">Test::YAML</a>, but it not only doesn't do anything particularly useful (that I can tell), it also relies on Spiffy.  Jonathan Rockway has <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-YAML-Valid/">Test::YAML::Valid</a>, but it only tests that YAML is valid (well, duh :).  It doesn't let me test whether or not the YAML contents are correct.  Of course, this is why I wrote <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-JSON/">Test::JSON</a>, a module which I was astonished hadn't already existed.</p>

<p>Someone (hint, hint!), really needs to take XML, JSON, and YAML and create one giant <tt>Test::SomeCleverName</tt> module which lets people bundle all of those needs together.</p>

<p>For the curious, here's a rather naive implementation of Test::RelaxNG that I just wrote:</p>

<pre>package Bermuda::Data::Test;

use strict;
use warnings;

use Test::Builder;
use XML::LibXML;
use base 'Exporter';
our @EXPORT = 'is_valid_against_rng';

my $TEST = Test::Builder->new;

sub is_valid_against_rng ($$;$) {
    my ( $xml, $schema, $name ) = @_;
    $name ||= 'XML validates against RNG';

    my $parser = XML::LibXML->new;
    my $rng    = XML::LibXML::RelaxNG->new( string => $schema );

    eval {
        $rng->validate($parser->parse_string($xml));
    };

    if ( my $error = $@ ) {
        $TEST->ok( 0, $name );
        $TEST->diag($error);
        return;
    }
    else {
        $TEST->ok( 1, $name );
        return 1;
    }
}

1;</pre></p>

<p>This plants seeds of interesting ideas into my brain. I see that <tt>Test::XML</tt> exists but seems to be abandoned. Now I must go take some notes before I forget these things...</p>

<p>I was about to say that it's not abandoned as the author recently accepted a patch from me, but then I noticed that the patch was sent in 2005.</p>

<p>Yeah, I've had some moments like that... (like realizing how long it's been since my book came out)</p>

<h2>Cross cutting concern</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nothingmuch/">nothingmuch</a> on 2008-04-02T16:26:04</h3>
Test::RelaxNG and Test::YAML (the hypothetical one) are in different categories IMHO.<br/><br/>RelaxNG is XML specific validation<br/><br/>YAML, otoh, is just a format<br/><br/>Validating the data (not the serialization of the data) seems to be what you care about, so why not just use Test::Deep? It's complete, robust, well tested, featureful...<br/><br/>I don't see why a data validation test suite has to be redone for every serliazation format out there.<br/><br/>In fact, I'd much rather see RelaxNG validation become applicable to non XML formats whenever possible, for instance any object tree that implements Tree::XPathEngine, instead of being tied to the plain text format that is XML.<br/><br/>I think that Test::JSON, Test::YAML etc should actually converge on to something more Test::YAML::Valid like, leaving the data validation to something less encumbered with formats.<br/><br/>It's also more informative to fail the "badly formatted" test separately from the "failed validation" test.



<h2>Seed Planted</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rjray/">rjray</a> on 2008-04-03T07:17:34</h3>
<p>I am actively working on this now. Keep an eye to CPAN for something in the next 2-4 days. Still trying to think of a good base namespace that applies equally to XML, JSON and YAML.</p>
<p>I'm tempted to call it <tt>Test::Markup</tt> with the full knowledge that the use of the word "Markup" will wind up the YAML guys.</p>



<h2>Great work</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2008-04-03T07:22:00</h3>
<p>Woot!  Ask and thou shalt receive.  Thanks<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
