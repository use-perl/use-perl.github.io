<p><p>So Microsoft was going to end support for Windows 98.  This seems rather reasonable, given the speed with which software evolves (and given that MS is a commercial operation).  What I feel stupid about is not realizing the implications.  I saw the story, shrugged, and moved on.  Since I'm running Linux at home, it's a non-issue for me.</p>

<p>So who was Microsoft ending support for?  A bunch of people running an old OS who, for whatever reason, hadn't chosen to upgrade.  Many of those people might just be wanting to save some money.  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/home/howtobuy/pricing.asp">The baseline price for them, if they upgrade, is $99.00</a>.  Of course, then they might start thinking about office productivity software, new anti-virus software, more security patches, etc.  Sticking with Microsoft can involve quite a bit of out-of-pocket expenses.  If you work for a non-profit organization, this could give you pause.  And when MS forces your hand by discontinuing support, that pause might make you contemplate a Penguin.</p>

<p>Microsoft realizes this, too, which is why they <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/34938.html">have decided to continue supporting Windows 98 for the time being</a>.  It really bugs me that something so bloody obvious just completely escaped my attention, but then, I had to read "Good Omens", <em>twice</em> before I realized that Adam and his gang were the childhood equivalents of the Four Horsemen, even though it's spelled out pretty clearly at the end when each child fights his or her counterpart.  I'm kinda slow that way, sometimes.</p></p>
