<p><p>So we're talking about Perl and he asks "how do I read a file, change it, and write it back out again?  Do I have to close and reopen it?"</p>

<p>There are many different ways to do this and the best choice depends upon what you need to do, who else might be using the file, the size of the file, etc.  Since many of his questions are standard questions I suggested he pick up a copy of the Perl Cookbook.</p>

<p>I then backpedalled (sp?) furiously.  The <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perlckbk2/">Second Edition</a> of the book should be out in August.  I'll just loan him an extra copy and, in the meantime, drool in anticipation at the thought of the second one.</p>

<p>Excuse me now.  I have to go wipe the saliva off my chin.</p></p>

<h2>Bytes or lines</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2003-07-17T17:03:04</h3>
<p>In general, if your file is line-based, you are probably best off using Tie::File; if you need to change characters (bytes) at a specific location in the file, then you probably want to use things like seek, tell, and the update file open option.</p>

<p>I put this here not because Ovid doesn't know it, but in case anyone was reading and wondering.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)  There are many other solutions, and it definitely depends on a lot of factors.</p>

<p>I was hoping you'd have him buy two copies<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>Second edition should be out in September, assuming we survive QC1.  I have the first 17 chapters, and it's already 746 pages long.  TOO<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... MUCH<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... PERL!</p>

I wait with great anticipation for the second edition of the Ram.  (What I'd really like to see someday is a Complete Perl Bookshelf, up-to-date editions of every book that's been on one of the Shelves.  Wouldn't even need a physical copy of the Nutshell, because this would be an item for people who presumably owned a copy of it already.  I suspect it's not even close to feasible, but I figured I'd ask while I'm here.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  )

I meant the CD-ROM, of course...</p>
