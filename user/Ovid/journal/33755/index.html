<h1>Test::Database to the CPAN?</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2007-07-09T09:46:33</h2>
</div> <!-- /span4 -->


<div class="span8">
<p><P>Here's something I've written for work and it's been extremely useful:</p>

<pre>use Test::Database;
my $database = Test::Database->new;
my $dbh      = $database->dbh;
$database->load_static_data;</pre>

<p>What this does is read a config file which provides connection information for a database and the first thing it does is build a brand new test database.  Internally, it instantiates a <tt>$dbh</tt> and loads a schema file, using Template Toolkit.  The beginning of the file looks something like this:</p>

<pre>DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS `[% database %]`;
CREATE DATABASE `[% database %]`;
use `[% database %]`;

CREATE TABLE `accounts` (
...</pre>

<p>The <tt>load_static_data()</tt> method reads another SQL file which adds the static (non-changing) data to the database.  This, of course, is optional and that's why it's a separate command.  Then you can use your test database all you like.  Further, when <tt>$database</tt> goes out of scope, the database is dropped -- but only if it's the parent process.  Forking children and having them drop the database is disappointing.</p>

<p>Also, because you can specify your own test database name, every developer can easily use database tests and not worry about clashing with someone else.</p>

<p>It needs work.  Specifically, it needs to not be *nix specific or MySQL specific.  I'm thinking that the easiest thing to do would be to make it a base class and provide instructions on how to override certain methods.</p>

<p>Of course, it has helper methods for dumping table information and applying arbitrary SQL from files.  It's saved us a huge amount of trouble at work and has the nice benefit that if you have a database server running, you're not just hacking up a quick SQLite database for testing (as many folks do).</p>

<p>My boss has agreed that it's not a core-business tool, so we can potentially release this to the CPAN.  I'm surprised that I haven't found anything like this already.</p>

<p>Of course, there's also the matter of spare tuits.  If anyone is willing to, I'd happily send the code along for you to fix up for a CPAN release under your own name.</p></p>

<h2>Shameless plug - Test::TempDatabase :)</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bosu/">bosu</a> on 2007-07-09T11:50:37</h3>
Hi,
<p>
There is Test::TempDatabase module on CPAN which is unix specific and PostgreSQL only<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p>
Unfortunately, I don't work with MySQL so I can be of no help porting it.
</p><p>
Boris.</p>



<h2>Why MySQL?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2007-07-09T12:24:28</h3>
Why exactly is it MySQL specific? It's just templated SQL for the setup, so I assume that's no big deal...<br><br>what's the main problem stopping multi-database support?<br><br>

<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2007-07-09T12:38:15</h3>
<p>There's no significant problem in fixing it to support multiple databases.  It's a matter of refactoring a couple of things to make anything database-specific be easy to override in a subclass.</p>

I'm been thinking about adopting this kind of solution more lately. I seem to recall that Rails has something like this built-in.<br><br>A related thing I've done is store to "fixture" data  (default data) in YAML files, instead of as a bunch of SQL "insert" statements. I find this easier to read and edit, because the name/value pairs line up.<br><br>I have a small script "yml2insert" which filters the YAML syntax back into SQL insert statements.<br><br>I've thought about releasing this bit, but it makes most sense to me as part of a complete "test  database" solution, which I don't have now.<br><br>Also commonly, I use pairs of insert/delete routines for test data. The insert routines automatically add the stored IDs to a package-scope array.  The package includes an END block, which calls the "delete" routine.<br><br>The result is that I have an easy to create test data in a development database that is automatically cleaned up, without using a separate test db.<br><br>For projects where the DELETE statements take a long time to run, I have the delete routine add the IDs to tracking table, and a cron script does the actual deletes in the middle of the night.<br><br>



<h2>Tie in with DBIx::Admin::CreateTable?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ron Savage/">Ron Savage</a> on 2007-07-10T00:48:01</h3>
Perhaps your module could work with DBIx::Admin::CreateTable, which handles Oracle, MySQL and Postgres.

<p>That's an interesting thought.  Right now, I bulk load things through large SQL scripts.  They give me fine-grained control, but your suggestion would make it easier to test code on a variety of databases (a great tool for migration!).</p>

Oops. I can't find DBIx::Admin::CreateTable on CPAN!
I'll do something about that. In the meantime, try:
