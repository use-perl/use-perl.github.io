<div class="span8">
<p><p>I constantly find myself prototyping objects to get a feel for the best way they should integrate into something I'm working on.  Today, I had an odd little epiphany.  Consider the following:</p>

<pre>sub set {
  my ($self, $uuid, $object) = @_;
  $self->_cache($uuid, $object);
  return $self;
}</pre>

<p>That was my prototype method.  How do I get the UUID?</p>

<pre>$cache->set($object->uuid, $object);</pre>

<p>Since you get can fetch the UUID from the object, it almost seems silly to call this with two arguments so I'm looking at this (well, with a proper exception):</p>

<pre>sub set_object {
  my ($self, $object) = @_;
  die "Bad interface: no uuid() method"
    unless $object->can('uuid');
  return $self->set($object->uuid, $object);
}</pre>

<p>Now here's the interesting bit:  originally, I was going to have the caching system know how to cache <em>our</em> objects by checking inheritance.  Hand it an object built on top of our object relational system and it would just know how to proceed.  However, after a bit of thinking about it, I realized that was silly.  Instead, I just want to be able to cache anything with a proper UUID method to disambiguate it.  If I hadn't whipped up a quick prototype, there's a good chance I would have made the caching system dependent on our persistent objects and lost opportunities to cache other things.</p>

<p>Thus, by whipping up a quick prototype, I get a better chance to make more generalized objects and thus gain a more flexible, robust system.  I've done this quite a bit and never really considered that the exploratory prototyping is what led to this.</p>

<p>This journal entry brought to you by the letters Y-A-G-N-I.</p></p>

<h2>what is this prototyping of which you speak</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mr_bean/">mr_bean</a> on 2006-02-10T08:36:26</h3>
I thought you meant function prototyping as in<br>perlsub:<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perl supports a very limited kind<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of compile-time argument checking<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; using function prototyping.  If<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you declare<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sub mypush (\@@)<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then "mypush()" takes arguments<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exactly like "push()" does.<br><br>But it is the prototyping which you either ship<br>or throwaway.<br><br>I like that you can learn from your<br>mistakes. Doing things right is doing<br>the right thing. Doing things wrong is<br>education.
