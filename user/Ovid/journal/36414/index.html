<P>(Note that the acceptance and aggregate tests both emcompass the vast majority of those 14000 tests and simple aggregation is no longer a win.)</p>

<p>Since we're running at roughly 10 tests a second, I started paying attention to where we can gain wins and it looks like XML::XPath is a likely candidate for performance improvements.  In fact, the code has a number of areas where it could be improved substantially.  It's not been updated in years and I've contacted Matt Sergeant about having a colleague take it over.  This could also be an excellent opportunity to pay attention to its RT queue.</p>

<h2>Good luck with that</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mir/">mir</a> on 2008-05-14T16:11:12</h3>
<p>Is there any reason why you could not switch from XML::XPath to XML::LibXML? The code should be portable, except for a few constants that need to be renamed, I think.</p>

<p>In any case, if you have spotted improvements that can be made to the XPath engine of XML::XPath (as opposed to its DOM implementation) I would be interested to hear about it for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-XPathEngine" title="cpan.org">XML::XPathEngine</a cpan.org>, which is a fork of that engine.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>A quick switch of using <tt>XML::LibXML</tt> for <tt>Test::XML::XPath</tt> <em>doubled</em> the test time for one of our tests.  Of course, that was a single test run and there could have been other issues involved.</p>

<p>The major issues I saw for <tt>XML::XPath</tt> were getting rid of a lot of "shift" statements in favor of list assignments directly from <tt>@_</tt>.  There is at least one wrapper function which should be an alias and a rather curious looking AUTOLOAD.  Also, some of the C-style for loops can be worked on.</p>

<p>Other than that, I haven't looked that closely.</p>

<h2>Making XML::LibXML faster</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/arc/">arc</a> on 2008-05-20T13:46:31</h3>
<p>[Sorry about the tardiness of this reply.]</p>

<p>If <code>XML::LibXML</code> takes a lot longer than <code>XML::XPath</code>, there&#8217;s probably something bad going on.</p>

<p>In this case, I&#8217;d guess that the &#8220;something bad&#8221; is that <code>XML::LibXML</code> (or rather, the underlying <code>libxml2</code> library) is loading external DTDs over the network.  I can parse an 18-megabyte XML instance from a file in a little under a second on my laptop, once I turn off DTD loading.</p>

<p>Turning off the &#8221;run very slowly&#8221; flag can be done like this:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>my $parser = XML::LibXML-&gt;new;<br>$parser-&gt;load_ext_dtd(0);<br> <br>my $doc = $parser-&gt;parse_file($xml_filename);</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>If you&#8217;re thinking that loading external DTDs from the network is an undesirable default, I&#8217;m inclined to agree with you.</p>

<p>[Credit where credit&#8217;s due: though I have seen and dealt with this issue elsewhere, I was reminded of it just now by <a href="http://marc.info/?m=121128606406309" title="marc.info">this mailing-list posting</a marc.info> by Aristotle Pagaltzis.]</p>

<p>You are correct that something was wrong.  Turns out it was a completely unrelated error.  Regrettably, we've discovered that we can't just switch over to <tt>XML::LibXML</tt> because we have two different namespaces and <tt>XML::XPath</tt> was letting us ignore this issue (this was in place long before I started).  We have about 237 YAML documents driving our acceptance tests and they have multiple xpaths embedded which would presumably have to be changed to deal with this<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:/</p>

<p>In the interest of correctness it should be pointed out that <code>XML::XPath</code> is in violation of the XPath spec here, and that matching namespaced elements in XPath <em>always</em> requires binding a prefix to the namespace.</p>

<p>We are aware of this.  We're just in a bad position with some legacy code and since it hadn't been addressed previously, we need to figure out the easiest way to move forward.</p>
