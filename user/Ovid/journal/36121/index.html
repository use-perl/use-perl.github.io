<P>OK, it's not really a parser.  It only tells you if the tests failed or passed.  There's tons of information which it discards and it does virtually no validation of the TAP structure, but might solve <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Ovid/journal/36120">the nested TAP problem.</p></p>

<h2>Almost, but...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mpeters/">mpeters</a> on 2008-04-10T15:47:11</h3>
What about the return code of the stream? That's YAML, so you'd need a YAML parser. Then there's the whole discussion about the context: what if the status of the test is changed based on the context in which it was run? What if TAP changes? Say you have a TAP emitter which emits V14 and then it spawns another process that emits V15 and your V14 emitter is trying to capture that and nest it. Will the pass/fail rules you have for V14 work for V15?<br><br>I'm still not convinced that having a TAP parser, even a really simple one, is a good idea for a TAP producer.



<h2>Returns Codes</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2008-04-10T18:34:03</h3>
<p>Returns codes can be a legitimate concern, but in many cases these are unavailable anyway.  Also, context does not change whether or not a test succeeded or failed, it changes the interpretation of whether it succeeded or failed.  However, if something fails, it's better to default to failure in the absence of more information.</p>

<p>As for the v14/v15 issue, if we guarantee that TAP core doesn't change, we're safe.  This entire work is designed to eliminate the need to break backwards-compatibility.  I think we were far too rushed to make such a decision lightly.</p>
