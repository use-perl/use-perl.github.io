<p><p>Well, it's not really data mining but I wrote a <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/community/lj_clients/137527.html">program that would list the interests my friends have</a>, ordered by the popularity of the given interest.  As far as I can tell, LJ does not have robust tools for gathering said data, so I was forced to resort to HTML parsing.  Yuck.  The program has bugs, but it was a fun little exercise.  I ran it for a friend of mine and curiously, he discovered that the most common interest for his friends was "cats", but he's not particularly fond of them.  I, on the other hand, have a rather large number of friends interested in piercing, corsets, and candles (not the top interests, though.)  I'll not speculate as to what that means.</p></p>

<h2>Cool DRY-inspired idiom</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jplindstrom/">jplindstrom</a> on 2004-01-19T01:23:18</h3>
Very cool and useful idiom to declare variables inside the GetOpt call. I'll start doing that and not type things twice.<br> <br>Thanks.

<p>Thanks.  I saw that in someone else's code and I realized that <tt>my</tt> has a return value:  the variable that it's declaring.  This is not exactly clear from the docs, though.  Maybe I should submit a doc patch.  Hmm.</p>

I like using it as part of an if statement:<blockquote><div> <tt>if (my $foo = bar()) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; print "I got $foo\n";<br>}</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>-Dom</p>

I like the idiom but I've always been disapointed you can't write:<blockquote><div> <tt>if (my $foo = bar() and $foo =~<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/bar/) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;print "\$foo is bar\n";<br>}</tt> </div></blockquote>

<p>You can't do that because the variable doesn't come into scope until after the current statement finishes executing.  Fortunately, that's an easy fix.</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>perl -le 'sub bar{ "baz" };if ((my $x = bar())=~/baz/){ print "yes" }'</tt> </div></blockquote>

The problem is that that causes a warning if bar() returns undef.
