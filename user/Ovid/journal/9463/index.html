<p><p>Yup, Friday the 13th certainly lived up to its name.  It started off well with the company knocking off work an hour and a half early, drinking plenty of beer and decorating our Christmas tree.  That was the high point.  The low points quickly followed.  On one of my mailing lists, an announcement was posted that the club I was planning on attending was now alcohol-free, and not by their choosing.  It seems that a legal after hours party did something wrong (all I could find out from the promoter is that it did not involve anyone under 21) and the club lost their liquor license for about two months.</p>

<p>As I'm getting ready for the evening, I tried to use my debit card only to have it declined.  What???  I use a credit card instead, buy my stuff, and head to the bank.  I tried to make a transaction at the cash machine and the machine replied "Unauthorized transaction" and wouldn't return my card.  When I called today, I was informed that that my card account was closed since November 2nd.  I find this rather curious as I have been using it regularly since then.  Now I have to wait until Monday to get to my branch of the bank to find out what the heck is going on.  In the meantime, I can't even order another card and had to borrow some cash from a friend despite having plenty of money in the bank.</p>

<p>When I finally got to what is now effectively a Gothic Juice Bar, I was disappointed, but not surprised, to see a low turnout.  Those who showed up, however, all seemed to have alcoholic drinks.  Everyone seemed to have brought a flask of rum, whiskey, vodka, etc.</p>

<p>What's that you ask?  Did I bring a flask, too?  I cannot tell a lie.  Maybe I did.  Maybe I didn't.</p></p>

In Oregon, there's no such thing as a "legal after hours party" unless no alcohol is served.    A bar is not allowed to serve any alcohol between 2am and 7am (or even more restricted, depending on their license), even if it's not for public consumption.
<p>
I owned a bar for long enough in Oregon to learn the rules.  Dems da rules.</p>

<p>I could easily be mistaken about the exact circumstances involved, but I do know that this is not a bar.  This is a private club of which I happen to be a member.  Because they operate under a catering license, I do know that some of the laws regarding what they have to provide customers (in the way of food) are different, but I don't know about the other laws.  Is it still illegal under those conditions?  It sounds like it is.  Bummer.</p>

Did I mention that some legal regulations in the US strike me as very strange?<br>
