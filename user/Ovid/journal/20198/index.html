<h1>They want easy, not powerful!</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>As mentioned previously, I am completely taken off guard by the amount of positive feedback  I've getting regarding <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/ovid/Data-Dumper-Simple-0.05/">Data::Dumper::Simple</a>.  It's been so positive that I just uploaded version 0.06.  Why, though, the strong response?  The output is nothing special.  In fact, a couple of people made it clear that they already knew the Data::Dumper syntax that allows them to name variables in their output; they just didn't use it.</p>

<p>The secret, I've realized, is in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/joshua/">Joshua Keroes'</a> phone (some of you may know him as "ua").  His phone, like mine, has a camera.  His phone, unlike mine, blows chunks.  How do you take a photo with my phone?  Press the "camera" button and then keep pressin' that big, fat, round button until your phone runs out of memory with multiple photos.  Easy, eh?  How do you take photos with Joshua's phone?  He tried to show me.  I tried to remember.  It goes something like this (with the song "You can't always get what you want" playing faintly in the background):</p>

<ul>
<li>Enter to the menu system.</li>
<li>Select "camera".</li>
<li>Take photo.</li>
<li>You didn't want to save the photo automatically, did you?  So the phone makes you renavigate the menus to choose the "save photo" option.</li>
<li>But you were probably kidding, so the phone first prompts you with an "Are you sure?" dialog.</li>
<li>Now you have to choose where you want to save the photo ...</li>
</ul>

<p>Needless to say, Joshua doesn't take a lot of pictures with his phone.  I take plenty of pictures with mine (I have some photos I intend to blackmail Nicholas Clark with someday.)</li>

<p>The reason why people like <tt>Data::Dumper::Simple</tt> so much is that it's what it promises to be:  simple.  If you want more power, reach for a module which gives you that power.  For the 90%+ solution, DDS is what you want.  I really, really need to remember this.  I tend to forget that people value simplicity more than I think they do.</p></p>

<h2>KISS</h2>

I agree with the simplicity angle. That and I wanted to see how you were getting around the variable references.<br> <br>As for camera phones, I hate them. I just want a phone that works, has bluetooth, and gets a good single everyone. My Motorola V600 sucks as a camera phone.<br> <br>Keep up the good work. I'm still looking through the code. I like it. Don't understand 100% of it (about 80-90 %<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-), but I like it.<br> <br>Whenever I get back to coding again...



<h2>Blackmail me?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nicholas/">nicholas</a> on 2004-08-03T08:43:58</h3>
<blockquote><div>(I have some photos I intend to blackmail Nicholas Clark with someday.)</div></blockquote>
<p>Blackmail? Pah! Publish and be damned. The only thing worse than bad publicity is no publicity. (Bah. Frustrated by the Internet. I can't find a reference to the bit of <i>Yes Minister</i> where Jim Hacker is observing this, based on newspaper coverage of himself.)</p>
<p>It's a shame that I can't find a certain cream cake photo online anymore. I shall have to find the print and rescan it.</p>



<h2>Hence the popularity of PHP</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davebaker/">davebaker</a> on 2004-08-04T14:52:48</h3>
I wish we could get something in the perl world that's as easy to get STARTED with as PHP, for those people who want to do data-enabled web page creation. I think that's PHP's biggest drawing card. I hate to see so many young, talented programmers getting "diverted."
