<h1>Not Writing Perl 6</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>Today I have again failed to build Perl 6 on Solaris.  Eventually I managed to get it to compile on an older Linux box.  I figured a good place to check out basic functionality was to create a doubly-linked list class and see how easy it is.  That's when I discovered a lot of problems just trying to find good examples of Perl 6 code on the Web.  Where's a simple class with an object initializer?  I <em>think</em> I write something like this:</p>

<pre>class Node {
    has $.val is rw;
    has $.next;
    has $.prev;

    submethod BUILD ($self:) {
        $self.!linkto($self);
    }

    method !linkto ($self: Node $target) {
        $.next = $target;
        $target.prev($self);
    }
}</pre>

<p>Of course, that's just a stub class, but no matter how I try to write it, I always get a <tt>Statement not terminated properly at line 6, near "($self:) {\n"</tt> error.  Maybe submethods aren't implemented, but I figured I could examine the spectests to see what's there and that's where the real problem kicks in:  <tt>make spectest</tt> uses subversion to fetch the tests from the pugs repository.  Our firewall doesn't allow this.  I had planned to spend today working with Perl 6, but there are still too many obstacles for just casually playing around.  It's getting so much closer I can just taste it, but not yet.  Not yet.  Damn!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>  I give up.  I've tried multiple workarounds just to get a proper Node constructor up and running and everything is throwing errors :(</p></p>

<h2>Method::Signatures / Moose solution</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/markjugg/">markjugg</a> on 2008-10-30T16:50:59</h3>
<p>I wonder what the solution with Method::Signature and Moose would look like.</p>

<p>I've' tried some of that, and it's mighty fine crack.</p>

<h2>Unsupported</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2008-10-30T17:53:35</h3>
<p>I believe submethods and private methods are currently unsupported.  I can't find any submethods in the spectests, and I can get the code to parse if I remove "sub" and "!" appropriately.</p>

I believe the "my method<nobr> <wbr></nobr>..." syntax for private methods works, but not the ! yet.
