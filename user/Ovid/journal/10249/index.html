<div class="span8">
<p><p>I didn't program Java for very long, so I really never quite understood the best way to handle exceptions.  (The one thing that I miss  in Perl is compile-time checking of whether or not the exceptions are caught, but that's a side issue).  Recently, I was struggling to get an API just write (sic) and the simplest way to do it seemed to be the following:</p>

<p><tt>my $data = $self-&gt;__validate_added_data;<br>
if ( UNIVERSAL::isa( $data, 'Foo::Form' ) ) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# add the data<br>
}<br>
else {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# process the error<br>
}</tt></p>

<p>In other words, if I get back a valid Form object, I can add the data to the database.  Otherwise, I have a hashref that contains the form error information.  This error information is user error -- not program error.  As a result, I don't want to die or warn, yet variants of those are typical Perl error handling mechanisms.  Further, I have a method that returns two fundamentally different types of data:  and object or a hashref.  I finally started using the <tt>Error.pm</tt> module and now use try/catch blocks to handle the types of errors that I need.</p>

<p><tt>try {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my $data = $self-&gt;__validate_added_data;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# add the data<br>
}<br>
catch FormValidationError with {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# process the error<br>
};</tt></p>

<p>Combining this with <tt>Test::Exception</tt> has made my tests simpler and my code more self-documenting.  I'm going to have to dig up some resources on "Best Practices" with exception handling.  I like this.</p>


<p>Hmm ... I think I'll post this on Perlmonks and see what they have to say.</p></p>

<h2>Exception debate</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lachoy/">lachoy</a> on 2003-01-29T01:33:21</h3>
FWIW, I've noticed more discussion of whether checked exceptions in Java are worth the effort, particularly since they're not implemented in C#. There's a <a href="http://www.mindview.net/Etc/Discussions/CheckedExceptions" title="mindview.net">good writeup</a mindview.net> on the issues from Bruce Eckel, along with some <a href="http://www.mindview.net/Etc/Discussions/UnCheckedExceptionComments" title="mindview.net">related discussion</a mindview.net>.

<p>Absolutely wonderful writeup!  That definitely makes the think that checked exceptions might not be the WunderTool that I thought.  The problem appears to lie in programmers being pressed for time and thus "swallowing" exceptions with the intent to come back to them later.  We all know what a lie "I'll do it tomorrow" is<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<tt>try {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;doSomethingWith(foo);<br>
}
catch (SomeException e) {}<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/* exception swallowed */</tt>

<p>Knowing full well that I'm often under the gun at work, I could easily see myself doing that with <em>every intent</em> of coming back to it.  Three thousand lines of code later<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p>

<p>There is one benefit to checked exceptions that I see.  If I am using third-party software, I might not be aware of all of the exceptions that it throws.  It would be nice to see the uncaught exceptions at compile time.  Shipping a product after having failed to trap the <tt>YourCPUIsOverheating</tt> exception would definitely be a damper on my day (and perhaps my paycheck).  Why would I fail to trap it?  It's in the docs, right?  And I'm going to read the docs tomorrow.  Really.</p>

Watch out for the closures issue with Error.pm. I wrote about this in my exceptions talk <a href="http://axkit.org/docs/presentations/tpc2003/" title="axkit.org">here</a axkit.org>.

Ooops, I meant 2002 not 2003.

<p>That's a great article.  Thank you very much.  That was certainly a pitfall that I was not anticipating</p>
