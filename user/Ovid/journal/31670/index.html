<h2>Dilbert?</h2>

Hilarious! This [c|sh]ould have been a Dilbert stripe!<br><br>Sort of reminds me of a project I was on, where the project manager didn't have a clue about databases and thought that the sheer <i>number of tables</i> could result in a performance problem.<br><br>Theoretically it can, of course, but just by bad design. I needed to tell him that it was much more important to normalize the database as much as possible.

<p>That reminds me of one company I worked at where our new IT director went and asked our HR head what FTP was.  A bit more research into his resume quickly followed.  He was then fired when we found out he didn't have the degree he claimed.  Then he sent an email asking for his job back<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>That was the same company which hired a DBA who didn't know what normalization was.  I had to explain to him why <tt>ingredient1</tt><nobr> <wbr></nobr>.. <tt>ingredient8</tt> in a <tt>recipes</tt> table was a bad idea.</p>

I was once hired on a project, but in the middle of another, so I'd arrive 2 weeks after the start. It had to be done on Oracle, and I told them I wasn't an Oracle DBA, I'd only done very very simple things with it.<br><br>So one of the two other coders they hired was an "Oracle Expert".<br><br>On the first day I came up, he came up to me and asked.<br><br>"How do you implement AUTO_INCREMENT in Oracle?"<br><br>o.O

Ugh, I can just imagine somebody charging per character and having a client insist they golf all their programs.

<p>Don't I wish.  Fortunately, it's not a project I'm on.</p>

Well everyone has something I guess. The project I am on uses a 3rd party logistical tool that ties into an Oracle back end. The 3rd party company has a new version coming out early next year so they migrated the data from our version to their version. Every account in the new version is now locked up and they have no idea why that is so. Reassuring.

<h2>Similar situation</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grantm/">grantm</a> on 2006-11-20T21:06:03</h3>
A client uses us for software development and support and company X for physically hosting the boxes and required infrastructure.  Company X's monthly charge for maintaining a box increases with the number of CPU's, disk and memory in the box.  But the kicker is, if a box is designated a database server then the monthly cost is 40% higher for the exact same hardware!

Is the usage pattern of a database box different in some way that would mean it was maintained diffrently? I guess I could see an extremely high-load box costing more to maintain than others; this still feels rather nebulous though.
