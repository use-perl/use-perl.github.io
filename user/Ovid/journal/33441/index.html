<p>Yesterday I wrote this code right before I left and I blew quite a chunk of time trying to figure it out, even calling in another programmer who was totally mystified.</p>

<p>Today I sat down at my desk, opened up the code with trepidation, and said "oh, duh!", and immediately fixed the error.  I was really, really stupid yesterday.</p></p>

<p>Your &#8220;minimal&#8221; example was far from minimal so I suspected the wrong things for a long time&#8230; I guess that was your point. This was compounded by the fact that I have neither ProdDev::DBConnection nor a desire to install Exporter::NoWork, so I could only read and guess run than run it and poke around. Once I suspected the right thing I found the problem in 30 seconds; then I had to spend another 5 to rewrite to an actual minimal example to confirm the fix (ROT13ed):</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>qryrgr$VAP{qb{zl$x=$ZBQHYR;$x=~f!::!/!t;$x.".cz"}};</tt></div> </blockquote>

<p>You're correct about my posting the other stuff to make it a bit more obscure since that's how things work in real life.  I could have just posted the tests and said "that's enough to find the bug", but that would have made it too easy.</p>

<p>Your solution, by the way, is correct.  Of course, you knew that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Yeah. I admit that I might have been stumped <em>far</em> longer if I hadn&#8217;t read about this particular trap before, though I would have found it eventually. With knowledge of how the machinery in Perl works, it&#8217;s tractable, if not obvious.</p>

<p>The average J. Random Perlhacker doesn&#8217;t know enough though, I suspect, that they could track this down without help. I have often wondered if my fix shouldn&#8217;t be applied automatically on failures of the kind you deliberately caused. It also leads me to think that such checks should be delayed from compile time if you can at <em>all</em> help it &#8211; if yours were in <code>import</code>, say, you&#8217;d have avoided this headscratching moment.</p>

<p>(On an unrelated note, Exporter::NoWork makes me shudder&#8230; way too implicit. Give me Exporter::Tidy any day&#8230;)</p>

<p>I feel a bit odd about using <tt>Exporter::NoWork</tt>, but it's standard here, so that's what I go with unless I need fine-grained control.</p>

<p>I'm glad I got it right after only glancing at it, but I am surprised that anyone used to writing tests would have not have spotted it. You actually made me doubt myself as I thought it couldn't be that obvious and I was missing something. It was only on checking Aristotle's post that confirmed that I was right.
</p><p>Personally I would consider it bad form to have that sort of test script, as you're not cleanly testing the interface, as you've discovered<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) It also means you're not truly testing a user situation, which ultimately is what the test scripts should be testing.</p>

<p>(Another 5 minutes, that is. Also, that was supposed to say &#8220;read and guess <strong>rather</strong> than run it&#8221;.)</p>
