<p><p>You might want to be aware of a <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl-qa@perl.org/msg07454.html">Perl QA discussion involving creating Test::Harness 3.0</a>.  From the opening email of this discussion:</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Andy Lester sent me an email (which I'm relaying with permission)
saying that he feels the TAPx::Parser distribution is a good candidate
for Test::Harness 3.0.</p>

<p>To see how well this works, Andy Armstrong is now working on
TAPx::Harness::Compatible.  All of the Test::Harness tests have been
copied over and it's intended that all of them should pass before we
release this.</p>

<p>Obviously, nothing will get renamed to Test::Harness without Andy
Lester's blessing.  Further, nothing will simply be 'rushed into place'
without extensive testing and we want to feel *extremely* comfortable
that we're not going to break anything.  We want this to be
*completely* backwards compatible, but would like to hear feedback from
folks about any issues we might want to be aware of.</p>

<p>We're particularly keen to known what Rafael and Nicholas think, since
they're the pumpkings and keeper of the keys.</p></p>

With the blessing of Andy, I'll have no problem putting this in the core. We'll probably want to release 5.10.0 before that, though. Also, <tt>t/harness</tt> in the core will probably need adjustments to work with T::H 3.0.

<p>Is there an estimated timeframe for the 5.10 release?</p>

Timeframe, not really, but we have few problems left, and when it's done I'll release 5.9.5, which will be a 5.10.0-alpha. So, this will occur within a few months.

This would seem to fit really well with the other toolchain changes (like making the toolchain bootstrappable) it looks like we'll be making between 5.10.0 and 5.10.1.<br><br>With a bit of luck that should mean that 5.10.1 becomes the first "last Perl 5 you will ever need".<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>
