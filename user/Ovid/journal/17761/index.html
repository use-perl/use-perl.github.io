<p><p>As many of you know, Portland, Oregon (well, Multnomah county, but it makes no difference if you don't live here) recently started handing out marriage licenses to same sex couples.  As I've been an ordained minister with <a href="http://www.ulc.org/">The Universal Life Church</a> for fourteen years and have legally performed weddings in the past, I felt I could help out.  I performed seven weddings today.  I'm very tired and I think I'm going to bed now.</p>

OK, I applause your actions, which are probably the best thing you can do at    your scale,  etc. but I've something to point out. Being French, I still find
weird that priests and ministers are still allowed to marry people. And IMVHO I think one of the roots of the problem is here: in a country without proper
separation of church and state, there is some blurring between religion and
law, and that's typically what happens in this whole marriage thing. In France,
priests can't marry people since the IInd Republic (middle of the XIXth
century), which makes clear that religious and actual marriage are different
and unrelated things. Maybe what the USA needs is to adopt a new word for
marriage (and reserve the word "marriage" for the various religious forms of it.) This way, religious activists will be less tempted to try to apply their
points of view to citizens of a country which is supposed to guarantee equal treatment to all confessions.

<p>I will admit that it's a bit of an odd situation.  "Legal" marriage in this country has nothing to do with religion (in theory), so the idea that only certain government workers and religious ministers can fill out the paperwork (the ceremony is superfluous from a legal standpoint) is a tad odd.  It is, essentially, a contract.  Boeing doesn't need a Reverend officiating over their contract signing with their union, though I confess that it would possibly make things more amusing<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

First- great job.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  Along with <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=18937" title="perl.org">Schwern</a perl.org>'s description, you've given me a good picture of what my friends Bonnie and Sara have been up to- other than being photographed on national news.
<p>
About the odd situation of law and marriage- a different perspective is found among the Quakers.  <a href="http://www.quaker.org/" title="quaker.org">We've</a quaker.org> been marrying people without ministers for 300-odd years- because as a faith, we don't have ministers. (Or, more accurately, we don't have laity.)  One of the community responsibilities is marrying people.  Everybody at the ceremony signs the wedding certificate.  Long before, during, and long after the wedding, a small committee (yes, that's actually the word we use) is responsible for meeting with the couple and helping with any concerns they (or the committee) might have about the marriage.
</p><p>
So it's an example of an intentional community taking care of what we think really matters to us and to God.  As opposed to leaving it to the State.
</p><p>
I've been told that the English Quakers were the originators of marriage licences (as opposed to marriage banns) but I might be confusing that a bit.
</p><p>
And I'm happy to say that many <a href="http://flgbtqc.quaker.org/marriageminutes.html" title="quaker.org">quaker groups</a quaker.org> have been marrying same-sex couples for  over fifteen years.</p>

It is a shame that the Law *is* being broken. I read the Oregon statute and the courts are going to say the man-&gt;woman inference is implied. Unfortunately, I think this whole thing is going to piss off the majority of Americans and it will end up as an amendment to the constitution. I hope it doesn't end up like that but I think because people have taken the law into their own hands its going to force it to go that way.

Civil disobedience has place when civil rights are being ignored by a governement. I'm not well placed to judge whether it's the case currently in the US, but I'd like to point out that the black people who fought for their most basic civil rights decades ago faced exactly this kind of discriminatory remarks.

<p>To broadly impugn the motivations of same-sex couples that desire to get married seems to fit the "discriminatory" definition quite nicely.</p>

<p>Many of my friends are gay or bisexual.  I know what their motivations are.  I was down their marrying people who are gay, I saw their tears of joy.  Couples who had been together for many years (one older couple told me they had been together for 17 years) are finally getting a chance to have the same rights previously restricted to opposite-sex married couples.  Same-sex couples want equal rights (equal rites?).  It's time we end special rights for opposite sex married couples.</p>

<p>Those, and many other rights make no sense in the context of a single person.  It's like asking "what color is Wednesday?"  (Assuming you're not flying high on acid).  Either end discrimination in who gets those special rights or we end those special rights entirely.</p>

<p>OK, I see what you're asking now.  I didn't before.  Sorry about that.</p>

<p>Because of the way the law works, if I get married, I automatically have those rights conferred on my spouse.  If I am not married and I want to have those rights, I frequently have to hire a lawyer, assign power of attorney, make a will, etc.  This is not only expensive, but it's more easily challenged in court by relatives or other interested parties who might not approve of my decisions.  I think this falls back to my feeling that those special rights shouldn't be granted simply on the basis of marriage, but since those rights are not going to be eliminated any time soon, I would rather that as many people have access to those special rights as possible.</p>

<p>While I understand what you're asking, I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.  Are you suggesting that these special rights should automatically be available to everyone regardless of marital status?  If so, it seems as if the legal basis for marriage becomes irrelevant and marriage reverts to a religious institution.  As such, giving same-sex couples the right to marry would be moot as they could easily find a minister who is willing to officiate at their ceremony the legal concept of marriage could cease to exist.  If you're suggesting something else, I'm curious to know.</p>

<p>Absolutely.  If our goal is equal protection under the law, we ought to do it right, not piecemeal.  If it's wrong to deny a citizen the right to assign power of attorney based on that person's marital status, we ought to remove that right from marital status.</p>

<p>I realize this won't solve all of the difficult issues (homosexual marriage for green cards?), but it seems to make a lot of problems go away.  Plus, it's even less discriminatory from where I sit.</p>

Was what you did illegal?  If not, good.  If so, 'tis a shame.  I don't buy the "civil disobedience" argument at all.  I don't see this as a clear example of discrimination, firstly: if society decides the purpose of marriage benefits is to encourage and aid an institution that produces children, then certainly there's no discrimination here.  However, if the purpose is to encourage and aid cohabitation, conservation of resources, *raising* children, etc., then there are other ways to provide the same benefits without marriage.<br> <br>Secondly, there are many ways to go about changing the law without breaking it, as we see with the many legal challenges currently in the works, most of which were brought about without breaking the law.  Breaking the law should be a last resort.<br> <br>But whatever, I just figured I'd throw in my two cents.  I don't have a huge problem with ministers officiating: I have a greater problem with government officials breaking the law, and an even greater problem with people like the mayor of New Paltz who got up in front of the world and told a bald-faced lie, over and over again, that he didn't violate the law.<br>

<h2>Re:Legal</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2004-03-24T15:58:20</h3>
<p> <em>Was what you did illegal?</em> </p>

<p>After a fair amount of research, I have to conclude that it was.  Regardless of the ambiguous wording of Oregon law, the intent of the law was fairly clear and legal decisions are often based on intent, even if the law is worded as poorly as ours.</p>

<p>As for the "children" argument, I don't by them.  Yes, maybe the Catholic (amongst others) Church dictates that marriage is for procreation, many churches do not and many people do not.  While there are plenty of federal and state laws that deal with marriage and children, there are many more that do not.</p>

<p>The "for the children" arguments is similar to the Second Amendment debate over the "well regulated militia" phrase (I keep thinking I may have discussed the following here before...).  The legal argument frequently surrounds whether this is a "qualifying" phrase (reason for) or an "exemplifying" phrase (example of).  The courts frequently hold that it's a qualifying phrase and thus states can regulate our right to keep and bear arms because arms can be regulated in such a way that a militia's arms may be regulated.  If a court rules that it's an exemplifying phrase, then the right to regulate militias is irrelevant and there is therefore no Constitutional right to regulate arms.  The "children" argument is similar.  Now many people are rallying around the "for the children" battle cry, but they assert that bearing children (not just having or raising them, because same-sex couples can adopt or have children from a previous marriage) is the reason for marriage.  If so, why aren't they being logically consistent and banning sterile people from marrying?  If I get married again, should they insist upon a signed affidavit from me and my wife that we will attempt to produce at least one child (presumably with each other<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)?  I find it interesting that those who use this argument only target same-sex marriages and ignore the logical consequences thereof.</p>

<em>Breaking the law should be a last resort.</em>

<p>This is a tough one.  The first thought that pops into my mind is "Rosa Parks."  Had she not broken the law, the civil rights movement would likely not have gained as much ground as it did.  Even today, we have areas trying to ban gay people, wanting to make sodomy illegal, permitting discrimination based upon sexual orientation, etc.  I can see absolutely no <em>legitimate</em> distinction between interracial marriage and same-sex marriage.  Opposing either is bigotry and reading the arguments used today, one finds them often similar to the arguments used against interracial couples.  Still, breaking the law should not be done lightly and I'm hard-pressed to figure out the dividing line.  I completely understand why many who have no problem with same sex marriage still oppose my actions.</p>

At best -- being as objective as I can -- I'd have to conclude the intent is ambiguous, and the wording is ambiguous, and that therefore tradition should stand until a court rules otherwise, or the law is modified.<br> <br>We ran into something like this when I was acting chair of my town Finance Committee.  The letter of the law said that the Finance Committee did the budget, but the Town Council did it.  The letter of the law was clearly against the tradition, so we figured, we do the budget.  However, upon further investigation, the people who wrote and voted for the bylaw in question said their intent was not how we read it!  So, I was perfectly happy to defer the Town Council, even though I preferred the meaning as we had read it, and we suggested they modify the wording of the bylaw in the future.<br> <br>That is: intent &gt; letter &gt; tradition.<br> <br> <em>As for the "children" argument, I don't by them.</em> <br> <br>I wasn't asking you to.  The point is that the purpose of a civil institution like marriage should be dictated by the people.  If we agreed collectively that this is the purpose, then forbidding homosexual marriage would not be discriminatory.  However, it would also require other significant changes to our marriage laws, esp. regarding divorce, and benefits for childless couples, so I don't think that would ever happen (as you note).<br> <br>I am not in favor of such a thing, and your points here are well-received; I was just making the point that forbidding homosexual marriage is not, by logical necessity, discriminatory, and further, that the purpose of civil marriages is the real point here.  Why do we have them?<br> <br>I offer that the real reason today -- insofar as the government is concerned -- is to provide rights and benefits to cohabiting pairs of adults in exchange for a more stable and efficient society (including preservation of resources, raising of children, lower reliance on public assistance, etc.) and that the *nature* of the relationship between the adults is irrelevant to the government's purpose.  And as such, we should not forbid homosexuals from marriage, nor brothers, nor sisters, nor close friends, etc.  And as such, we should change the name.  Hence my motto: civil unions for all, civil marriages for none.<br> <br>Also consider that the real reason we have this problem is because marriage is, and has always been (in our society), an intimately religious establishment, on the whole.  And yet Congress is to make no laws regarding such.<br> <br> <em>The courts frequently hold that it's a qualifying phrase and thus states can regulate our right to keep and bear arms because arms can be regulated in such a way that a militia's arms may be regulated.</em> <br> <br>Yes, many courts intentionally misrepresent the clear intent of the phrase to suit their own beliefs, unfortunately.<br> <br> <em>The first thought that pops into my mind is "Rosa Parks." Had she not broken the law, the civil rights movement would likely not have gained as much ground as it did.</em> <br> <br>If that is true, it only bolsters my argument, because we *already had* a strong focus on this issue before people started breaking the law (not necessarily you, but clearly, the law was broken in San Francisco and New Paltz, for example*).  The Massachusetts Supreme Court had already ordered homosexual marriages for this May, and people from California were already going to go to Massachusetts, get married, come back, and sue for their rights (arguing that DOMA is unconstitutional).<br> <br>Things were already moving ahead rapidly; there was no need to break the law.<br> <br>And speaking of weapons and breaking the law, what would happen if a mayor in Texas decided that the assault weapons ban is unconstitutional, and issued licenses for them?  Would you be comfortable with that?<br> <br> <em>Even today, we have areas trying to ban gay people</em> <br> <br>Huh?<br> <br> <em>wanting to make sodomy illegal</em> <br> <br>They can want to all they wish, but it is already decided.  Sodomy is legal in the U.S., period.  The SCOTUS decided this last summer.<br> <br> <em>permitting discrimination based upon sexual orientation, etc.</em> <br> <br>Usually not legally, except in especially tricky cases, e.g. churches who won't hire gays.  But these trickier issues will not be resolved for years to come, if ever, and the homosexual marriage issue at hand is unrelated to them.<br> <br>* I don't know who cares, but in San Francisco, the state law clearly said marriage is between one man and one woman; to marry homosexual couples, to provide licenses to them, is clearly illegal, unless the courts overturn the law.  In New York, the law is less clear, but the mayor there solemnized marriages without licenses, which is, unequivocally, a crime.

<p>That's only because I wasn't terribly clear.  I think the intent was to define marriage as between one man and one woman and that the legislators simply worded the law poorly.  Sorry for the confusion.</p>

<p> <em>Even today, we have areas trying to ban gay people<br>
<br>
Huh?</em> </p>

<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0319-10.htm" title="commondreams.org">Rhea County in Tennessee</a commondreams.org>.  It was all over the news a few days ago.

<p> <em>And speaking of weapons and breaking the law, what would happen if a mayor in Texas decided that the assault weapons ban is unconstitutional, and issued licenses for them? Would you be comfortable with that?</em> </p>

<p>Again, I have no idea where to draw the line and this causes me much confusion.  I do agree that the ban is unconstitutional, so I would actually have a bit of sympathy for the mayor.  I don't think that civil disobedience is always good or always bad, but I don't know how to judge.  I can say "only as a last resort", but how do I define last resort?  It can get awfully murky.</p>
