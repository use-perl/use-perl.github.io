<p><p>In the Trinity College study <a href="http://www.americanreligionsurvey-aris.org/reports/NONES_08.pdf">American Nones: The Profile of the No Religion Population</a> (PDF), we find that the Republican Party has troubling times ahead.  The "nones" are those described as "no religion" in the <a href="http://www.americanreligionsurvey-aris.org/">American Religious Identification Survey 2008</a>.  The "American Nones" study has this to say about "nones":</p>

<blockquote>Nones are easily misunderstood. On the one hand, only a small minority are atheists. On the other hand, it is also not correct to describe them as Ã¢â¬ÅunchurchedÃ¢â¬Â or Ã¢â¬ÅunaffiliatedÃ¢â¬Â on the assumption that they are mainly theists and religious searchers who are temporarily between congregations. Yet another incorrect assumption is that large proportions of Nones are anti-rationalist proponents of New Age and supernatural ideas. As we will show, they are more likely to be rational skeptics.</blockquote>

<p>Amongst some of the highlights of the survey, it found that in 1990, 6% of Democrats were nones and 6% of Republicans were nones.  Today it's 16% Democrats and 8% Republicans.  Nones are currently 15% of the population, but that number is expected to rise to about one fourth of the population in 20 years.  Further, <a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/god-and-country/2009/09/22/4-ways-the-no-religion-boom-will-alter-american-politics.html">fewer than 10% of nones under the age of 30 are Republicans</a>.  If the present trends continue, the Republicans are going to find it harder and harder to sway voters.</p>

<p>In short: the Republicans are actively chasing away one the largest and fastest growing demographic groups in the US.  I wonder, perhaps, if they're actually responsible for this group's growth.</p></p>

<p>I think most believing Democrats are simply closet-atheists.</p><p>With Republicans, I think religious belief is a given, and not just for the polls. These are mostly religious-based politics in Republic-ville.</p><p>A simple survey that asks "could you accept the U.S. as a non-religious country?" would show the non-religious acceptance between these parties. One party has a good change of acceptance while the other sees it from a religious-oriented way.</p><p>While the believing Democrats would surely try to cater to the atheists crowd, the Republicans count on a religious youth and a religious state and therefor focus more on the religious or close-to-religious crowd.</p><p>Just a penny.</p>
