<div class="span8">
<p><p>A coworker called me over on a problem he was completely stumped by.  His boss was completely stumped by it, too.  The problem looked like this:</p>

<pre>use Foo;
my $foo = Foo->new;</pre>

<p>Which resulted in the error <tt>Can't call method "new" on an undefined value...</tt>.  I admit it had me stumped at first, but a quick session in the debugger and stepping through the code revealed the problem.  Both 'strict' and 'warnings' were enabled, so the problem is not related to that.</p></p>

<p>I haven't gotten done guessing the last problem, yet!</p>

<p>Is the problem apparent from the code snippet you posted, alone?</p>

<p>The problem is caused by something else and that something else is <em>not</em> in Foo.pm.  But once you realize what's going on, you'll slap your forehead and say "of course!"</p>

If there's a subroutine called <tt>Foo</tt> that returns an undefined value, you get that error message.<blockquote> <div><tt>sub Foo {}<br>use Foo;<br>my $foo = Foo -&gt; new;<br> <br>__END__<br>Can't call method "new" on an undefined value at...</tt></div> </blockquote>

<p>Yup.  I was called over to look at the problem and it simply didn't occur to me that someone would name a sub after a package name.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that you are the author of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/aliased/" title="cpan.org">aliased</a cpan.org>?</p>

<p>With <tt>aliased</tt>, the sub is not the package name -- it's a shorter version -- and in any event, because it has a null prototype, it gets inlined away and no subroutine is left in the symbol table.</p>

<p>However, that's still a pretty lame defense on my part<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Yeah, but it&#8217;s used like a package name, on the left side of an arrow operator.</p>

<blockquote> <div><p>it gets inlined away and no subroutine is left in the symbol table.</p></div> </blockquote>

<p>Not at all. It gets inlined into calls, but the subroutine is always there.</p>

I'd say that as well as providing an Object-Oriented interface, for some strange reason, Foo.pm is also exporting a function called Foo() you can use directly.<br><br>Which is stupid of course, since now when doing OO you have to say<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Foo::-&gt;new;<br><br>The subroutine is found before the word is treating as a string (and thus class) and so Foo() returns undef, which gives your error.<br><br>I seem to recall encountering this during my AppSpace days a few times, with the end result I wrote a standard symbol table scanning unit test that would fail if it ever saw that specific subroutine/class clash.<br><br>I think the code might even be in Test::ClassAPI still, since that was spun out of that code...<br>

No. If Foo.pm exports a sub Foo, there's no problem.

Sorry?<br><br>The specific problem is function vs class name. Why does it matter where the subroutine comes from?<br><br>Specifically, if Foo contains sub Foo::Foo { undef } and exports it, what differs it from my defining sub Foo { undef } by hand?<br><br>What am I missing here? Something different about the *Foo glob?<br><br>Adam K
