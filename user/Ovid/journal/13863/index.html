<div class="span8">
<p><p>Ever have one of those days when you insist upon coding yourself into a programming hell?  I had a problem with a very tricky data structure that was forcing me to pull out common elements from a hashref of arrays and do some weird transformations that were very easy to describe, but very difficult to implement.  By the time I was done, I used tye's <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=44763">mapcaru</a> (think of a map that works on multiple arrays simultaneously) function and in a space of about 30 lines, I had a total of 14 maps, greps, and mapcarus.  Somehow, it worked perfectly, but I'm going to have to throw it all away because I barely understand it and I know that whoever maintains it won't understand it.  The absolute worst section:</P>

<pre>
@bad_names = map { $_->[0] } @bad_names;
my $array  = 
    mapcaru( 
        sub {[@_]}, 
        @{mapcaru( 
            $get_common_words, 
            @bad_names )});
my @clean_names = 
    map { join ' ', @$_ } 
    map { [non_empty(@$_)] } 
        @$array;
my %names = 
    map { @$_ } 
    mapcaru( sub {[@_]}, \@name_ids, \@clean_names);
</pre>

<p>When even I can't read it, it gets a bit embarrassing.  I'm still trying to figure out why I get myself into the "I will make this square peg fit into the round hole" mindset.  I'm much better than I used to be, but the above is one of the worst monstrosities I think I've written.  On the other hand, the tests pass with flying colors.</p></p>

It's in a very functional style, that's all.<br> <p>True, most Perl programmers would have trouble maintaining it, and this is a valid concern.<br> </p><p>Maybe you should comment it heavily and stare at it until you understand it forward and backwards.  There's a lot to be gained by functional programming.  Generally, the fewer the intermediate variables and the less the code, the _better_ the maintenance in the long run.<br> </p><p>Obnoxious comment.  Could you make it even more functionally gnarly with something like this (untested)?<br> <code> <br>my %names =<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; map { @$_ }<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mapcaru( sub {[@_]}, \@name_ids,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [map { join ' ', @$_ }<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; map { [non_empty(@$_)] }<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mapcaru(<br>

<p>Aack!  I'll pretend you didn't write that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>One of the reasons why I break things into smaller steps like I did is that it's easier to insert debugging statements.  As for the above, I wound up using an entirely different strategy suggested by Gav.</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>sub _set_up_names {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my ($self,$products) = @_;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $length = 0;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my @names =<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; map {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; local $_ = [$_-&gt;id, [split ' ', $_-&gt;name]];<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $length = @{$_-&gt;[1]} if @{$_-&gt;[1]} &gt; $length;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $_<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; @$products;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $length -= 2;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $count = @names;<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; # assume length &gt; 0 -- must test<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my ($index,$name) = (0,'');<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; FIND_COMMON_NAME: {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $name = '';<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; foreach $index ( reverse 0<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.. $length ) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $name = join ' ', @{$names[0][1]}[0<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.. $index];<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if ($count == grep { $name eq join ' ', @{$_-&gt;[1]}[0..$index] } @names) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; @names = map { $_-&gt;[0], join ' ', splice @{$_-&gt;[1]}, $index + 1 } @names;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; last FIND_COMMON_NAME;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my %attributes = @names;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return ( $name, \%attributes );<br>}</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>It's still pretty wonky (and the above is just a first pass), but it solves my problem.  It also much smaller than my original solution of which my earlier snippet was only a small subset.</p>

I've heard this argument about inserting debug statements, but I think it's oversold.<br> <p>If I have something in an extreme functional style and I need to debug it, I just replace one of the function calls with a call to a  function_debug wrapper.  In my above extremely functional style, you could add map_debugs or mapcaru_debugs which would print arguments and then apply the map or mapcaru function.<br> </p><p>One added advantage of this is that you can get all your maps or mapcarus to confess at once, often yielding unexpected insight.<br> </p><p>However, I do think that turning Perl on it's head to look like Lisp is probably not a good idea.  As I alluded to above, maintainability is a good argument against this sort of thing.  It is pretty arrogant to assume that everyone will be in love with your own odd taste for functional style.<br> </p><p>OTOH, I do spend a lot of time correcting annoying bugs with interim variables, like I might use $name for $names in your above example.  Sure, this is quickly found, but it's annoying and you can stare at it for a few minutes wondering what you've done wrong.<br> </p><p>When I write in a functional style, I sometimes feel that there are fewer things that can go wrong.  But, I'm not sure.<br> </p><p>The short functional solutions sometimes just <i>feels</i> so elegant, but that's a personal taste thing.</p>

<p>You could always make the arguments of a smug Lisp weenie:</p>

<ul>

<li>everyone knows that only heretics use <em>insert some common construct here</em>!</li>
<li>you don't really need to do that</li>
<li>anyone who can't understand that code isn't worthy of programming computers</li>

</ul>

<p>As for me, a smug Perl weenie, I think you may go better pulling out a couple of subroutines.  I don't write a lot of loops anymore.</p>

<p>I could have sworn I put on my "maintainable code" hat this morning.  Oh well!</p>

<p>If your Ward Cunningham number is appropriately low, you'll know a <em>Confident XP Weenie</em> would say, "What would happen if you extracted a couple of those transformations into their own methods?"  Unlike smug weenies, confident weenies are subtle.</p>

Guess who is kicking himself for missing the chance to get his Ward number down to 1 at OSCON this year? Ward even <em>asked</em> me to show him something in the Squeak image and I said "Um... bit busy, can I catch up with you later" and I never did.
