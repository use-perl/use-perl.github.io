<p><p>I deliberately did not write a journal entry yesterday as I was positive that use.perl would be swamped by entries related to the horror of a year ago.  I was surprised to not see much of that.  Still, I think I should post a nice counter-balance to the pain much of us have experienced.</p>

<p>Last year, before 9/11, I had a falling out with a very dear friend whom I had known for years.  It was pretty serious and if she and I wound up being in the same room, we would say nothing to one another.  However, on the morning of 9/11, I called her apartment and woke her up to tell her what was going on.  Later that evening, we sat together and cried -- as much about our lost friendship as the horror of that day.</p>

<p>When we finally had regained some composure, we talked.  We talked for a long time about many things.  We each apologized for our respective roles in our disagreement and slowly we have regained our friendship.  Our friendship today is not what it was, but in some ways, it is stronger than ever.  She lives in another state and we don't hang out as much as we used to, but I called her last night to tell her that at least <em>something</em> good came from the tragedy and she replied "that's one of the first things I thought about this morning".</p></p>

For so many people it changed their perception of what was important. It's good to hear that both of you have grown from your experience. I wasn't directly affected by the event - other than that twelve people world-wide from the company that I work for lost their lives.
