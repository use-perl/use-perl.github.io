<div class="span8">
<p><p>Last night, in working with <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Ovid/journal/34086">Devel::Recreate</a> (suggest a better module name, please!), I discovered that it's devilishly difficult to differentiate between <tt>use</tt> and <tt>require</tt> or capture import lists.  After discussions with Andy Armstrong, the only thing I could think of is either coderefs in <tt>@INC</tt> or overriding <tt>*CORE::GLOBAL::require</tt>.  I can't tell if either solution allows me to differentiate between the <tt>use</tt> and <tt>require</tt>.  The only thing I could think of is that <tt>use</tt> is basically this:</p>

<pre>BEGIN { require Module; import Module LIST; }</pre>

<p>In other words, if <tt>require</tt> is triggered, I could use <tt>HookLexWrap</tt> to wrap the import statement (considering inheritance, of course) to fetch the import list.  I'd also have to write some XS code to try and grab <tt>PL_beginav</tt> to find out if the <tt>require</tt> happened in the BEGIN phase.  Thus, the following would be considered a <tt>use</tt> statement:</p>

<pre>BEGIN {
    require Some::Module;
    Some::Module->import(@args);
}</pre>

<p>Naturally, this is all very rickety.  Is there a better way to do this?</p></p>

<h2>Naming</h2>

<p>First of all, &#8220;<code>Devel::</code>&#8221; is reserved for things to be loaded using <code>perl</code>&#8217;s <code>-d</code> flag. (It should have been a more specific namespace, really, so people wouldn&#8217;t be tempted to dump random junk in there that has nothing to do with <code>-d</code>, maybe <code>DB::Custom::</code> or something.)</p>

<p>Also, &#8220;<code>Devel::Recreate</code>&#8221; gives no indication whatsoever about <em>what</em> it recreates. That would be a package, which suggests that the right TLNS for your module is &#8220;<code>Package::</code>&#8221;.</p>

<p>Now, what does it do with a package? It &#8220;recreates&#8221;&#8230; what exactly? It doesn&#8217;t actually <em>re</em>create anything! In fact, it seems like the name was the source of Ben&#8217;s confusion about its purpose. What it does is more like a dumper, but for code, not data.</p>

<p>That suggests &#8220;<code>Package::CodeDumper</code>&#8221;.</p>

<p>Another choice could be &#8220;<code>Package::SourceDumper</code>&#8221;, but I almost dislike that one because it vaguely suggests that it dumps the original source, not the code that&#8217;s actually in memory.</p>

Maybe, Package::OpCodeDumper?<br><br>Then again, it isn't the opcodes, at least from my weak grasp of the internals, is it?

<p>Nope.  Not trying to dump opcodes, though I may be forced to dig into them at some point.  Just trying to dump what perl thinks the source code looks like.</p>

Isn't this about dumping how much of the module exists when it dies during load?  Seems like caller() from a $SIG{__DIE__} hook and a line number would suffice.  What am I missing?  Are you trying to get valid perl output, or just information?<br><br>To really do it right, I think you end up source filtering (PPI?) everything (unshift(@INC, sub {...})) into s-expressions or something.  I've always wished perl were more introspective, but it seems like syntax is the enemy of introspection (and I really like syntax, so I haven't pursued lisp deeply enough to know if that's really the case.)
