<p><p>For various reasons, I've never had the pleasure of delving into <tt>mod_perl</tt>.  Typically, it's been the insistence of the company that because we run Windows and IIS, <tt>mod_perl</tt> is simply not an option for us.  We gained some performance benefits with ISAPI, but it just wasn't good enough.  Now, however, the tide is changing.  We're switching over to Linux/Apache and <tt>mod_perl</tt> is our future.</p>

<p>Interestingly, though, we still do much of our development on Windows.  Naturally, I was worried about <tt>mod_perl</tt> on Windows, but I gave it a shot.  I couldn't believe how easy it was to install (there's even a ppm!).  I couldn't believe how easy it was to configure.  I couldn't believe how much faster my test sites ran.  I couldn't believe how fast they crashed and burned as soon as anyone else tried to access them.</p>

<p>Damn.</p>

<p>Also, seeing the following in my error logs was more than disturbing:</p>

<p><tt>Unbalanced scopes: 45 more ENTERs than LEAVEs<br>
Unbalanced saves: 382 more saves than restores<br>
Unbalanced tmps: 121 more allocs than frees<br>
Unbalanced context: 36 more PUSHes than POPs<br></tt></p></p>
