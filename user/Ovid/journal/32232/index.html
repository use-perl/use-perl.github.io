<p><p>So I was debugging a MySQL problem and quickly hacked out the following query.  It took a long time to run before finally giving me an 'OUT OF MEMORY' error:</p>

<pre>SELECT distinct(ip)
FROM   foo
WHERE  ip NOT IN (
  SELECT distinct(ip)
  FROM   bar
)</pre>

<p>See a problem with that query?  The problem I have is one you <em>can't</em> see.  A coworker pointed out a typo.  There's a <tt>bar.id</tt> column, but not a <tt>bar.ip</tt> column.  MySQL didn't catch that.  It was apparently trying to run the outer query, collect all results and <em>then</em> parsing and filtering on the subquery.</p></p>

<h2>Oracle</h2>

The folks at Oracle realized that antijoins were often performance bottlenecks and provided hints to specifically to speed them up, e.g. HASH_AJ, and specifying the optimizer type (RULE vs COST) can make a huge difference.
<p>
I'm curious what the point of the 'distinct' in the subquery is, btw. I think that would make the explain plan worse in Oracle. But I digress.
</p><p>
For stuff like this in Oracle, I generally opt for the simple minus query.  Reasonable performance and easy to understand.
</p><p>
How do the following compare in MySQL?
</p><ul>
<li>Anti-join with NOT IN</li>
<li>Anti-join with NOT EXISTS</li>
<li>Anti-join using MINUS</li>
<li>Anti-join using outer join.</li>
</ul>

<p>I couldn't really say how those others compare.  I'm not a performance guru.  I've traditionally gone more for the normalization aspect and not worried as much about the implementation, trusting the DBAs to be good at their jobs.  Now I'm finding I need to focus on the implementation more and more.</p>

<p>As for the 'distinct' clause in the subquery, I really thought there might be duplicate ip addresses in that table and I had no idea if MySQL would optimize those away or force every value to be compared multiple times.  I should look at the 'NOT IN' behavior more to see how it handles bags instead of sets.</p>
