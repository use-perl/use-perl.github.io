<div class="span8">
<p><P>Today I faced a bug in this code:</p>

<pre>$self->set_build_data([
        $self->build_primary_element,
        $self->build_identifiers,
        @build_event_in,
        @build_event_of,
        [
            offset => {},
            ($rs->offset ? $rs->offset->in_seconds : undef)
        ],
        [ position => {}, $rs->position ],
        [ title    => {}, $rs->title ],
        $self->build_synopses,
        $self->build_from('Taggings'),
        $self->build_resultset_links(qw/taggings changes/),
    ],
);</pre>

<p>I saw that the <tt>build_from('Taggings')</tt> method wasn't returning the taggings.  I put this code into the <tt>build_from</tt> method:</p>

<pre>sub build_from {
    my ( $self, $type ) = @_;
    $DB::single = 'Taggings' eq $type;</pre>

<p>The <tt>$DB::single = $some_true_value</tt> code sets a breakpoint.  When you run the code through a debugger, hitting 'c' for "continue" will run the code up to that point and then halt there, waiting for you to issue additional commands (as a fun exercise, 'ack' for <tt>DB::single</tt> in your installed CPAN modules).  That let me easily step into the code and find out that <em>something</em> prior to that method call had altered the state of the object and prevented my tags from being built.  But let's look back at that code again.  I didn't relish stepping into every one of those methods and finding out which was the offending code.  As it turns out, it's the <tt>$self-&gt;build_context</tt> data which was getting altered.  However, I can't just <tt>warn</tt> on those values because this fails:</p>

<pre>use Data::Dumper;
$self->set_build_data([
        $self->build_primary_element,
        warn Dumper($self->build_context),
        $self->build_identifiers,
        warn Dumper($self->build_context),
        @build_event_in,
        warn Dumper($self->build_context),
        ...</pre>

<P>It fails because <tt>warn</tt> returns a true value and thus destroys my list.  However, there's an interesting feature of lists which many people are not aware.  An empty lists collapses out of a list.  The following list has two elements, not three:</p>

<pre>my @two_element_list = (1, (), 2);</pre>

<p>Now you can just have a subroutine return any empty list and safely make subroutine calls in the middle of a list.  However, because of how lists work, you can't rely on line numbers via <tt>warn</tt>, so you need the <tt>__LINE__</tt> directive to get the correct line number.  That leads to the following code:</p>

<pre>use Data::Dumper::Simple;
my $warn = sub { 
    my $line = shift;
    warn Dumper($line, $self->build_context);
    return (); 
};
$self->set_build_data([
        $self->build_primary_element,
        $warn->(__LINE__),
        $self->build_identifiers,
        $warn->(__LINE__), 
        ...</pre>

<p>And near the top of my test output, I see the following:</p>

<pre>$line = '35';
$self->build_context = {
  'expand_junction' => bless( [
    'promotions',
    'segments',
    'taggings'
  ], 'Perl6::Junction::Any' ),
  'uri_base' => bless( do{\(my $o = 'http://localhost/')}, 'URI::http' )
};
$line = '42';
$self->build_context = {
  'expand_junction' => bless( [
    'promotions',
    'segments'
  ], 'Perl6::Junction::Any' ),
  'uri_base' => bless( do{\(my $o = 'http://localhost/')}, 'URI::http' )
};
63 at /home/ovid/pips_dev/work/Pips3/branches/exploratory/lib/PIPs/API/Builder/SegmentEvent.pm line 60.
$self->build_context = {
  'expand_junction' => bless( [
    'promotions',
    'segments'
  ], 'Perl6::Junction::Any' ),
  'uri_base' => bless( do{\(my $o = 'http://localhost/')}, 'URI::http' )
};</pre>

<p>And now I can instantly see that I lost the 'taggings' build context right after I called <tt>build_identifiers</tt>, thus telling me quickly where the bug in my code was.</p>

<p>An even shorter way to write that is this:</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>(map {;} warn "in here\n")</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>However, I prefer to take a page from Javascript, by defining the following amusing function:</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>sub void {}</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>I can then write the code in this much nicer way:</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>(void warn "in here\n")</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>This is far nicer than Ovid&#8217;s approach as well, IMO.</p>

<h2>return();</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jarich/">jarich</a> on 2009-05-27T00:34:39</h3>
<p>
<code>return()</code> with no arguments (which is what you're doing) does the "right thing" in both scalar and list contexts.  It returns either an empty list or undefined value.
</p><p>
Thus you could also have written:
</p><p>
<code>
return;
</code>
</p><p>
for the same effect.  I'm sure you know this already, but from your commentary and style it did look like you were trying to explicitly return an empty list.

<p>Yes, I normally just use  a bare return (and get annoyed when people use 'return 0' for false), but I honestly didn't think about that here because I originally had this:</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>my $warn = sub { warn Dumper($self-&gt;build_context); () };</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>That showed the annoying <tt>__LINE__</tt> problem and I decided to be explicit about the return when I added the <tt>$line</tt> variable.  Normally about the only time -- aside from this example -- I return an explicit empty list is when I do this:</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>return $condition ? $some_value : ();</tt></p></div> </blockquote>

<p>Oh, and what I didn't say, but should have, in my first reply was "thanks".  The bare return is (IMHO) a cleaner solution.</p>

<p>For less trickery with subs and call stacks and line numbers, remember your old friend 'do'!</p><p>$ perl -le'print join " ", (1, do { warn 2; () }, 3)'<br>2 at -e line 1.<br>1 3</p>
