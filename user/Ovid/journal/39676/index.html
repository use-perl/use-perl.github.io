<div class="span8">
<p><p>Like many Perl programmers, I've kept at my "comfortable" level of Perl for a long time.  This is partly just not wanting to upgrade, but it's also partly because I want to ensure that code I release to the CPAN works for versions of Perl that most people have installed (which is why I don't worry about 5.005 support that much).  However, there are many reasons to switch to 5.10.</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>say</tt></li>
  <li><tt>state</tt></li>
  <li><tt>given/when</tt></li>
  <li>Smart matching</li>
  <li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Regexp-Grammars/">Regexp::Grammars</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Modern-Perl/">Modern::Perl</a></li>
  <li>... and much, much more</li>
</ul>

<p>But my real reason?  Snow Leopard.  When I upgraded to Snow Leopard, my system somehow got horribly corrupted.  I managed to rebuild my 5.10 installation, but 5.8 wouldn't work because <tt>Compress::Raw::Zlib</tt> wouldn't work.  Once I installed that manually, I found that CPAN wouldn't work because it requires <tt>Mac::Files</tt>, part of the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Mac-Carbon/">Mac::Carbon</a> distribution.</p>

<p><a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Mac-Carbon">Mac::Carbon doesn't install on Snow Leopard with 64-bit Perl</a>.  In fact, in going through Pudge's blog entries on this topic, none of the various techniques I tried worked.  Lots of google hits related to this, but I found no solutions.  I finally gave up and switched to 5.10.  All because of one critical module.  Maybe this isn't a bad thing?</p>

<p>(Of course, it was <em>real fun</em> to discover that Mac Ports added a new PATH= line to my <tt>.bash_profile</tt>, putting <tt>/opt/local/bin</tt> <em>before</em> <tt>$HOME/bin</tt>.)</p></p>

<h3><a href="/user/melo/">melo</a> on 2009-09-26T15:43:51</h3>
<p>Hi,</p><p>the main reason that makes Mac::Carbon not compatible with perl5.10 in Snow Leopard is that perl is compiled as mixed 64bit/32bit and Carbon is a 32bit only API.</p><p>If you compile perl5.10 32 bit only, Mac::Carbon should install just fine.</p>

Thanks so much for posting this.  I searched<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.profile,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.bashrc and couldn't figure out why<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/opt/local/bin was taking precedence until I found this post.

<p>I had opened a <a href="http://trac.macports.org/ticket/21625" title="macports.org">ticket for this with macports</a macports.org>, but they closed it as they can't reproduce it.  Until someone can document clear steps needed to reproduce this, it won't get fixed<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:/  (which is annoying, but reasonable).</p>
