<div class="span8">
<p><p>Last week, while at the same Test Automation Conference <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme/journal/30947">Acme attended</a>, I had an inspiration.  Given that <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl-qa@perl.org/msg06671.html">Yahoo! is using my <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/TAPx-Parser/">TAPx::Parser</a>, Torsten Shoenfeld <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/TAPx-Parser/examples/tprove_gtk">has written a GTK front end for it</a> (I need to include his name directly in the POD), Shlomi Fish is <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl-qa@perl.org/msg06751.html">integrating TAPx::Parser with</a> <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Run/">Test::Run</a>, people are starting to send me patches and there's a general increase in interest for it, it's time for me to get this thing out of alpha.</p>

<p>How better to do that than to run <tt>TAPx::Parser</tt> against all of CPAN?  Since I use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/rjbs/CPAN-Mini-0.550/">CPAN::Mini</a>, I have most of the CPAN on my hard-drive.  As it turns out, testing everything isn't practical, but I can test most of it.  My initial plan is to discard all Apache and Win32 specific modules, anything without a <tt>Build.PL</tt> or <tt>Makefile.PL</tt> file or a <tt>t/</tt> directory.  I might be tossing out too much, but I still have thousands of packages I can test on my iBook.</p>

<p>I get through about 200 of them before my code can no longer fork (something about "resource not available") and I can't even run <tt>ls</tt> in a directory until I kill my code.  This has turned out to be very difficult, but I've learned a lot about my code and have already found some strange edge cases it can't handle.</p>

<p>In other news, Acme wants to install your tests with your code so you can test that your installation works.  What a brilliant idea!</p></p>

<h2>Testing installation?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjore/">jjore</a> on 2006-09-11T16:37:04</h3>
Is that a common problem, installation failures? Instead of installing the tests somewhere can't it just do some kind of -I to get @INC set?<br><br>I don't know of any traditional location for tests in production and I'd rather there not be a pile of clutter under my @INC directories while a dozen different people all decide to use some different scheme for storing their tests somewhere.

<p>I want you to install your (<code>Test::Class</code>-based) tests as normal modules so I can reuse it when I reuse your modules.</p>

That is just the mental shove I needed to see why I'd possibly ever care about Test::Class. Thanks!

<p>There are plenty of other reasons to use <tt>Test::Class</tt>.  Do you have thirty <tt>t/*.t</tt> programs?  You've just loaded the perl runtime at least 30 times (probably more).  You've also probably reloaded the tested modules many times and possibly duplicated a lot of test code.  With <tt>Test::Class</tt>, you only load the Perl interpreter once and the associated modules once.  Large test suites can run much faster and are easier to refactor.</p>

<p>And inheriting tests to ensure that derived classes don't break their parents makes me giggle with happiness.</p>

<h2>Throwing away less testable modules</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grinder/">grinder</a> on 2006-09-12T15:05:58</h3>
Even if a distribution lacks a<nobr> <wbr></nobr>./t directory, it may have a test.pl script. Hence, you may want to adjust your criteria for discarding untestable distributions.<br>

<p>I had considered that, but a number of <tt>test.pl</tt> modules don't output TAP (largely because they're older code).  As a result, my parser can't reliably parse their output.  My goal here, in reality, is not to test all of the CPAN, but to have a massive stress test of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/TAPx-Parser/" title="cpan.org">TAPx::Parser</a cpan.org>.  I still have several thousand test suites left which I can use and I've found a few bugs I need to address.</p>

<p>That being said, I doubt all tests in <tt>t/*.t</tt> are based on Perl's regular testing tools, but I have to start somewhere.</p>

<p>Yes, I had considered that you had considered that.</p>

<p>In which case, it would be handy to know what <tt>test.pl</tt> scripts aren't TAP-compliant. I know early versions of Compress::Bzip2 (before it was taken over by the current maintainer) featured a test script that produced nothing useful.</p>

<p>It would be nice to have an exhaustive list. Then we could go about fixing them, if the distributions in question are useful enough to be worth the attention.</p>
