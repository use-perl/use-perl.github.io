<h1>Solaris Fail</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>Recently we found another bug with <tt>xmllint</tt> (which uses <tt>libxml</tt>) whereby it tells me that valid XML documents fail to validate against our RelaxNG schema.  I locally upgraded <tt>libxml</tt> and the documents validate just fine, so we put in a support ticket to have <tt>libxml</tt> upgraded.</p>

<p>After receiving confirmation of the upgrade, I tried again and the document still failed to validate.  A quick check of my <tt>$PATH</tt> environment variable indicated that I was using the wrong <tt>xmllint</tt>, so I used the full path to the correct one.  The document still failed to validate.  Hmm ... maybe I misunderstood which <tt>xmllint</tt> I needed.</p>

<pre>$ which -a xmllint
no -a in ...</pre>

<p>What?  A quick check of <tt>man which</tt> (gotta feel odd typing that) reveals that the Solaris <tt>which</tt> implementation doesn't include the <tt>-a</tt> option.  This is as useful as shipping a <tt>grep</tt> program which doesn't allow the <tt>-r</tt> switch (of course, <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=38594&cid=61062">many Solaris utilities are so crippled as to be useless</a>).  Why on earth would Sun do this?  Do they just not care about how useful their operating system is?</p>

<p>A quick Perl script dropped in my <tt>$HOME/bin/</tt> directory gets around this limitation, but honestly, I hate having to worry about whether the system I develop on is useful.  Some unix-beards might not see an issue because they've no problem with typing something like:</p>

<pre>grep -l somestring $(find somedir -type f |grep -v svn)</pre>

<p>Or you could say "screw it" and type <tt>ack -l somestring somedir</tt>.</p>

<p>That's one of the reasons I love <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/ack/">ack</a>.  It does what I really want without me having to worry about the exact syntax of a long string of commands.</p>

<p>I honestly wish more programmers would focus on making easy-to-use tools.  It's great having the flexibility to combine a bunch of commands together to perform a complicated task, but honestly, why would I want that to be the default?  Most of the time I really just want to get things done.  Don't make it hard for me.</p>

<p>End result:  it turns out the admins did install a new version of <tt>libxml</tt>.  They just didn't install it on the box we originally requested it for.  That was rectified, but they only upgraded to 2.6.26.  That still fails to validate a valid document.  libxml 2.7.2 also fails to validate the document, but 2.7.5 succeeds.  Too bad 2.7.5 won't compile on our Solaris.</p>

<p>It's going to be a long day.</p></p>

<h2>Synchronize your versions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjore/">jjore</a> on 2009-10-02T16:46:03</h3>
<p>Be careful while upgrading libxml or libxslt to keep your XML::LibXML or XML::LibXSLT libraries within compatible range. $work has used these for awhile and we've learned that it is not ok to upgrade the perl or C library independently without checking that the two consider each other compatible.</p>



<h2>gnu?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jsut/">jsut</a> on 2009-10-02T16:57:20</h3>
That's an example of why we install all of the gnu tools on our solaris machines at work.



<h2>Solaris</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vek/">vek</a> on 2009-10-02T22:43:18</h3>
<p>I've developed on Solaris for years and actually think it's quite a nice platform.  When we bring a new host online I always ask the nice sysadmins to do two things</p><p>1) Install gnu tools.<br>2) Build a stock Perl from scratch.</p><p>Once done, I'm quite the happy developer.  But yeah, I've felt your pain in the past.  Just that now I know how to make things a little less painful.</p>



<h2>So, 'Solaris Fail' is a tautology, right?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ron Savage/">Ron Savage</a> on 2009-10-02T23:19:59</h3>
<p>Hi Folks</p><p>Sounds like all us Slowlaris suffers are coming to the same conclusion:</p><p>Install Perl in order to install ack!</p>



<h2>Syn</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2009-10-03T17:19:14</h3>
I gave up on grep -r a while ago, even on platforms that supported that option, because it just didn't work the way I wanted it to or, in some cases, at all.
<p>
Ack is definitely the way to go.</p>
