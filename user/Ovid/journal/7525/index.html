<p><p>Who the heck told candidates that they can cuss in an interview?  We actually had one guy (who was trashing a former boss), use the word "shit" in an interview (though not while trashing the former boss -- then he kept using the word "hated").  Don't get me wrong; I've been known to cuss at my workplace, but from a prospective employee?  I don't get it ...</p>

<p>And on an unrelated note:  my brother just bought a house and soon after Barclay's decided to shut down their Internet Banking division.  Since that's where he works, he may be out of a job.  If it weren't for his new house, he'd be on the first plane over to the U.S. begging me for a bed.  Damn, damn, damn.</p>

<p>Hey, if any of you live in England, will ya swing by and burn down his house for me? <strong>:-)</strong></p></p>

<h2>Cussing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/shockme/">shockme</a> on 2002-09-04T23:17:16</h3>
I cussed during the interview for my current job.  Actually, now that I think about it, I cussed during my interview for my last 3 jobs (2 of which I quit, and my current job).
<p>
I pretty much talk like a sailor (no offense to the sailors out there) in my day-to-day life.  Somewhere along the line, I think I just decided to always be myself, whether it's a job interview, a picnic or what-have-you.  I know you're supposed to put your best foot forward during an interview, but for me, being myself <i>is</i> my best foot.  They know what they're getting themselves into, and I get to find out how "uppity" they are.  It somewhat reduces the element of surprise.

Of course, I don't get invited to many church socials any more<nobr> <wbr></nobr>....<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>
