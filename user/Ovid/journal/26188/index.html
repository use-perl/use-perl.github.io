<p><p>Why is it that when I get a really, really tough programming problem I want to whip out some paper and write out ideas?  I'm sitting in front of my iBook.  It has all the tools I need.  There's just something really comforting about writing on a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>In other news, I'm almost finished with a first-draft of an AI::Prolog article for The Perl Review.  This is <em>not</em> written on paper.</p></p>

<h2>paper vs. keyboard</h2>

I know what you mean. At work it took me quite a long time to become comfortable taking notes about phone calls on my computer rather than a piece of paper. At least on my part, it was completely irrational and ineffiecient to use paper, especially since I'm a fairly quick typist and my handwriting sucks. I finally wrote a script called "work" that would create a file, put it in my work_log directory, and fire up vim. I still instinctively reach for paper to take notes.



<h2>Paper, or even better a big whiteboard</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2005-08-09T05:53:38</h3>
I think at some point in a difficult problem it becomes an issue of capacity. You want maximum neurons on the problem, and as few context switches as you can.<br><br>We've been using crayons since we were 3 in most cases, and just drawing requires very little mental effort.<br><br>Using a computer requires thought to drive the interface, and when what you really want is an analog and unstructured extention to your brain, pen based stuff is hard to beat.<br><br>And a whiteboard is like paper, but with an undo<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br>

It&#8217;s the lack of structure in general. You can scribble anything (whether it&#8217;s even a letter or not) onto any place of the paper, you can fold the paper itself, etc. Doing anything on a computer requires and forces structure to your activity, which is not a good match when you&#8217;re trying to revv your brain and free-associate.
