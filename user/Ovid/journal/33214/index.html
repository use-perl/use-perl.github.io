<p><p>I signed up for <a href="http://www.uk-yankee.com/">UK Yankee</a> since, obviously, I'm a Yank amidst the Limeys.  Signing up for this Web site was a long, painful process.  Very painful.</p>

<p>First, I couldn't find a 'register' link on their home page, just a typical login form.  I clicked around on a few pages and couldn't find any way to register with the site.  So I clicked login and 
there's my 'register' link.</p>

<p>Next was their use of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">CAPTCHA</a> on the registration page.  Not only was there no option available for blind people, the fonts chosen were so terrible that it was difficult to guess what the CAPTCHA actually said.  Is that a '1'?  Is that a '7'?  Who knows?  I'm not used to seeing a '1' with such a long serif that it could be mistaken for a '7', but there is was.  Of course, at first I didn't see that it only allowed hex characters -- I've never seen such a limitation with CAPTCHAs before -- so I thought the '1' was an 'l' and the '0' was a 'O' (yes, I'm deliberately not clarifying those).  At one point, I got the CAPTCHA wrong three times in a row!</p>

<p>Then when I filled in the CAPTCHA correctly, I was astonished that it accepted my randomly chosen password:</p>

<pre>46dk3m,er+`'</pre>

<p>The vast majority of sites I encounter break on the single quote (SQL injection) or don't allow various punctuation characters (stupid).  Of course, even though it accepted my password, it certainly didn't let me log in with it.  Grr ...</p></p>
