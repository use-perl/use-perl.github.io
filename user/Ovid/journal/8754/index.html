<div class="span8">
<p><p>Saturday night, a friend calls up and invites me to a party that he's just been invited to.  Is it all right if I show up without an invite?  Sure it is.</p>

<p>I show up, the host is gracious, and out of some weird sort of coincidence it turns out that I had quite a few friends there.  Then there were the people that I didn't know:  <a href="http://www.goddessseverina.net/">a professional dominatrix</a> who advertises in the back of a local paper, the artist behind <a href="http://www.opi8.com/sequence/list.php?dir=whitenoise">White Noise</a>, and a couple of ladies on the couch who were being extremely indiscreet.  Oh, wait, I know one of them.  I used to work with her and and we have many mutual friends.  Oops.  Hope she didn't notice me being at the party.</p>

<p>In the meantime, my friend realizes that he's thirsty and somehow gets the idea that quenching said thirst with multiple vodka tonics is a good idea.  Fortunately, I stopped drinking early otherwise we wouldn't have been able to go anywhere.  Of course, we barely went anywhere anyway.  He rarely has more than one or two drinks at a time, so tonight he wound up being violently ill and I had to pull the car over every block or so lest he soil my car.  What an evening.</p></p>
