<p><p>For a while I was unemployed and living off of credit cards.  While unemployed, I racked up some credit card debt (surprise, surprise).  Today, I was most pleased to pay off one of my cards.  I paid online and that, I think, was a big mistake.  I was rather concerned because their Web site was poorly designed.  It was slow, it wasn't clear how to navigate and had graphics worthy of a third-grade HTML page.  I ignored that but frankly, that should should have been a tip-off.  If they couldn't spend the money to make it look professional, why should they care about professional code on those areas where you <em>can't</em> see it?</p>

<p>After paying my bill, I started thinking about that and figured I would check out what they set for my cookie.  I like reviewing cookies from time to time because they can be rather informative.  If I had access to your computer and you used this site to pay off your credit card, here's what I could learn just by glancing at your cookie:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What company (if any) the card was issued to.</li>
  <li>Your login name on the site.</li>
  <li>Your first and last name (as it appears on the card).</li>
  <li>What email address you used to register with the site.</li>
  <li>The last date you logged into the site on.</li>
  <li><strong>Your credit card number.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Your PIN number.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Gosh, at least they weren't foolish enough to list the expiration date!  Then we might have a security problem.</p>

<p>Oh, and the cookie doesn't expire for a year.</p></p>
