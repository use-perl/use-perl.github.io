<p><p>We have some clients who shall remain nameless, but who pay us a lot of money to do work for them.  They just pay and pay and pay and never, ever ask us to finish the changes.  The product is in a constant state of flux as they develop new management directives and I just shrug off their "change of the week" because I have no expectation of this product ever being delivered, but they seem to be perfectly happy with that.  We've been ready to unveil it on several occassions, but last minute "minor" changes put a halt to that.</p>

<p>One "minor" change that they requested was making the font on one of the pages smaller.  It seems that they were entering such long, verbose descriptions of their offices that the description was causing a scrollbar to pop up in the browser window.</p>

<p>Okay, they get a smaller font.</p>

<p>Later, they ask what we can do about too much whitespace between paragraphs and at the top and bottom of descriptions.</p>

<p>Okay, we tweak the HTML and the CSS and get rid of extra whitespace.  Their descriptions can now all fit within a single browser window without scrolling.  How do they respond?  They're so happy with the extra space that they start entering longer descriptions.  I received an email from them today complaining about the scrollbar that pops up ...</p></p>

Sounds like something you should submit to Scott Adams.  Man, that's funny!



<h2>Implemented</h2>

<blockquote><div>I've received your request to make the font smaller and have implemented it.  It wasn't too hard, really, only took a couple of days.  All you need to do to turn it on is hit control minus.  If you would like to make the font bigger just hit control plus.</div></blockquote>

<p>My eyesight is terrible so I usually need decent sized fonts.  I absolutely hate it when websites muck around with the font size.  My browser will display it at the size I want, thank you very much.</p>
