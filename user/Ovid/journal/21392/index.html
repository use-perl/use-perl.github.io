<p><p>Sometimes refactoring will take you down some strange paths.  I have a subroutine that needs to be exported to other test classes.  This subroutine mocks up certain portions of the <tt>SOAP::Lite</tt> interface so I can pass in the return XML and also see what the request XML looks like.  I've implemented an entire class within a subroutine.  I don't think this is really a good piece of code, but it was interesting to write.</p>

<pre>sub _mock_soap_interface {
    package MOCK::SOAP::INTERFACE;
    require Sub::Override;
    require SOAP::Lite;

    my $xml  = shift;
    my $token = Sub::Override->new(
        'SOAP::Lite::call',
        sub {
            my $self = shift;
            my $serializer = $self->serializer;
            $request = $serializer->envelope(method => shift(@_), @_);
            return $xml;
        }
    );
    *MOCK::SOAP::INTERFACE::xml = sub { ${shift->{_request}} };
    bless {
        _request => \$request,
        _token   => $token,
    } => __PACKAGE__;
}</pre>

<p>And using it:</p>

<pre>my $request = _mock_soap_interface($response_xml);
my $soap = My::SOAP::Lite::Subclass->new;
my $results = $soap->get_some_service;
# test results
my $request_xml = $request->xml;
# test that request XML is properly formatted</pre></p>

I'm confused.<br> <br>What does it mean to change package within a sub?

<p>Well, package declarations are lexically scoped.  It would have been simpler for me to have simply declared another package in that file and have the subroutine return a new object created from that package.  Instead, just because of the way the refactoring worked, I had simply wrapped the package in the sub and now that I look at it, I can't see why this would be a bad thing.</p>

<p>There's no real benefit that I can tell, but there's no real harm I can identify, either.</p>

Quite simply, it means that when you enter the sub you're in one package, and then at some point during the sub the current package changes.  I recently did something like that, and it was also because of some refactoring.

<p>I have a bunch of classes, all subclasses of a single class, and all pretty similar.  I broke a ton of code out into a "helper" module which they all <tt>use</tt>.  However, part of that is to call a method in the class's superclass, like this:

</p><p> <tt>
package Foo;<br>
@ISA(qw(Bar));<br>
<br>
use HelperMethods;<br>
<br>
sub blah {<br>
    # massage data<br>
    return HelperMethods::blah(...);<br>
}<br>
<br>
########<br>
<br>
package HelperMethods;<br>
<br>
sub blah {<br><nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>
    $class-&gt;SUPER::blah(...) # call calling class's superclass's blah()<br>
}<br>
</tt>

</p><p>Trouble is, although in <tt>HelperMethods::blah()</tt> the <tt>$class</tt> variable is correctly set to <tt>Foo</tt> (indicating that this was called from <tt>Foo::blah</tt>), but it doesn't work.  This is because <tt>SUPER</tt> is evaluated in the context of the current package (<tt>HelperMethods</tt>) and not really in the context of $class.

</p><p>The solution was:

</p><p> <tt>
    eval "<br>
        package $class;<br>
        \$class-&gt;SUPER::blah(...);<br>
    ";<br>
</tt>

</p><p>The extra step of the <tt>eval</tt> is needed because <tt>packge $class</tt> is illegal - package names must be constant.</p>
