<p><p>If you've ever looked at the original paper for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Abstract_Machine">Warren Abstract Machine</a> (a fast, proven correct virtual machine for Prolog), your head probably hurts.  That's why you probably want <a href="http://www.vanx.org/archive/wam/wam.html>the WAM tutorial</a>, by Hassan AÃÂ¯t-Kaci.  It's still incredibly hard to work through and you have to read it <em>carefully</em>.</p>

<p>I initially tried to write a lexer/parser and then realized I was being stupid.  Perl already includes its own lexer/parser for the Perl language itself!  Thus, all I need to do is write Perl code which generates an abstract syntax tree.  Easier said than done.  My first pass looked like this:</p>

<pre>p(   # example straight from the WAM tutorial
  $z, 
  h( $z, $w ), 
  f( $w ) 
);</pre>

<p>The problem with this our lack of lazy evaluation.  The inner terms would get evaluated prior to the outer terms and I was losing some ordering information because I couldn't tell if various predicates were terms in another predicate.  With a bit of trickery, I can make each predicate have an anonymous subroutine as an argument.  They let me check to see if I'm in an anonymous sub and, if so, I know I'm contained in another predicate. (and yes, this is valid Perl code and those upper case letters really are variables).</p>

<pre>p {
    Z, 
    h { Z, W }, 
    f { W }
};</pre>

<p>That's the same thing, but the <tt>(&amp;)</tt> prototype trick allowed me to capture just the extra bit of semantic information needed to proceed with parsing.  Now my heap looks like this, just as in the WAM tutorial:</p>

<pre>my @expected_heap = (
    [ 'STR' => 1 ],
    'h/2',
    [ 'REF' => 2 ],
    [ 'REF' => 3 ],
    [ 'STR' => 5 ],
    'f/1',
    [ 'REF' => 3 ],
    [ 'STR' => 8 ],
    'p/3',
    [ 'REF' => 2 ],
    [ 'STR' => 1 ],
    [ 'STR' => 5 ],
);

eq_or_diff heap, \@expected_heap,
    '... and it should build our heap correctly';</pre>

<p>I also have the registers correctly ordered, but there are some bits of the tutorial I need to read a bit more carefully to make sure I haven't done anything stupid.  This is frickin' hard work!</p></p>
