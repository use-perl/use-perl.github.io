<p><p>I'm going to do the count-down by actual days and not business days as weekend time might be a possibility.</p>

<p>My co-worker who's the lead on the POS project has finished refactoring some methods out to a base class and has finished the tests for said class.  Meanwhile, he has some issues with another system he has to resolve, thus pulling him away from the POS project.</p>

<p>Our largest client has requested some changes to a Web-based application that I have been building for them, pulling me away from the POS project.  Most of the changes are limited to the presentation layer and one to the persistence layer, so things are fairly straightforward.  Hopefully, I'll get back to the POS soon.  What I want to know, though, is what fallback position our client has.  With a critical deadline with untested technology, <em>everyone</em> needs to have backup plans.  Somehow, though, I have fears about that...</p>

<p><b>Update:</b>  Turns out that one of the presentation layer issues is a simplified version of the "packing problem" (e.g., what's the most number of boxes I can fit into a larger box).  It's not <em>too</em> tough, but it will slow me down.  I also noticed that one of the requests requires changes to all three layers:  programming, persistence, and presentation.  Ugh.  Even less time for the POS.</p></p>
