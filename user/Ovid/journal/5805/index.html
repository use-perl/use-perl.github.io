<p><p>Well, I'll start writing the credit card validation module now.  Apparently, the docs for the system are buried in a download (one of three).  One download is the MainStreet Credit Verification Engine (MCVE).  The second download is the C API, and the third download is the Perl API.  The Perl API was a laughable joke with no documentation.  I wasted a few of hours going through their site, searching newsgroups and searching the Web in general trying to find this damned documentation.  Turns out the the docs I needed were an HTML document in the C API download.  Naturally, my C is pretty rusty, but this stuff is really easy to read.</p>

<p>Incidentally, during the seach, I discovered, amongst other things, that there's a Yahoo! group for MCVE:  "mind-control victim's
experiences".   I decided not to read anything in that group.</p>

<p>Test count:  689.</p></p>

Wow. I looked at the "most recent messages" for the yahoo group you mentioned and I was amazed. The kookiness of people never ceases to astound me.
<p>
From the description:<nobr> <wbr></nobr><i>...One of my close friend was being mind controlled recently. And this let us form a even closer cycle with each other and this seems to be a strating point in facing the miserable future under the endless harrassment of the MC towards the end of one's life.</i>
</p><p>
Umm, yeah, whatever. I know lots of people being mind controlled. But it's by their spouses so I don't think it counts.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>

<p>Okay, I can't claim to have perfect grammar or speeling (sic), but at least the stuff that I type is relatively coherent.  Maybe it's just me, but why do nut cases so often appear to be grammatically challenged?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
