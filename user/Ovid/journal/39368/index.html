The fact that it has no dependencies makes it even more compelling.  It's the sort of thing one could more easily attract new developers with.  Can you imagine rewriting my old CGI course with something like this?  Or maybe a way to introduce new users to Perl?  There are many excellent Perl frameworks out there which I would, nonetheless, hesitate to start new users on.  Just trying to set up CPAN can be difficult for them; working through even one test failure is often too much.

<p>Yes, folks, blog posts are often marketing, whether deliberate or not.  If you blog about your breakfast, it's probably not marketing, but if you're a chef, it might very well be.  Marketing is <em>not</em> something you can discreetly identify.  Heck, I've lived for quite some time with someone who has directed marketing at a number of companies around the world.  One of my best friends used to do marketing for Waggener Edstrom, Microsoft's PR firm (or maybe former firm. Don't know).  While I'm hardly an expert in marketing, I've been amazed at a lot of the clever stuff they've come up with and it's a far, far cry from the "waste of time" that some people are calling it.</p>

<p>Marketing isn't just ads.  It's not just articles in newspapers.  It's not just viral videos.  It's not just guys walking around in crazy costumes handing out leaflets.  It's also people touting their latest Web framework in their blogs.  It's people teaching classes about Perl 5.  It's people giving talks at users groups about software testing.  It's word of mouth.  It's anything you want it to be, so long as you connect producers and consumers and get your message out there.  I find it hilarious that many of the people decrying marketing are, in fact, marketing themselves (even though they don't know it).</p></p>

Heh. Sukria released Dancer at about the same time on the CPAN, and the two packages do roughly the same thing.<br/><br/>Too bad they did not communicate on the matter a little bit earlier. The two projects look like really fun alternatives to ruby's Sinatra.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br/><br/><a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/sukria/Dancer-0_0.99/lib/Dancer.pm" title="cpan.org">http://search.cpan.org/user/sukria/Dancer-0_0.99/lib/Dancer.pm</a cpan.org>

<p>
Hello, to be frank, reading this makes me sick.
</p><p>
So it seems, they actually came on GitHub, found out Dancer, and just fork it?
Whithout even taking five minutes to send me an email about that?
</p><p>
Marketblogging about it then smells like arrongance to me, as they don't even take the time to quote the origin of their work.</p><p>
What is the purpose of such a behaviour? Splitting the Perl community in small groups that work one against the other?
</p><p>
I really don't understand. I'm surprised to see how big some egos are...
</p><p>
Anyways, just for the record, I'm clearly not in the mood of stopping Dancer's development just because of a new-born fork project. I will continue working on it, with the help of whoever wants to join, and the leading idea will be to write a nice Perl framework, with dependencies when it makes sense (which seems to be the first point of divergence between Dancer and Mojolicous::Lite).
</p><p>
So if some people here want to contrinute to the original Perl port of Sinatra, this is where it takes place: <a href="http://github.com/sukria/Dancer" title="github.com">http://github.com/sukria/Dancer</a github.com>

<p>Uh, that's a little unfair. I've been using Mojo since November last year and it from the git log you only put Dancer on github a few weeks ago.</p><p>Mojolicious::Lite is just a variant on the Mojolicious code to allow you to have apps in one file, like you have in Dancer.

This is a fork, please. Mojolicious was there long ago, I never said the opposite.<br>
But Mojolicious::Lite, it has been directly inspired by my work on Dancer. I don't blame the fork itself, afterall it's how things happen in free software.
</p><p>
But would it be difficult to quote Dancer somewhere, just in order to give a bit of credit to my work?
</p><p>
This is a fork, and an impolite one. Now, I wish good luck to the Mojolicious folks, at least this story gave me enough motivation to build up a <a href="http://dancer.sukria.net/" title="sukria.net">website for Dancer</a sukria.net>.

<p>OK, so as Sebastian has just said on Twitter that this is a "gloriously stupid comment", I'd like precise the full story so anybody who comes here can see he's altering the reality (as he <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/schwern/journal/25940" title="perl.org">previously did with Class::DBI</a perl.org>).</p><p>
Mojolicious::Lite has been a rewrite of a module named "Rocker", previously written by Viacheslav Tykhanovskyi. Viacheslav told me he was inspired by Dancer and then started to write Rocker.</p><p>
Then Sebastian came and refactored Rocker into Mojolicious::Lite.

Even if Sebastian is not aware of it, Dancer was the seed of Mojo::Lite, in the first place.
</p><p>
I have a pretty good relationship with Viacheslav, and he's as sorry as I am for all this public war Sebastian tries to run between Dancer and Mojo.
</p><p>
I won't reply to his attacks anymore, and I'd be very happy if Dancer and Mojo could live peacefully together. There is room for both projects, no need to fight, it's just useless and makes the community look childish.

Spending <a href="http://twitter.com/kraih/status/17750369399" title="twitter.com">so</a twitter.com> <a href="http://twitter.com/kraih/status/17748103497" title="twitter.com">much</a twitter.com> <a href="http://twitter.com/kraih/status/17747132556" title="twitter.com">energy</a twitter.com> in spreading hateful messages does clearly not help the Perl community to look good.</p>

I agree that posts with content are a form of marketing, and this one that I am commenting on is fine as it points at a useful module.  It's just all the meta about how we need a marketer that bothers me.  I'm fine when people talk about that and pursue hiring a marketer or whatever, but just talk about marketing is, at least to me, not helpful.

The problem with it is that it leads to even further fragmentation.  Because of the no dependencies rule we get not just another web framework - but a whole lot of new, in bulk most probably simplistic, modules that duplicate functionality of available CPAN libraries.
<p>
And once people start coding to it they will not en masse 'move to the more complete and<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...' alternatives - this never happens.   So this will stay and the simplistic nature will quickly be replaced by more complete and complex implementations and they'll become dependencies of whole lot of other libraries.
</p><p>
Of course this is not bad in any absolute sense - but it reinforces the trend that is not productive.</p>

OK - but isn't it sad that they rewrite everything? I mean coudn't they get some co-maintanance or something to make sure that the prereqs behave as they want and ship them with their code instead of writing their own versions?
<p>
I am waiting for the promised Mojo docs for a deeper analysis - but from what I've seen it has a better API than Catalyst - it looks like there was at least some effort put into designing it.  So I am not against Mojo as a whole - I am only concerned about that no-dependency policy.</p>

When the policy is 'no dependencies' - i.e. 'rewrite everything that is not in core' - then there is much chance that some of those bad things will happen.  And beside those obvious step backs - I still maintain that duplication of effort - i.e. of rewriting something in a way that is neither worse nor better - this is still sad - it means something failed in the CPAN ecosystem.

<p>There's a big difference between "installing" a module and unpacking it in a directory.  Almost anyone can do the latter.</p><p>And I can't agree with your comments comparing Mojolicious::Lite to CGI.pm.  I'm very familiar with the latter module and it doesn't, out of the box, support this:</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>#<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/foo/*<br>get '/foo/:bar' =&gt; sub {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $self = shift;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $bar&nbsp; = $self-&gt;stash('bar');<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $self-&gt;render(text =&gt; "Our<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:bar placeholder matched $bar");<br>};<br> <br>#<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/*something/foo<br>get '/(:bar)something/foo' =&gt; sub {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $self = shift;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $bar&nbsp; = $self-&gt;stash('bar');<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $self-&gt;render(text =&gt; "Our<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:bar placeholder matched $bar");<br>};</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>CGI.pm is pretty much for reading Web data, playing with cookies and building HTML.  It's not for dispatching.  Oh, and one thing I like about Mojolicious and <em>don't</em> like about Catalyst:</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt># look ma, no hashref!<br>my $bar&nbsp; = $self-&gt;stash('bar');</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>People who want to learn Web programming and maybe learn a bit of Perl may very well Mojolicious::Lite a fantastic starting point.
