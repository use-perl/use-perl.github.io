<p><p>I feel sorry for the poor fools who don't have anonymous subroutines available in their language.  I have code that has to produce "Hi" and "Lo" bandwidth links, but we won't always have both available.  If we only have one, we print that link.  If we have both, we separate the links with a pipe.  My ugly code was something like this:</p>

<pre>if ($hi) {
   $li_text .= qq'<a href="$url$hi">Hi</a>';
}
if ($hi && $lo) {
    $li_text .= ' | ';
}
if ($lo) {
    $li_text .= qq'<a href="$url$lo">Lo</a>';
}</pre>

<p>That's just ugly, so I rewrote it:</p>

<pre>
my $link = sub { $_[0]? qq'<a href="$url$_[0]">$_[1]</a>' : () };
$li_text .= join ' | ' => $link->($hi, 'Hi'), $link->($lo, 'Lo');</pre>

<p>Much nicer and easier to maintain.</p></p>

Nope.  Try a "return" in that map block.  Wow... where'd he go? {grin}

<p>Okay, but it&#8217;s still an anonymous code block being passed to <code>map</code>. A language which does not support anonymous function is unlikely to support that idiom too.</p>

I don't get the "being passed to" part of your sentence, unless you also say that <tt>for (@list) { block }</tt> "passes" an "anonymous code block" to "for", which I also cannot support.
<p>
I view the syntax of <tt>map</tt> as an entity... it has a block that evaluates for its last expression evaluated, and a list of values.  You're not "passing anything" to map, unless you view every single function and operator as "passed to".</p>

<p>To me, <code>foreach</code> is a control structure, whereas <code>map</code> is not.</p>

<p>Per the lisper&#8217;s view, <code>map</code> is a function that transforms a list by applying a function to each of its elements.</p>

<p>Per the pragmatic view, <code>map</code> is documented in <code>perlfunc</code>, whereas <code>foreach</code> is documented in <code>perlsyn</code>.</p>

No need for anonymous functions for this example. A C-ish idiom to attack this:<blockquote> <div> <tt>for ( [ Hi =&gt; $hi ], [ Lo =&gt; $lo ] ) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;$li_text<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.= qq(&lt;a href="$url$_-&gt;[1]"&gt;$_-&gt;[0]&lt;/a&gt; | ) if $_-&gt;[1];<br>}<br>substr $li_text, -3, 3, '';</tt> </div> </blockquote>(The cleaner version would have the separator and the magic numbers for its length denoted by constants.)

<p>Yes, you can do it that way, but I think the examples that both merlyn and I posted were cleaner.  Ours were more functional in nature and require less maintenance.  For example, let's say that the client wante the delimiter changed in to "&lt;-&gt;".  You now have two places in your code to change instead of one.  That final substr you use is an example of "synthetic" code (code that's used to solve a problem in the programming language rather than solving the actual problem.)  The more synthetic code in an application, the more bugs one is likely to have.</p>

<p>And a cleaner version would <em>not</em> have both a separator and magic numbers.  One or the other, please.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2005-04-18T23:41:54</h3>
<p>Maybe I didn&#8217;t make myself clear about the constant. I meant that it would define the separator in a constant and its length in a derived constant so that you&#8217;d only need to change one of them. Then all I need to change is the separator constant and the final string shortening call automatically works as intended.</p>

<p>As far as the functional nature of the idioms you and merlyn wrote is concerned, that&#8217;s true, but I didn&#8217;t claim otherwise. I did say the code I wrote was C-ish, remember? It&#8217;s not the way I would solve this problem in Perl &#8211; I&#8217;d definitely go for some variation on the <code>join</code> theme. But if I were working in a language with no support for anonymous functions, the simplest solution would likely look something like the Perl I wrote here.</p>

<p>You know, after the monstrosity I had to write to emulate this in C, I think I&#8217;d stick with your ugly initial version and avoid duplication simply by putting the format string in a constant. Although the C version would have more duplication than the link building due to all the malloc scaffolding. Ugh. C&#8217;s not the language to do heavy string lifting with (unless you really need to go <em>fast fast <strong>fast</strong> </em>).</p>

Err, what I forgot to say: obviously, anonymous functions <em>are</em> very useful. You just didn&#8217;t pick a good example.

join() is one of those functions I always wind up reimplementing when I have to work on proprietary, non-perl code.  it's *that* handy<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

<p>That reminds me of one VBScript job I had where I was so irritated by its awful array manipulation functions that I wrote push(), pop(), shift(), unshift() and sort().  My coworkers were mystified by my code, but they admitted that it worked well.</p>
