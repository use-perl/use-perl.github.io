<div class="span8">
<p><P><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/timestamp-4-1.html">Straight from the docs for the latest version</a>, regarding the initialization and updating of timestamp columns (emphasis their's, snarky parentheticals mine):</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a DEFAULT value is specified for the first TIMESTAMP column in a table, it is not ignored (gosh, that's handy). The default can be CURRENT_TIMESTAMP or a constant date and time value.</li>
  <li>DEFAULT NULL is the same as DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP for the <em>first</em> TIMESTAMP column (huh?). For any other TIMESTAMP column, DEFAULT NULL is treated as DEFAULT 0.</li>
  <li>... snip ...</li>
</ul>

<P>It goes on like that, with a number of curious statements which make me wonder if the developers sat in a back room drinking cheap whiskey and making up "features" to foist on people.</p>

<p>The second bullet point is scary.  Why the hell would I want to have "DEFAULT NULL" treated as "DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"?  I want my database to do what I tell my database to do, damn it.  What's worse, they refer to the <em>first</em> timestamp column.  Ignoring the fact that the MySQL is drifting even further from the relational model (sets aren't ordered!), there's a very practical issue here.  If I drop and recreate a table, my table's behavior can change dramatically if I reorder my columns.  That should <em>not</em> be relevant.</p>

<p>And for other timestamp columns, DEFAULT NULL is treated as DEFAULT 0?  Why?  This doesn't make a damned bit of sense to me.  It also worries me given <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Adrian/journal/32627">Adrian's post on a similar MySQL issue</a>.</p>

<p>Reading through the comments for those docs is also "real fun".</p>

<p>MySQL:  Transactions, check.  Triggers, check.  Foreign keys, check.  Still a toy?  Check.</p></p>

<p><blockquote> <div><em>Why the hell would I want to have "DEFAULT NULL" treated as "DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"?</em></div> </blockquote>

<p>Because I certainly don't believe that all of my middleware has the exact same time, and I want a single canonical reference for the time I added a row to the database.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm too lazy always to include <code>now()</code> every time I insert a row into the table, and I'm definitely too lazy to write a stored procedure to insert the row or a trigger to set those values, but the fewer magical things the middleware has to do and the more magical things the database can do consistently, I consider a good thing.</p>

I can't say you've provided a convincing argument for why a DEFAULT NULL gets current timestamp or 0 depending on it's position.<br><br>If the the designer has said they want an empty timestamp to default to NULL, the value should be NULL, not whatever the database decides to do with it.<br><br>What if my first timestamp column in a table represents the date that I shipped an order to a customer and the second represents the date it was ordered? If I haven't shipped it to the customer yet<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... ? That's one heck of an odd implementation detail to work around. Yes, it is documented but it doesn't Do What I Told it Too which is more important than Do What I Mean.<br><br>

<p>True.  Likewise, I didn't provide a convincing argument why butterscotch is disgusting, but at least I can defend <em>that</em> position.</p>

<p>Yes, that is a good argument showing that it makes perfect sense to use <code>DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</code>.</p>

<p>However, am I missing something, or did you fail to even notice that the point in question is about <strong> <code>DEFAULT NULL</code> </strong> (which is being treated <em>the same as</em> <code>DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</code> for some bizarre reason (except when it&#8217;s not))?</p>

<p>You're right; I did fail to notice that.  Somehow I turned it around in my head so that it meant "When you insert no value into this column," which is <em>completely</em> different.</p>

The ability to specify a useful default for timestamp columns is newish.  The old behavior was to treat the first timestamp column with DEFAULT NULL as what can now be expressed as DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP.  If you didn't like it, you used datetime as the column type instead of timestamp.<br>



<h2>death to timestamps</h2>

Yeah, I've worked with a big pile of MySQL-based software that uses timestamps instead of date times all over the place, and then does crazier things.  The first timestamp, for example, is used as a last modification time, except it's displayed to the users as something more like a created/modified-in-certain-way time, meaning that if you modify other fields, you have to modify that one to explicily<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/not/ change.<br><br>Sure, it's a sign of programmer failure, but it's yet another case where MySQL makes easy things easy and horrible things probable.
