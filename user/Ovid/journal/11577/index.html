<p><p>Well, I'm not sure, but the presentation went moderately well.  Unlike my <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Ovid/journal/7842">last presentation</a> which I had to throw together at the last minute, I actually had time to prepare for this one.  As it turns out, a large portion of my audience had not used databases, so much of what I put together was lost on them.  I don't think there was any way of communicating SQL management strategies to people who didn't know what a  SELECT statement was.  Fortunately, I made sure to throw in lots of interesting pictures so they still had something to look at.</p>

<p>Jeff Zucker and Randal Schwartz both commented that they thought the info was good, but I think I still need more practice, so I'll start working on another one.  I think that Logic Programming in Perl might be interesting, though I can see people's eyes glazing over at that one, too.  In any event, the CPAN has what appears to be a nice <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/SALVA/Language-Prolog-Yaswi-0.04/Yaswi.pm">SWI Prolog</a> interface that I can use.  I'll just need to come up with some real world examples.  Who's going to care about the N-Queens problem?  Maybe picking airline routes or something.  Suggestions welcome.</p>

<p>Things I learned ...</p>

<ul>
  <li>I talk too fast</li>
  <li>Don't just repeat the question, rephrase it</li>
  <li>Transition slides with no content are useless</li>
  <li>Searching Google Images with the safe content filter off is too distracting</li>
  <li>The GIMP rocks!</li>
  <li>Alzabo and SPOPS were probably better examples than Class::DBI and Tangram</li>
</ul>

<p>And finally:  the weirdest coincidence.</p>

<p>The seeds of this talk were planted over a year ago when I attended a Ward Cunningham talk about Extreme Programming.  In the talk, I asked how he handled rapid database development and the need to refactor the database along with the code.  It's all too easy to create a denormalized database so I was thinking that the entire data model would need to be created up front.  While I don't remember his answer, I left with a lot of questions and my talk last night was my answer to those questions.  The coincidence lies in the fact that I was the opening act and the headliner was none other than Ward Cunningham with Brian Ingerson.  I didn't know this prior to volunteering the presentation, so I was astonished.</p></p>
