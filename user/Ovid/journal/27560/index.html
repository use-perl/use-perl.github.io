<h2>Objectivist?</h2>

It seems that what is being labeled as Libertarian is more like Objectivism.<br><br>I do like the Anarchist/Libertarian short take.

<p>Agreed.  I took the Libertarian/Communist description directly from the article.  The author does to a certain extent seem to confuse objectists with libertarians though the former might be considered a subclass of the latter.</p>

<p>Still, libertarians and objectivists do share many qualities.  The most pervasive is the inability to recognize <a href="http://www.apotheon.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1073292665&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=8&amp;" title="apotheon.com">the cost of information</a apotheon.com>.  Information costs and the attendent market distortions are frequently omitted from economic models.  It's like planning a rocket launch and ignoring wind shear.</p>

The term "anarchist" gets applied to a lot of different things.  As an anarchist communist whose views on human nature were largely shaped by my experiences as a worker in various companies, I think your description of "anarchist"s seems directed at someone other than me.  But I'm not sure what your point is.<br>

<p>It was a joke.  Like many jokes, its humor stems from a bit of reality being tossed in there.</p>
