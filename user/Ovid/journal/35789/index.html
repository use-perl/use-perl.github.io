<div class="span8">
<p><p>Three years ago (my god, has it been that long already?), Richard Freytag approached me about writing a proper parser for AI::Prolog.  I was really excited about this project at the time.  I had, regrettably, implemented an ad-hoc parser for the language.  Prolog's simplicity made this a simple task, but regrettably, it wasn't easy to implement math.  Eventually, I hit on the idea of writing <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/AI-Prolog/lib/AI/Prolog/Parser/PreProcessor/Math.pm">a math pre-processor</a> which could do thing like convert this math statement:</p>

<pre>Answer is 9 / (3 + (4+7) % ModValue) + 2 / (3+7).</pre>

<p>Into this Prolog equivalent:</p>

<pre>is(Answer, plus(div(9, mod(plus(3, plus(4, 7)), ModValue)), div(2, plus(3, 7)))).</pre>

<p>However, I also wanted to add <a href="http://www.amzi.com/manuals/amzi7/pro/ref_dcg.htm">definite clause grammars</a> to my Prolog and while I could add another pre-processor, the work seemed daunting and I never got around to it.  When Freytag offered to write the parser, I was ecstatic as that meant I could easily extend the grammar.</p>

<p>It didn't work.  Well, it did work and it worked very well, but the Prolog ran <em>backwards</em>.  Freytag's work was brilliant, but I wasn't smart enough to fix it.  In pure declarative programming, running backwards would be fine (just try that with Perl, eh?), but Prolog isn't pure.  It has cuts (!), asserts (assert/1), retracts (retract/1), and many other "extra logical predicates" which alter the behavior in such a way that a the order in which a program runs is extremely important.  Math, regrettably, is also extra logical.  It runs one direction only.</p>

<p>Consider this, for example:</p>

<pre>  convert(Celsius, Fahrenheit) :-
       Celsius is (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9.</pre>

<p>If you issue the query <tt>convert(Celcius, 32).</tt>, you get the result "0", as you would expect.  Unfortunately, <tt>convert( 0, Fahrenheit )</tt> gives you an "unbound variable" error.</p>

<p>Today on Lambda The Ultimate, I saw a link to <a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/Prolog/Arithm/arithm.pdf">pure Prolog declarative math</a> (pdf).  No cuts.  No introspection.  No asserts or retracts.  Just pure logic programming.  This means that the following failures in "out of the box" Prolog won't be failures:</p>

<pre>?- plus(A,B,C).
ERROR: plus/3: Arguments are not sufficiently instantiated
?- plus(A,B,5).
ERROR: plus/3: Arguments are not sufficiently instantiated
?- plus(5,A,B).
ERROR: plus/3: Arguments are not sufficiently instantiated</pre>

<p>Despite <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=143405">some people's belief that Perl maps to the human brain better than Prolog</a> (a not uncommon belief, I might add), when handling relational data, Prolog trounces Perl.  (Yes, yes, Perl often trounces Prolog, too.  There is no "best" language).</p></p>
