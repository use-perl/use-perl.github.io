<p><p>Here's what bites me and many other CPAN authors:  forgetting to list that <em>one</em> dependency.  Maybe you think it's core.  Maybe you forgot to add a module you threw in at the last moment.  Maybe some dumbass named Ovid forgets to take out the call to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Data-Dumper-Simple/">Data::Dumper::Simple</a> that he threw in there for debugging (yeah, that was embarrassing).</p>

<p>I'm trying to think of the best ways to handle this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a <tt>./Build testclean</tt> target which runs the tests against a pristine copy of Perl, if it exists, installing the needed modules listed in <tt>Build.PL</tt> or <tt>Makefile.PL</tt>.  This would be expensive and need to be rebuilt repeatedly.</li>
  <li>At the end of every test, report <tt>%INC</tt> and at the end of the test run, report every module in <tt>%INC</tt>, which version is was released with and if it's not core, check if it's listed as a dependency.</li>
  <li>Ignore it.</li>

<p>While that sounds like a fantastic idea (I already have Parallels on my MacBook, along with Vista), I suspect it's a bit more than most developers are looking for, or are able to implement.  Ease of use is of paramount importance here.  If we can get an 80% solution with 20% of the work, that would be a huge win.</p>

<p>Of course, if you want to write the code which automates setting all of this up, I'm sure folks would consider it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I use Parallels virtual machines for smoke-testing CPAN.  I'm normally happy to tell people how to get at a guest account on those VMs if they want to test their modules against minimal installs of various versions of perl.

<p>So far, I've given access to everyone who's asked.  I'd probably only refuse for those very few people who I know abuse community resources.  The minimal barrier to entry is that you have to email me to get access.</p>

Perhaps this could be done with a special test target, but I think this is a brillant solution.

<h2>Why not list core modules as dependencies?</h2>

It breaks stuff to list core modules as dependencies. I forget what. Wish I didn't. Sorry.

For Debian's <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/dh-make-perl" title="debian.org">dh-make-perl</a debian.org>, up to the currently-shipping version, we had a manually specified list of core modules. The problem is, this list changes with time. If you take a look at <a href="http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-perl/trunk/dh-make-perl/dh-make-perl?op=diff&amp;rev=0&amp;sc=0" title="debian.org">this commit</a debian.org>, you will agree (I hope!) that automatic querying makes much more sense than hard-coding lists.

I agree this would be a nice author test, but it's is much harder than just using %INC.<br><br>1) Testing for core status<br>--&gt; For what version of perl?

I think since there is no META.yml attribute which is reliable and agreed upon, this needs PPI.<br><br>2) %INC has all loaded modules, not just distributions. So you need to check only modules loaded by the modules in the distribution-to-be-tested directly.<br>--&gt; This requires that you determine all modules in the current distribution.

Or something like Module::ScanDeps (fragile) or a much better implementation using PPI.<br><br>3) If our module loads 'Foo::Bar' and there is a declared dependency on 'Foo', one needs to figure out whether 'Foo::Bar' is part of the 'Foo' distribution. I can't think of a way to test this without involving a CPAN client. Also, one level down, if the Foo-distro depends on a distro which includes Foo::Bar, should our module depend on that directly or is the dependency on 'Foo' enough?<br><br>I think this sort of module would only do good if it had a robust implementation and that is probably very hard.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Steffen

Given a distribution to be tested, you need to know the minimum perl version it's compatible with to be able to USE Module::CoreList at all.

<p>I thought it was a given that checking the dependency list is done <em>before</em> you upload to PAUSE. This sort of test would be useless if it ran <em>after</em> your distro ship had sailed.</p>

<p>How touchingly naive<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  It's amazing how many people don't bother checking.  Aside from plain and simple coding errors, undeclared dependencies are one of the most common problems with modules.  It's hard to blame the authors though.  If you use LWP::UserAgent every day it's hard to remember that it's not core.  Even harder to remember is that Storable, for instance, hasn't always been in core and that merely declaring it as a pre-requisite can make your code work on older perls.</p>

<p>No, what I meant is that I thought it was a given that any automatic depency list checker would be for use before, not after, uploading.</p>

<p>If anyone thought people always checked the list themselves, we wouldn&#8217;t even be having this discussion&#8230;</p>

<h2>Test::Prereq</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2007-07-31T16:56:28</h3>
I used to have this problem quite a bit, but then I wrote Test::Prereq. That module runs all the tests and collects module information along the way. It then removes the core modules, looks in Makefile.PL (or Build.PL) to see what is listed. Everything left over is something you should have listed as a dependency.



<h2>If you look over to the Linux distributions...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/GunnarWolf/">GunnarWolf</a> on 2007-07-31T22:03:41</h3>
We in <a href="http://www.debian.org/" title="debian.org">Debian</a debian.org> have several tools for building our packages in bare environments - That is, tools that set up an <em>essential</em> system, add the dependencies declared in any given package, and build the package in it. My personal favorite is <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/cowdancer" title="debian.org">Cowbuilder</a debian.org>, heavily based on <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/pbuilder" title="debian.org">Pbuilder</a debian.org>.<br>For something closer to The Perl Way, we have good ol' dirty <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/dh-make-perl" title="debian.org">dh-make-perl</a debian.org>, which takes a CPAN package, extracts -among other things- its dependencies, and builds (or at least, tries to - But if it doesn't, we treat it as a bug) a Debian package out of it. <br>Anyway, I hope we can meet at YAPC::EU - I'm <a href="http://vienna.yapceurope.org/ye2007/talk/513" title="yapceurope.org">giving a talk on integrating Perl in Linux distributions</a yapceurope.org>. If the topic looks interesting to you, you are welcome to <a href="http://gwolf.org/soft/integrating_perl_in_distro/integrating_perl_in_distro.pdf" title="gwolf.org">look at my paper as well</a gwolf.org>.



<h2>In Debian and Ubuntu, pbuilder (and cowbuilder)...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/GunnarWolf/">GunnarWolf</a> on 2007-08-13T16:11:43</h3>
I guess similar packages will exist for other distributions - pbuilder sets up a minimal chrooted system with only the base packages for the OS, and builds Debian packages in them, satisfying the build-dependencies each package declares and thus ensuring that they are _buildable_ with nothing but what is declared (i.e. no dependencies already present in the maintainer's build environment are skipped).<br>Now, this approach is good for <em>building packages</em>, not necessarily for testing Perl modules' completeness. Of course, in the Debian pkg-perl team, one of our policies is to die if the build process does not pass <tt>make test</tt> - but as several examples in this thread show, that might not be enough for comprehensive testing.
