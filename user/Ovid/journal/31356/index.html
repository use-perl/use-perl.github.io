<p><p>With the exception of contracting work, three out of the last four companies I've worked for have run out of money (that's the price you pay for gambling with startups).  So I chose my current position based upon stability.</p>

<p>Oops.</p>

<p>No, they're not out of money.  They're out of Nottingham.  March 10, 2007 is the official last day of the office here.  We're all being offered the chance to transfer to the new offices in a business park a few miles west of London.</p></p>

That must be a tad.... annoying...<br><br>All the best.

<p>If I recall you once enquired about a position at my employer. The person we did hire, did good work and was made redundent for no sensible reason, so perhaps it's a good job you didn't persue the position here afterall. Mind you the person we did hire also has a reputation of getting laid-off through no fault of his own.</p>

<p>I don't recall the company, to be honest; there were only three I interviewed with.  One was taking its time (until I told them I had an offer), one was trying to make an offer but needed more capital and my current employer made a good offer and was willing to make it happen.  Outside of those three, I don't know who you might be referring to.</p>

<p>That being said, I feel terribly awkward about my situation.  If I can't afford to move to the outskirts of London, it's not going to look good on my CV.  (And my employer does read my blog, I might add).</p>

<p>The position I was referring to is some time ago, while you were in the US. If your employer is reading this now: "we're not trying to steal Ovid now...!"</p>

<p>Good luck with what ever happens!</p>
