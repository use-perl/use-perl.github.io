<p><p>I have no idea what's going on, and it's stumped me for two hours.  I have an HTML form on a page with multiple tables and three <tt>&lt;input type="image"...&gt;</tt> buttons and for the life of me, I can't submit anything.  I've run the page through tidy, I've typed in the URL directly (to ensure that everything runs if the data is submitted), I've restarted Apache and restarted my box.  I've also played multiple tricks with moving the form tags and restructuring everything.  Nothing seems to work.  IE hangs and running it through Mozilla reveals that Mozilla's "info" box shows the form is there.  The submit buttons just won't work.  I'll figure it out, but it makes for an agonizing day trying to pick apart the client side when I have sweet code running on the server side :(</p>

<p>On the plus side, I've been doing some more work with Logic Programming in Perl.  <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=186362">adrianh</a> came up with <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=193649">some beatiful code</a> that pretty much negated all of my work on <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=189943">AI::Perlog</a>.  Since his work seems so much cleaner, I'm happily dumping everything that I did to reimplement things with his code.  My only problem with his code is the interface, but since it's just a proof of concept, I can hardly complain.  Maybe, just maybe, I'll actually get something put together.</p></p>

<h2>Don't know if this is the case here...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Sifmole/">Sifmole</a> on 2003-01-14T12:58:17</h3>
but I have run across similar issues with the JS DOM getting confused when something is buried inside "too many" nested tables.  I never could figure out a way to fix it and had to avoid the issue instead.
