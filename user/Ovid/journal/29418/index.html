<p><p>You know, I was all proud of how <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-CGI/">Class::CGI</a> was nice and easy to use and made untainting a breeze (due to its "once and only once" philosophy), but curiosly, I had never run any tests under taint mode.  Today I just did.  It blew up, badly.  The following snippet illustrates the problem:</p>

<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl -T

use Module::Load::Conditional qw(check_install);
check_install( module => 'Data::Dumper' );</pre>

<p>Which blows up with:</p>

<p><tt>Insecure dependency in eval while running with -T switch at /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.7/Module/Load/Conditional.pm line 215, &lt;GEN0&gt; line 12.</tt></p>

<p>Seems <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Load-Conditional/">Module::Load::Conditional</a> reads lines in from your modules and evals "VERSION" lines to get the version.  This is a showstopper for <tt>Class::CGI</tt>.  Working on a bug report and a fix now.  All of the code appears to assume that VERSION information is all on one line, so while that is not always correct, if I use that as my baseline, I can at least hope that I won't make things worse.</p>

<p>Note that the same security hole appears to be present in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-InstalledVersion/">Module::InstalledVersion</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/ExtUtils-MakeMaker/lib/ExtUtils/MM_Unix.pm">ExtUtils::MM_Unix</a>.</p></p>

Dude, EVERYTHING does it that way, because that, SOMEHOW, became the required way to do things.<br><br>I mentioned at OSCON there was an obviously DOS attack against PAUSE right?<br><br>You just found it.<br>

<p>I remember your comments and I remember you wouldn't elaborate, which seemed a reasonable thing to do.  The fact that it's still not been fixed is discouraging.  Right now, I have some code which finds -- without eval -- the correct version number of about 98% of what I have installed (440 modules), but some of the edge cases it misses are pretty important ones.</p>

<p>What's worse is that while some failures are due to me learning the rather convoluted evolution of version numbers, some are due to authors being lazy and doing things like this:</p> <blockquote> <div><tt>$VERSION = sprintf("%d.%s", map {s/_//g; $_} q$Name: release-0_60-public $ =~<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/-(\d+)_([\d_]+)/)</tt></div> </blockquote> <p>That might look like a "good" lazy to some folks, but as you pointed out, if anyone ever moves to a different source control system, this could be problematic for them.  Heck, even if the author assumes that will never happen, they'll still have problems if they <em>lose</em> their repository (hard disk crashes with no backup or old backups are not unknown).</p>
