<h1>Why Was This Bill Passed?</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2006-09-30T21:50:00</h2>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>From the first paragraph of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/29/AR2006092901055.html">this Washington Post article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>With little public attention or even notice, the House of Representatives has passed a bill that undermines enforcement of the First Amendment's separation of church and state.  The Public Expression of Religion Act - H.R. 2679 - provides that attorneys who successfully challenge government actions as violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment shall not be entitled to recover attorneys fees.</blockquote>

<p>And in case you're not familiar with the First Amendment of the US Constitution, the "Establishment" clause is the very first clause:</p>

<blockquote>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</blockquote>

<p>Now I'm not going to get into the merits of attorneys recovering their fees, but why was <em>this</em> particular clause singled out for special treatment?</p>

<p>From the same article:</p>

<blockquote>A federal statute, 42 United States Code section 1988, provides that attorneys are entitled to recover compensation for their fees if they successfully represent a plaintiff asserting a violation of his or her constitutional or civil rights.</blockquote>

<p>I have no further comment.  I think this speaks for itself, but I'm hopeful the Senate won't pass this.</p></p>

<h2>Did you read about it?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2006-09-30T23:53:35</h3>
<p>It is to prevent organizations (read ACLU; which is none of those letters) from collecting attorneys fees on establishment cases. They can still get other types of monies like court costs, etc.</p>

<p>The reason? Abuse of the system.</p>

<p>I am not arguing it either way but I am no fan of the ACLU.</p>
