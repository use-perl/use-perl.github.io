<h1>New Features in HTML::TokeParser::Simple</h1>

<p><p>I just uploaded <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTML-TokeParser-Simple/">HTML::TokeParser::Simple 3.14</a> and it should be on a CPAN mirror soon.  This is a moderately important upgrade, so it should have been updated more than just .01, but who can turn down PI?</p>

<p>Change log:</p>

<pre>Added POD tests
Converted to Module::Build
All classes now state which methods they override
Carp is now only loaded on demand
peek() now allows you to peek at the next tokens</pre>

<p>I particularly like the <tt>peek()</tt> method.  This allows you to "peek" at where you are in the document without affecting the state of the parser.  This is very helpful for debugging.  <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=489637">I got the idea after suggesting it on Perl Monks</a>.</p>

<p>The feature I tried to add, but failed, was optional string overloading.  I wanted you to be able to do this:</p>

<pre>my $parser = HTML::TokeParser::Simple->new(
  string   => $html,
  overload => 1,
);

while (my $token = $parser->get_token) {
  print $token;
}</pre>

<p>That seems rather straightforward.  I was "eval"ing overload but it failed miserably because <tt>bless $token, $class</tt> was triggering the stringification.  I tried to munge the stringification method to handle this properly, but every time I did the code was getting uglier and uglier.  Part of this deals with how the <tt>as_is</tt> method is overloaded.  I also needed to ensure that I was removing overloading if a new parser was instantiated and that made it worse.  I think I know what went wrong and I think I can fix it but for now it's a feature I've left out because no one has ever asked for it.</p></p>
