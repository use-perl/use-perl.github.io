<p><p>In retrospect, I really don't want autoboxing for Perl.  It seemed like a nice hack, but until I know what problem it solves, I don't see a need for it.  The top five things I would like for Perl, however, are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A reentrant regular expression engine.  I think could actually implement a <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=318350">proper predicate logic system</a> were it not for this limitation.</li>
  <li>A clean OO model.</li>
  <li>"Defined or" (<tt>$foo // $bar; $baz //= 3</tt>) become part of the core.</li>
  <li>Method signatures (with method overloading).</li>
  <li>A built-in GUI system (preferably wxPerl).</li>
</ol>

<p>Santa got me clothes, books, and sushi cookware instead.</p></p>

<h2>Defined Or</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/triv/">triv</a> on 2004-01-03T22:24:40</h3>
<blockquote><div> <i>3. "Defined or" ($foo<nobr> <wbr></nobr>// $bar; $baz<nobr> <wbr></nobr>//= 3) become part of the core.</i> </div></blockquote><br/><br/>"Defined or" is already in 5.9.x.

<p>That makes me happy.  I heard it was going to make it into 5.10, so this is nice confirmation.  It was also, I hasten to add, the only item on the list that I thought would actually happen.</p>

1. Reetrant regexes : this isn't trivial and needs some effort to understand how the engine works overall. Volunteers welcome.
<p>2. Are you implicitly saying that the OO model of perl isn't clean ??<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
</p><p>3. Done<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p>4. Scott Walters suggested recently that making stashes tieable makes it possible to implement method overloading on method signature (for a particular class).
</p><p>5. Ain't gonna happen. Patches not welcome, for once.</p>

<p>I shan't volunteer for the re-entrant regex fix as my C-fu is weak and when we tell scary stories around the campfire, someone always brings up someone's journey into the regex engine's depths.  I'd rather perform a colonoscopy on a flatulent pachyderm.</p>

<p>It's a shame, though.  without reentrant regexes, the utility of <tt>(??{})</tt> is severely limited.  If it were fixed, we could open up an entirely new class of programming.</p>

<p>And I would never say that Perl's OO model isn't clean.  Why, I just think it's <em>oodles</em> of fun tracking down an accidentally overridden private method<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Er, IIRC the camel is a ruminant, so colonoscopy must be more difficult on them than on pachyderms.

<p>You know, I wasn't even thinking about the Camel when I wrote that.  It would have been much more funny if I had.  Phooey.</p>
