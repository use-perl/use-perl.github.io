<p><p>I often receive email from people needing help for one Perl project or another.  Usually these are things that I do not have time to help with or am not interested in.  When this occurs, if it seems appropriate, I send an email to the <a href="http://portland.pm.org">Portland Perl Mongers</a> mailing list and see if anyone wants to help out.</p>

<p>Last Wednesday, I received a cry for help from someone that I'll call "Alice".  Alice had a project that was converting a flat-file database to MySQL.  Curiously enough, the flat-file system didn't scale beyond 65,000 files (eek!).  Alice had a Perl programmer working on the project, but the programmer backed out at the last minute and somehow Alice had my email in her list of contacts.  I don't have time to help her, but I send an email to the list and quickly get a slough of email from people wanting the project.  One of the email messages read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>I'd highly recommend [Alice].  I've had her working on just such a project this week.</blockquote>

<p><b>Note:</b>  The situation with Alice has been resolved to her satisfaction.</p></p>
