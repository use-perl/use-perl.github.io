<p><p>In the past two days, someone <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/publius_ovidius/111287.html">racked up $2100.00 in charges on my Discover Card</a>.  The Discover Card fraud unit called to tell me about it and are transferring the undisputed balance to a new account.  I didn't even sign up for any anti-fraud services.  Given the bad press so many companies get for being mum about this stuff, I am very, very happy with Discover Card.</p></p>

Given that US <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/credit/cards.htm" title="ftc.gov">Consumer Protection Law</a ftc.gov> limits your liability due to fraud to $50, it behooves Discover to do as much anti-fraud investigation as they can.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...Consumer protections are a good thing!



<h2>Agreed</h2>

<p>I've had a Discover card since they first came out in the late '80s.  I agree that their fraud detection and response is very good.</p>
<p>On a couple of occasions, my card was turned down at a merchant, and when I called the 800 number later, the operator asked, "Did you make (this, that, and the other) charge?"  When I said no, their only answer was "OK, we're sending you a new card." I never even had to dispute the fraudulent charges.</p>
