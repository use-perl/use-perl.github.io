<p><p>One of our programs needs to be renamed and there's a variety of places in one of our systems (written in Perl) where it needs to be changed.  Our newest programmer (and a good friend of mine) piped up and said "If you want, I can write a Python program to go through and fix your Perl code!"</p></p>


<hr/>



<h2>And the Program Is?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2003-05-01T18:55:46</h3>
<tt>os.execlp( "perl", "-pi.bak", "-e",<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... ) </tt>

I say let him.
<p>
Right about the time you start running <tt>perl -spi.bak -e<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</tt>, he'll realize that he's starting to solve a more general problem and start thinking about a class hierarchy.
</p><p>
Right about the time <tt>perl -spi.bak</tt> finishes, he'll get a brilliant flash of inspiration and start looking at some existing frameworks to make this program easier to write.
</p><p>
In two days' time, he'll realize that all of the existing frameworks are either too abstract, abstracted in the wrong ways, or solving problems in a completely different and totally unrelated domain.  He'll start to think deeply about the problem he's trying to solve.
</p><p>
About a week later, he'll have the first sketches of a new framework for writing Python programs that troll about and fix programs in practically any programming language (gotta love that this framework supports plugins at multiple levels!).
</p><p>
A month or so after that, he'll have version 0.25 or so ready to announce to the Python list, and he'll start writing some documentation to <i>prove</i> that this framework is easier to learn, easier to use, faster and more reliable than any other framework.  Oh, and he'll start integrating a web-based application server into it.
</p><p>
A few months later, when you're running <tt>perl -spi.bak</tt> for about the twelfth time, he'll return to the original problem that you needed to fix in your Perl programs <i>three months ago</i>.

<p>How long before he discovers that he can embed an interactive fiction parser and still keep the program "mathematically provable"?  That was always my favorite step.</p>

Good point.  And no program to "fix Perl programs" will ever be complete until it contains each of the following as well:
<ol>
<li>a mail reader</li>
<li>a web browser</li>
<li>a templating language (customized to this task and totally unlike every other templating language ever created)</li>
<li>a brand new paradigm for processing XML</li>
<li>its own scripting language based on Lisp or perhaps Python</li>
<li>and a replacement "linux kernel configuration tool"</li>
</ol>
Oh, yeah -- let's not forget that this describes the <i>first</i> system.  I don't even want to imagine what the second system syndrome will do to a project like this.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>Second System</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2003-05-02T05:13:12</h3>
<p>It starts with a patch to <code>perly.y</code> to replace curly braces with Unicode whitespace characters.  You have to recompile Perl to install the program and you really don't want to know any more than that.</p>

This pleases me.

Ask for an estimate, pleeeeeaze...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
