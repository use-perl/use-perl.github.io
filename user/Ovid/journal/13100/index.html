<p><p>At my personal email account, I receive a lot of spam.  I decided to collect all of it for a week to see how much I received:</p>

<p>Number of spam:  697<br>
Total Size:  3.55 meg</p>

<p>That's a heck of a lot of spam.  I almost wonder how it can be cost effective for them, but somehow, the spammers seem to survive.</p></p>

<h2>Cost-effective</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2003-06-27T16:12:54</h3>
It's cost-effective because the costs are miniscule.  Mail out 10 million spam, and if you only get 1 buy in a million, that's 10 buys.  Ten purchases (or whatever) for a close-to-zero cost is cost-effective.

<p>That assumes that the spammers are actually the ones selling the products.  That may be.  That also may not be &mdash; it makes sense to me that the ones making money are the ones selling spamming <em>services</em>, and the people actually selling physical products are just being ripped off.</p>

<p>That's just a hunch though.  Does anyone know for sure?</p>

The freep.com article (http://www.freep.com/money/tech/mwend22_20021122.htm) on Alan Ralsky states:
<blockquote><div> <i>
Ralsky makes his money by charging the companies that hire him to send bulk e-mail a commission on sales.
</i> </div></blockquote>
I have no idea how many repeat customers he gets, or what his customer satisfaction is like.
<br>
<br>  Given the content and volume of spam in *my* inbox, I have to conclude that some people out there are dissapointed with their small, flacid penises that they got a bad mortgage rate on.
