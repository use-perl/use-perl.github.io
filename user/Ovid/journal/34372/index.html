<p><p>I realize not everyone will agree with me on this one, but here's more justification that <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2007/09/the_blue_screen_of_felony_conv.html">liberty threatening software must be open source</a>.  People are winding up with felony convictions because poorly designed software is providing evidence against them in court.</p>

<p>This is a follow up to <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2007/08/you_have_the_right_to_read_you.html">my earlier OnLamp blog entry on this topic</a>.</p></p>

What do you mean by "open source" in this context?

<p>I'm really confused as to why people are misunderstanding this.  By "open source" I mean "you're allowed to read the source code".  I'm not confusing this with free software.  I don't have a problem with companies <em>selling</em> their software or having a restrictive license, but if that software threatens my liberty or safety, I should at least have the right to make sure it's fair.</p>

I agree 100% with you then.<br><br>I think the "misunderstanding" might be that people who use the term "open source" do mean different things by it. Which is why I wanted a clarification of what "you" meant by it.<br><br>The question now is...can we get it into law? : )

<p>Sorry if my reply sounded snarky<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  You're absolutely right that people sometimes widely expand what "open source" means.  I keep forgetting that bit.</p>

I have a "snarky" filter when I read stuff.  : )

I sent an email to my Congressman advocating just this subject.

<p>I think that's a wonderful idea.  But you're right, it's crazy<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Still, I'd be excited as hell to see that happen.</p>
