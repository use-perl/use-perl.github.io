<p><p>In production code, if your <tt>SELECT</tt> statement returns more than one record and it doesn't have an <tt>ORDER BY</tt> clause, it's probably a bug.</p>

<h2>Huh?</h2>

I don't follow the logic of requiring an ORDER BY, especially if I'm just slapping some data into a spreadsheet which the PHB's can sort on their own with Excel.
<p>
And what about the performance hit?  I find that if I really need ordered data it's often better to just let Perl handle it on the client side.
</p><p>
What am I missing?</p>

<i>...if I'm just slapping some data into a spreadsheet which the PHB's can sort on their own with Excel.</i> <br> <br>For one particular project I was specifically asked *not* to sort the data prior to dumping it into Excel for that very reason.<br> <br>PHBs love to sort their spreadsheets<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>Not quite</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/VSarkiss/">VSarkiss</a> on 2004-06-16T19:20:05</h3>
<p>I think what you really want to say is "if your program <em>implicitly</em> depends on the order of rows without <em>explicitly</em> using an ORDER BY clause, it's definitely a bug."</p>
<p>I rarely use ORDER BY -- except when I need it.  The trick is to know the difference.</p>



<h2>Opposite View</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/phillup/">phillup</a> on 2004-06-16T19:22:55</h3>
I have almost the opposite view.<br> <br>When I get involved, it is because the problem requires data munging that the db schema doesn't make easy.<br> <br>The data gets aggregated, munched, crunched and gyrated thru so many hoops... that it makes no sense to sort until the data is being output.<br> <br>No need to tax the db for that, not when the delivery order (from the db) is not significant.<br> <br>On the other hand... yeah, simple grab and display type of things... should have <i>some</i> order imposed upon them.<br> <br>And, my final results always do. I just may not have the db do it...



<h2>Hmmm</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vek/">vek</a> on 2004-06-16T19:33:05</h3>
Not sure I agree with you.  It *might* be a bug depending on what you're doing or expecting.  Then again, it might not.<br> <br>Today I added some code to retrieve email addresses from a table.  The order in which the rows are returned to me is irrelevant.  I'm not using the data to display on a report or on a webpage, I'm just sending out emails.<br> <br>So, does my code have a bug?  Maybe, but I'm pretty sure it's got nothing to do with the fact that I didn't use an <code>ORDER BY</code><nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
