More smart people working on high-profile Perl projects helps everyone. Will you also be traveling for Bricolage training like David?

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>As for travel, there's a definite possibility of a firm maybe (bonus points to anyone who can tell me where I stole that from.)  David is obviously the first, best choice for traveling given his extensive experience in this area.  However, it's possible that time constraints may cause me to be the person.  Obviously, it's impossible to say what will happen in the future.</p>

<p>I must say that I am very happy that I'll be working on Bricolage.  It's an impressive content management system and given that it's based on open source tools is icing on the cake.</p>

The reason I ask is that I'd imagine one of the benefits of traveling would be visiting local PM groups and getting them to buy you beer. In addition to getting a bit lost (our fault) David tossed back a few the last time he was in Pittsburgh, and a great time was had by... well, at least me.

<p>So if you're ever in Pittsburgh...</p>
