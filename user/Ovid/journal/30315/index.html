<h2>Don't feel too bad</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Mr. Muskrat/">Mr. Muskrat</a> on 2006-07-17T15:29:03</h3>
I think it's an ugly interface too.



<h2>Awkward truth</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/n1vux/">n1vux</a> on 2006-07-17T16:24:03</h3>
If no-one tells him the truth, he'll never learn better design, or to avoid design.

<p>The Reg's banner itself is kind of classy, but the headline layout is odd and quirky at best. I'm sure their advertisers like the brassy-ness of the ad borders, but it just makes it easier for me to ignore them.  Althought the flow-around the central display add on stories is annoying. And to headlines DE-emphasized on a roll-over is just WRONG.</p>



<h2>The interface is bad...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2006-07-17T17:22:09</h3>
And he should be told...



<h2>Happened to me Too</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Shlomi Fish/">Shlomi Fish</a> on 2006-07-17T18:59:52</h3>
<p>
I wrote <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TOWTF/" title="shlomifish.org">"The One with the Fountainhead"</a shlomifish.org> which is a Friends' episode that parodies the book "The fountainhead by Ayn Rand". Now, one day I came to an Israeli Group of Linux Users meeting, and met there a girl whom I only knew from the Internet until then.
</p>

<p>
We started talking and then she mentioned that she encountered a parody of the Fountainhead in her web-crawling. I asked her "Oh! Modelled around a Friends episode?" and she said "Yes! It was one of the most horrid things I read recently.".
</p>

<p>
So I told her without a lot of thinking "Well, I wrote it.". As it turns out she has neither read the Fountainhead nor watched any Friends episode. Most of the people who have read it afterwards liked what I wrote, and someone even liked it without having watched Friends first.
</p>

<p>
Just so the girl in question won't be in an entirely bad light, she's really a smart person, we've become good friends, and she's also a Linux chixor, which is also cool. She did like other stories I wrote better, and she also ended up reading a lot of stuff by Ayn Rand.
</p>

<p>
In any case, these things happen. A person should be honest and sincere, and not always try not to say things that may offend the other person. BTW, how do you like the UK so far?
</p>

<p>Oh, yes.  I got an earful.  Of course, it also makes perfect sense how they shot themselves in the foot over that, but it's possible I heard a bit more about their internal working than I should.  Let's just say that if you're going to use Bricolage, you will <em>not</em> save money with the cheapest bidder.</p>
