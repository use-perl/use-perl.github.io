<p><p>This is just in case anyone out there is searching for "Eclipse Internet Sucks" or wondering why I'm not getting any TPF or other work done.</p>

<P>My ISNP (Internet Service Non-Provider) is <a href="https://www.eclipse.net.uk/">Eclipse</a>.  Ever since I've moved to London, my Internet connection has been bad, frequently non-existent.  They tell me there are "infrastructure problems" which they hope to have resolved <em>by the end of July</em>.  In other words, I frequently have no 'net connection at home or it's so slow as to be unusable.</p>

<p>They offer two general types of residential ASDL, "Evolution" and "Home Broadband".  After a long, unhelpful phone call, tell me the problems are only on the former and since I was considering switching to the latter anyway, I did so.  That was on June 28 and I was told that the switch <em>usually</em> takes place within 72 hours.  So four days later, July 2nd, I opened a support ticket, complaining that I wasn't switched and still had virtually no Internet connection.  They gave some tips (reboot, try a new ADSL filter, move electronics, blah, blah, blah), which <em>I had already done the first time</em> -- even switching routers at one point, and told me that my switch from Evolution to Home Broadband would occur by July 5th -- in three days.  Then they closed the ticket.</p>

<p>Here it is, just over two weeks after I asked to be switched to the more reliable service.  Yesterday my ping times to Google with around 2,000 milliseconds with 40% to 60% packet loss and while I had DNS, I couldn't establish any HTTP connections.  This morning my ping times are around 130 ms, but still no HTTP connections.</p>

<p>Naturally, while I have no Internet service, they're still charging me for it.  Charging me for services that they're failing to provide while, at the same time, refusing to even hint at compensation, is galling.  I've asked outright but they said I've not called them enough.  Apparently acknowledging that I have virtually no service isn't enough to compensate me.  I have to go begging.  I just want to switch to an ISP that's not going to treat me like this, but if I do that, Eclipse is then going to charge me another &pound;50 for a connection fee which was waived if I have a one year contract with them.</p>

<p.No matter how this turns out, I'm going to get screwed and Eclipse is going to pocket my money.</p></p>
