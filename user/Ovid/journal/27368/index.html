<p><p>I have now added rooms to the world.  All items have to be created in a room (or in another item which can hold them) and rooms created are all automatically added to the world.  You can now call <tt>$world-&gt;dump</tt> to recursively dump an idented list of everything and its location.  Because rooms are a subclass of "thing", this was really easy to make happen.  Currently the world displays many behaviors similar to things but since it's a very special kind of thing, trying to have the world subclass from a thing caused some problems.</p>

<p>I really wish <tt>Class::Trait</tt> worked better.  There are some common behaviors which World and Thing share and traits would ease some design issues.</p>

<p>Off to a cartoon Halloween party.  I and some friends are going as Shaggy, Velma and Scooby Doo.  I'm Shaggy because they both said I'd be perfect for that.  Not sure how to take that :)</p></p>

<h2>Instead of Class::Trait, maybe try Perl6::Roles</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Stevan/">Stevan</a> on 2005-10-30T02:13:36</h3>
<p>
Rob Kinyon has started writing a version of roles based on Class::Role and Class::Roles (along with some learnings from my work on the Perl 6 metamodel) which is (possibly) destined for use in DBI 2.0.  It should fix all the issues Class::Trait &amp; Class::Role(s) have. You might want to give it a look. Although keep in mind that it is not feature complete, as we are waiting on p6l to clear up some details.

I guess that's better than them both thinking you would be better as Velma.
