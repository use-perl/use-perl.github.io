<h1>Proposed OSCON Talks</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2008-01-15T14:03:54</h2>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>I've just submitted my proposed OSCON talks to the BBC who will, in turn, submit them to OSCON.  In doing that, if either is accepted, the BBC will pick up the travel tab for me.</p>

<P>If you are going to OSCON or would go if you could, would either of the following two talks interest you?</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Turbo Charging Your Test Suites</dt>
  <dd>This is broken down into two sections.  The first is making your test suites run faster and the second is making your testers run faster :)</dd>

  <dt>Using Traits To Solve OO Compositional Problems</dt>
  <dd>For years programmers have tried to figure out composition in OO systems.  MI, interfaces and mixins have all been approaches with pros and cons.  I show examples of each failing and how traits get around their limitations.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The traits talk is long overdue and far more important, but I need to think of a way to spice it up better and make it more accessible.  It's for advanced programmers, but the concept itself is dirt-simple once it "clicks".</p></p>

<h2>traits, please</h2>

I'd be more interested in the "traits" talk, but I probably qualify as an "advanced" programmer, and I currently don't plan to attend OSCON this year.



<h2>Making traits accessible</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2008-01-15T16:33:06</h3>
<p>Either talk would interest me, although sadly I'm not going.</p>

<p>To make the traits talk accessible to me, you would need to give a brief introduction to each of the other methods, and those pros and cons you mentioned.  I know what multiple inheritance is, I know why Java doesn't use it and I think interfaces are grand, although in Perl (and what little C++ programming I did) I never had any problems with multiple inheritance.  I know zilch about mixins.</p>

<p>Not sure where anyone else would be in your prospective audience, but that's what it would take to make it accessible to <i>me</i>, and it's a talk I'd definitely try to go to if I was there.</p>

<h2>Traits</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Smylers/">Smylers</a> on 2008-01-15T17:46:37</h3>
<p>I will go if I can, and the traits talk is definitely something I'd like to see.</p>

<p>While making tests run faster is also of interest, I suspect I could work out for myself how to do it by reading your module's documentation.  Whereas traits, being a conceptual thing, benefit from exposition &mdash; understanding the fundamental idea, not just learning about some steps to follow.</p>

<p>Actually, the testing talk is about far more than just <tt>Test::Aggregate</tt>.  I'll be covering a lot of issues regarding databases, different aggregation strategies, refactoring, making tests easier to write (and therefore faster to write) etc.</p>

<h2>Testing, please!</h2>

I vote for the testing talk.  Your O'Reilly blog was a good intro, but I'm interested in learning more.
