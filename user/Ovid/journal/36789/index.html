<div class="span8">
<p><p>Today I spent a few hours trying to nail down a nasty bug.  Once I could replicate a small test case, what finally clued me in was an error message that looked impossible, but I remembered seeing it somewhere before.  I just couldn't remember where.  Consider this:</p>

<pre>if ($c->user || $c->authenticate(undef, 'Pips Realm')) {</pre>

<p>That was failing with "Undefined subroutine &Pips3::user called at ..."</p>

<p>Wait! What?  I didn't call a subroutine.  I called a method!  What the hell is going on?</p>

<P>For our tests, we sometimes override the authenticated user in our Pips3 application.  The core of this code looks like this:</p>

<pre>sub new {
    my ( $class, $user ) = @_;

    unless (defined wantarray) {
        croak('PIPTest::User->new($user) must not be called in void context');
    }
    my $self = bless {
        pips_user => \&Pips3::user,
        cat_user  => \&Catalyst::Request::user,
        user      => $user,
    } => $class;

    $self->_set_user($user);
    return $self;
}

sub _set_user {
    my $self = shift;

    # Get reference to sub returning the user object
    my $coderef = $self->_return_user_coderef;

    # Override Pips3::user
    {
        no warnings 'redefine';
        *Pips3::user             = $coderef;
        *Catalyst::Request::user = $coderef;
    }

    # Return the user object for convenience
    return $coderef->();
}

sub DESTROY {
    my $self = shift;
    no warnings 'redefine';
    *Pips3::user             = $self->{pips_user};
    *Catalyst::Request::user = $self->{cat_user};
}</pre>

<p>When you call 'new' with a valid user name, you get a token back and while it is in scope, you have overridden the user for the application.  I was quite happy with this code, but there's a nasty, nasty bug in it.  Once I remembered what it was, the fix was painfully obvious.</p>

<p>In Perl, when you try to pull a coderef out of a typeglob, you sometimes get some strange behavior:</p>

<pre>sub Foo::bar {'foo'}

my $code1 = *Foo::bar{CODE};
my $code2 = *Foo::no_such_subroutine{CODE};
print "$code1 $code2";
__END__
# output is something like:

foo
CODE(0x8063d94) CODE(0x8063d70)</pre>

<P>As you can see, you apparently get a code reference.  If you try to call it, though, it will give the following error message "Undefined subroutine &main::no_such_subroutine called at ...".  It even remembers the name of the non-existent subroutine!  Even stranger:</p>

<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl -l

sub Foo::bar {'foo'}
*Foo::baz = \&::baz;

print Foo->bar;
print Foo->baz;
__END__
foo
Undefined subroutine &main::baz called at test.pl line 7.</pre>

<p>Wait! What?  I didn't call a subroutine.  I called a method!  What the hell is going on?</p>

<P>Ooooooohhhhhhhh.</p>

<P>In Catalyst, when you use a plugin, your application gets the methods because it inherits them.  It doesn't install them into your namespace.  Thus, when Pips3 used the authentication plugin, my constructor above, trying to grab a reference to <tt>&amp;Pips3::user</tt>, was clearly stupid.  What's worse, when I tried to restore it, I had a non-existent method overriding an existing one!  How's that for a blunder?  The fix is simple:</p>

<pre>sub new {
    my ( $class, $user ) = @_;

    unless (defined wantarray) {
        croak('PIPTest::User->new($user) must not be called in void context');
    }
    my $self = bless {
        pips_user => Pips3->can('user'),
        cat_user  => Catalyst::Request->can('user'),
        user      => $user,
    } => $class;

    $self->_set_user($user);
    return $self;
}</pre></p>

<p>This "strange behavior" is so that you can take a reference to an as-yet-undefined sub and call it later through the reference.</p>
