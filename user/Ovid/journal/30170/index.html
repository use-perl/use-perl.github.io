<p><p>Because I'll be gone a couple of days, I wanted to get a quick alpha of the TAP parser out there.  It has no docs.</p>

<p>Here's how you use it (or you could look at the tests):</p>

<pre>  my $parser = TAP::Parser->new;
  
  $parser->parse($tap); # croaks on bad TAP
  
  print $parser->plan;  
  while ( my $test = $parser->tests ) {
      print $test->as_string;
      # or
      print $test->is_ok;        # boolean value
      print $test->ok;           # 'not ok' or 'ok'
      print $test->number;
      print $test->description;
      print $test->directive;    # TODO or SKIP data
  }</pre>
  
<p>You can download it from <a href="http://users.easystreet.com/ovid/downloads/TAP-Parser-0.01.tar.gz  ">my Website</a>.</p>

<p>It'd be awfully swell if you can feed it a bunch of TAP output so I can see what if fails on.  Kibitzing is also encouraged, though I warn you that the thing was thrown together rather hastily.</p></p>

Is this designed to target a similar niche to <tt>Test::TAP::Model</tt> and co?<br><br>By the way, I think Test::TAP::Parser would be "better" on the basis that, a) I dislike the name TAP, b) because it's ungooglable, and testing newbies (i.e. the ones who really don't need any barrier to testing) are going to find it easier to search cpan under Test as opposed to TAP, and c) there's already prior art under Test::TAP as above.

<p>I have no control over the name "TAP", so that part will not change.  Also, even though it looks like it belongs under the <tt>Test::</tt> namespace, it don't think it does, though I'm not too worried about it.  <tt>TAP::Parser</tt> has nothing to do with tests.  All it does is parse <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/petdance/Test-Harness-2.62/lib/Test/Harness/TAP.pod" title="cpan.org">the TAP protocol</a cpan.org> and gives you an OO interface for examining results.  If something doesn't parse, it throws an exception with a clear message as to why (though I should probably push errors onto a stack and report all of them at once).</p>

<p>Since it merely parses a protocol and really doesn't know about tests, that's the reason for the namespace.  The <tt>TAP::</tt> top-level namespace is already established and TAP is widely used outside of the Perl community, so there's no serious way to change the name now.</p>

<p>Oh, sure, pet peeve aside, I agree that the TAP "brand" is a good idea and should be part of the module name, sorry to overstate the case!  It looks like it could become a useful part of a testing infrastructure toolkit.</p>

<p>Searching CPAN for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=TAP%3A%3A&amp;mode=dist" title="cpan.org">
TAP</a cpan.org> only comes up with <tt>TAP.pm</tt> though (a documentation-only package describing the protocol) in the top-level namespace.  Or am I missing something?

<p> <em>TAP.pm</em> is much less than a week old, much like the TAP module plan.  It'll get there soon enough.</p>
