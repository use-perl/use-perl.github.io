<p><p>Any top-notch Perl programmers interested in working for an investment bank in London?  If so, drop me an email and I'll put you in touch.  I can't take the job but I'm trying to help out a friend.</p>

<p>(Hint:  Investment banks pay very, very well if you're willing to work in that environment.)</p>

<p>Or if you want to work for my employer (in West London) drop me a line as well.  I'll forward your CV.</p></p>

<p>I don't work for a bank and I don't work in London.</p>

<p>There are days I wonder if I need a new job and London banks always seem to want Perl people. How stressful/odd is the environment? Is it really worth it? I know you can't answer, you're not me but there are days I do wonder if I'm in the right job...</p>

<p>I suppose we all wonder. Being made redundent wasn't much fun at the time, but with hind-sight it was a good deal. Change can often be for the good and as managment keep telling us "we should embrace change" - what ever that means...</p>

<p>It's different at every bank. Some a well-known for expecting 60-hour weeks and believing that they control every waking hour (and quite a few of the non-waking ones). Others just want you to get the work done and don't care if you only work seven hours a day to do it.</p>

<p>And, of course, your stress levels will vary depending on the department you're in. If you're doing front office support on the trading floor then you'll need to get used to traders getting very testy when they ask for help on a problem that's just lost them a $1,000,000 deal. On the other hand if you're working in long-term storage capacity planning, there's hardly any stress at all.</p>

<p>So the answer to your question is: "it depends..."</p>

<p>If you have any more specific questions that you'd like answered, you might find the <a href="http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/banking-pm" title="pm.org">banking.pm</a pm.org> mailing list to be useful.</p>

You didn't used to be able to get a job at an Investment Bank unless you'd previously worked in an Investment Bank (circular, I know). Has that changed?

<p>In this particular case, I think they're willing to be flexible.  It seems to be getting harder to find decent Perl programmers.</p>
