<p><p>Back in the 1990s, during the dot-com boom, I knew people who got their first IT jobs merely knowing HTML.  It was such a new technology that knowing it was enough to get your foot in the door.  That won't work today, but I think that just demonstrating basic knowledge of HTML and SQL along with a moderate amount of Perl or Java knowledge could potentially get one an entry-level IT job. (I don't list source control because I'm rarely asked about this in interviews, but then, my interviews may not be typical)</p>

<p>What would most people consider to be the "minimum set of knowledge" today?  My list is obviously Web-centric, but that's what I know best at this point.</p></p>

<h2>What's &quot;IT&quot; ?</h2>

I'm afraid IT is far too broad a discipline these days to make a blanket statement about what skills are needed to break in.<p>

That said, a quick search on any job board indicates, "if you know Java, you're golden."</p>

<p>Fair point.  So I could narrow the question down to "what's the minimum skills you need to get an entry-level programming position?"</p>

<p>As for Java, I suspect you're right, but while I know the language (somewhat), I don't know the market other than to say "huge".</p>

Pretty much all the Java jobs I see require knowledge of particular Java libraries, not just of the language.
