<p><p>A user of one of our Web sites was talking to one of our employees about the site.  Our employee happened to mention which report the user was looking at.</p>

<tt>User:&nbsp;&nbsp;You can tell what report I look at?<br />
Emp:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.  We have a page that tracks that information<br />
User:&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll get back to you about that.</tt>

<p>This user represents a large client who has informed us that we are no longer allowed to see what reports they are using on our site for fear that we'll be able to figure out what they use for business intelligence (yeah, I can't <em>even</em> begin to think of a joke for that.  Nope.  Not at all).  We pointed out that if they have a problem with the site, we can't diagnose it unless we know what they were doing.  They were pretty stubborn and now the agreement is, if this customer has a problem with the site, the programmer must go to upper management for permission to figure out what the customer was doing.</p></p>

<p>I do hope that you are charging this client more for this "improvement". Or that you have a time based billing system that will cause better charging to all fall out in the wash. They deserve it.</p>



<h2>The Process</h2>

Ah, yes, another link in the chain of "the process", which I am slowly, but surely, being suffocated to death with here at work.



<h2>In the future</h2>

...your employees will have to have their memories wiped after helping your clients. In lieu of payment, they will deliver themselves envelopes with 19 mysterious items...
