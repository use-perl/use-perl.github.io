<div class="span8">
<p><p>I was doing a bit of C programming when I got stumped:</p>

<tt>#include &lt;math.h&gt;<br>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br>
<br>
int main(void) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;double x = 10.0, y = 3.0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;printf("%f\n", pow(x, y));<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;return (0);<br>
}</tt>

<p>I couldn't compile that with <tt>gcc</tt> because I kept getting an <tt>undefined reference to 'pow'</tt> error.  I tried explicitily declaring the function signature before <tt>main()</tt>, but that also failed.  A bit of research revealed that <tt>gcc</tt> requires I explicitly link the math library when I compile a program (by passing <tt>-lm</tt> as an argument.)</p>

<p>That seems odd.  If I explicitly link the math library, why do I need an <tt>#include &lt;math.h&gt;</tt> statement in my program?  It turns out that I don't.</p>

<tt>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br>
<br>
double pow(double x, double y);<br>
<br>
int main(void) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;double x = 10.0, y = 3.0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;printf("%f\n", pow(x, y));<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;return (0);<br>
}</tt>

<p>I can then compile that code with</p>

<tt>gcc -Wall testpow.c -o testpow -lm</tt>

<p>The above code worked fine, but it seems to me that a program should contain all of the necessary elements to get it to run.  Having to push some of this out to the compiler seems wrong.  I suspect that I've been programming Perl for so long that working with other languages is simply a foreign experience now.  This is Not Good.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>  I discovered, after a bit of research, that many people are complaining about this.  What appear to be standard C programs typed directly from book examples are mysteriously failing.  Since I am using <tt>gcc 3.2</tt>, a relatively recent compiler, I'm totally confused as to the thought process here.  C, while being relatively simple, still has a higher barrier to entry than many other languages.  Designing a compiler that further raises this barrier seems foolish.</p></p>

<h2>It's actually not that bad</h2>

<blockquote><div>I couldn't compile that with gcc because I kept getting an undefined reference to 'pow' error.
</div></blockquote>
<p>
That's right - the <code>pow</code> function is not provided by the C language. If you need
to use functionality provided by the language, you have to
add in libraries. Just like in Perl.
</p>
<blockquote><div>
  I tried explicitily declaring the function signature before main(), but that also failed.
</div></blockquote>
<p>
As it should; a function prototype doesn't actually contain any code to implement a function, it just allows you to use
that function in your code without the compiler screaming. Just like in Perl.
</p>

<blockquote><div>
A bit of research revealed that gcc requires I explicitly link the math library when I compile a program (by passing -lm as an argument.)
</div></blockquote>
<p>
Only when you're using functions provided by the math library; when you're not using functions from a given library, you don't need to link in that library. Just like in Perl.</p>

<blockquote><div>
That seems odd.  If I explicitly link the math library, why do I need an #include &lt;math.h&gt; statement in my program?  It turns out that I don't.
<br>
 double pow(double x, double y);
</div></blockquote>
<p>
All the <code>#include &lt;math.h&gt;</code> does is
give you a handy collection of prototypes; it doesn't provide any code. Since you've provided your own prototype, you don't need it.
</p>
<blockquote><div>
I can then compile that code with
<code>gcc -Wall testpow.c -o testpow -lm </code>
The above code worked fine, but it seems to me that a program should contain all of the necessary elements to get it to run.
</div></blockquote>
<p>
Well, no. You can try to use stuff from a library, but if you don't make that library available, your code isn't going to work. Just like in Perl.
</p>

<blockquote><div>
 I suspect that I've been programming Perl for so long that working with other languages is simply a foreign experience now.
</div></blockquote>
<p>
Well, as I've mentioned, this is all just like Perl...
</p>

<blockquote><div>
 Update:  I discovered, after a bit of research, that many people are complaining about this.  What appear to be standard C programs typed directly from book examples are mysteriously failing.
</div></blockquote>
<p>
Well, there are a lot of books about the language which are badly written. Just like Perl...

<p>Thank you very much!  That does clear things up.  My C, as should be readily apparent, is terribly rusty.</p>

<h2>The compilation isn't failing; it's the linking</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/md5/">md5</a> on 2003-03-11T15:26:46</h3>
It isn't the compilation stage that is failing, rather the linking phase. For instance, try the following (it should work):<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; gcc -c -o test.o test.c<br> <br>You'll end up with a compiled object file 'test.o' from your source file 'test.c'.<br> <br>Then, the following linking command will fail without the -lm:<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; gcc -lm -o test test.o
