<p><p>Yesterday my Apache2 installation went swimmingly.  Not a hitch.  Then I tried mod_perl 2.0.  Three tests were failing and it appeared to be segfaulting, but try as I might, I couldn't get it to generate a core dump.  I installed anyway just to see what was up and created a small Apache::Registry script and it worked fine.  Then it was time for Apache::Request.</p>

<p>I've had problems with Apache::Request before, but this time it was hell.  I started as a normal user.  No luck.  I did it as root.  No luck.  I did it as various combinations of the two, running as nobody, tearing down, rebuilding, tearing down, rebuilding, etc.  No luck.</p>

<p>This morning I'm starting from scratch.  Seems I had a slightly older version of Apache2, so I removed the old version completely and am now recompiling from scratch.  We'll see how it goes.  It's never been a smooth install, but this is the absolutely worst I've faced with it.</p>

<p>Combine all of this with the fact that I'm starting to learn German and <em>my head hurts</em>.</p></p>
