<p><p>Well, we can't find anymore bugs.  We have known limitations, but no known bugs.  The CTO is heading to the airport and we've shipped a bunch of machines to California.  I'll be on call all weekend to handle the inevitable patches that will be needed, so we're not out of the woods yet.</p>

<p>My fellow Perl programmer has taught me gobs about tests and there is simply no way we could have gotten this far without them, or him.  Surprisingly, this is my first Perl big project that's not Web related, despite the fact that I've been programming Perl for about 3 years.</p>

<p>Tests:  859</p>

<p><strong>Random:</strong>  I was shooting Pool last night, when a complete stranger with a ringing cell phone walked up to my friend Lisa and said "Hey, can you answer my cell phone for me and, if it's Louise, tell her I'm not here?"  Lisa answered, listened, and said "Davilah?"  Apparently, Davilah is a friend of hers and, by sheer coincidence, happened to be the person calling, even though Lisa didn't know the owner of the cell phone and he didn't know who was calling him.</p></p>

<h2>Congrats</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-06-28T07:05:34</h3>
It's been really amazing watching you from afar do this project, and congratulations are definitely in order. Sometimes I think a really short deadline is a great thing - if only to teach you to push yourself to your limits (and find out what those limits are!). Of course now you get to ask for bonus holiday time<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)



<h2>WROK</h2>

You work too hard!  Go space out, drink beer, and read
back issues of <a href="http://www.suck.com/" title="suck.com">Suck</a suck.com>, or play Tetris or something!  Also television.  TELEVISION is IMPORTANT!
