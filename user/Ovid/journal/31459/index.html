<div class="span8">
<p><p>To kill or not to kill, that is the question.<br/>
Whether 'tis more profitable in the wallet<br/>
To declare war for outrageous reasons,<br/>
Or to take arms against a sea of Muslims,<br/>
And by killing, end them.  To suffer peace<br/>
No more; and by a peace to say we end<br/>
The uncertainty of a thousand unspent freedoms<br/>
That man is heir to -- 'tis a consumption<br/>
Some politicians wish.  To have peace,<br/>
And with peace, perchance to dream.  Ay, there's the rub,<br/>
For with peace what dreams may come,<br/>
When we have given over our liberties<br/>
Which must give us uncertainty.  There's the vision<br/>
That makes security such an ephemeral thing.<br/>
For who would bear the danger and risks of dignity,<br/>
Th'leader's vision, the prophet's hope,<br/>
The pangs of yearning to be free, the law's concern,<br/>
The insolence of aspiration and the spurious<br/>
belief that sovereignty is worthwhile,<br/>
When he himself might suffer enlightenment,<br/>
By mere contemplation?  Who would this uncertainty bear,<br/>
To worry and to fret under a dangerous light,<br/>
But the dread of those we have provoked,<br/>
The unknown humans who provoke us in turn,<br/>
And no reconciliation will be returned,<br/>
And makes us bear the hate we have,<br/>
Rather than to acknowledge the heart of others?<br/>
Thus conscience does make fools of us all,<br/>
And the stalwart cry of resolution,<br/>
Covers over the pale cast of thought,<br/>
And enterprises of loudness and action<br/>
With this regard turn morality aside,<br/>
And lose the name of decency.</p></p>

<p>I can't tell if you misspelled "Soliloquy" in the title deliberately or if it was just a typo.</p>
<p>If it was deliberate, I don't get it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>:-)</code> </p>

This is both hillarious and excellent.<br><br>How shall I credit you when I send this link to others (I won't send the text itself without further permission)? Ovid? Curtis Poe? Curtis "Ovid" Poe?

<p>I'm glad you like it.  Thanks for the compliment!  Curtis "Ovid" Poe is how I usually like to be credited for writing.  And I'd send them to <a href="http://publius-ovidius.livejournal.com/213755.html" title="livejournal.com">http://publius-ovidius.livejournal.com/213755.html</a livejournal.com>.  They can actually comment in that one, if they like (not that many would read it.  Poetry is something plenty of folks don't care for).</p>

A few of my friends would like this because they're theatre people, a few others would like it because of their interest in politics, and one or two would like it for both of the above reasons.

<blockquote> <div><em>Poetry is something plenty of folks don't care for.</em></div> </blockquote>

<p>Most so-called poetry on the Internet isn't.  It's usually a jumble of tired images, poor and obvious rhymes (if any), and the limping, lurging meter of a zombie three-legged race.</p>

<p>(Of course, I consider Hamlet free verse, but I'm not talking about this piece in the previous paragraph.)</p>
