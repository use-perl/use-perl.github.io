<p><p>Well, I got another phone call.  I was expecting one, but not welcoming it.  I live in a building with four apartments and a communal washer and dryer.  I put a sign on the washer letting people know that they could toss my clothes on the table next to the dryer and then I headed into work.  There are a couple of serious issues that have completely screwed up their cash balancing.</p>

<p>I'm in a brain fog trying to read code that I can't remember.  I go on to the next section of code and can't remember the code that came before it.  Then, to compound things, I've found a bug in GVIM that sometimes inserts the contents of the buffer when I'm not expecting it.  I didn't notice that and my latest code revision failed because of that.</p>

<p>Our CTO is flying back tomorrow, but I think that's a mistake because he should be there until this entire thing is nailed down.  The next bug they find, they'll just stare at the register and wind up calling us here in Oregon rather than turn to him and ask for help.  Oh, and our CVS isn't updating properly.  When it rains ...</p>

<p>Our customer had his back against the wall, was rushed and, reasonably, his specifications were also rushed.  Planning out good specifications takes time and when you only have three weeks to work on something that should properly take several months, it's understandable that some things are going to slip by.  Regardless, I'd still feel a lot better if this thing were nailed down tight but I think we've done an excellent job given the timeframe.</p></p>
