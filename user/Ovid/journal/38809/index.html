<div class="span8">
<p><p>One feature of Moose roles that is if a role provides a method and a class uses that role, if a class defines a method that the role provides, it silently overrides the role's version of said method.  This makes it easy to customize your behavior per class.</p>

<p>However, did you get the "silently overrides" part?  Regardless of this being in the original traits papers, how it's implemented in Perl 6 and how it's implemented in Moose roles, it's a mistake.  I have <em>again</em> lost quite a bit of time debugging this "feature".  I'm really tired of this silent overriding of behavior.  This is what roles are supposed to help with!</p>

<p>The Moose maintainers have not expressed a desire to change this (it's been discussed in this blog) and in fairness to them, Moose is absolutely fantastic in most regards.  However, when working with the larger systems that roles help out with, it's ridiculously frustrating to keep getting bitten by this over and over.  I've discovered that this is a common problem when converting a base class into a role.  You would think that since the child class is overriding the base class, this would be a non-issue, but we often have calls to <tt>$self-&gt;next::method</tt> and everything falls down and goes boom.</p>

<p>It we didn't have a great test suite, this would have hurt our customers badly.</p></p>

<p>Roles are far more than interfaces.  I strongly recommend reading up on them to understand what they do.  The protect (usually) against method collision and they provide a default implementation.  If you want to use one like an interface, it's simple:</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>package MyRole::DoesSomething;<br> <br>use Moose::Role;<br>requires qw(<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; save<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; search<br>);</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>And now your classes (or some other role composed into said classes) must provide <tt>save</tt> and <tt>search</tt> methods.</p><p>However, if you have this:</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>package MyRole::DoesSomething;<br> <br>use Moose::Role;<br>requires qw(<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; save<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; search<br>);<br> <br>sub is_deletable {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my ($self,$id) = "_;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return if $self-&gt;search( children =&gt; $id );<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return 1;<br>}</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>And the class using the role also has an 'is_deletable' method, than this potentially very important behavior is silently discarded.  You need to rewrite it as something like this:</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>package MyRole::DoesSomething;<br> <br>use Moose::Role;<br>requires qw(<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; is_deletable<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; save<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; search<br>);<br> <br>around is_deletable =&gt; sub {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my ($is_deletable,$self,$id) = "_;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return if not $self-&gt;$is_deletable;<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return if $self-&gt;search( children =&gt; $id );<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return 1;<br>};</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>And that solves your problem.  However, silently discarding behavior is not something I expect from roles.  So yes, this is defined as a "feature", but it's one that has repeatedly led to many hours of debugging for me.</p><p>If there was simply a normal "method collision" when the roles are composed, I could easily resolve this in my role composition declarations and maintainers of my code would see it when they edit the file.</p>

<p>So it's indeed also like an Abstract class in Java.

<p>No, it's not like an abstract class.  I can compose several roles into my class in Perl, but I can't multiply inherit from several abstract classes in Java.  Further, if I have two roles which provide the same method name, this fails at composition time but roles (particularly with Moose) offer you a rich variety of ways of resolving conflicts.  You don't get that benefit with abstract classes.</p><p>You also mention the silent overriding and the "clear in your code" and "your IDE will warn you".  Two problems with this.  First, if you add a method to an abstract class and miss one of the classes using it, it's not "clear in your code" because you never saw it.  Plus, what if someone is using a different IDE than you are and the <tt>@Override</tt> annotation doesn't mean anything?  Now you're not just forcing a programming language on me and all the programmers who follow you on the project (which isn't a bad thing), but you're also forcing an IDE on me and all the programmers who follow you on the project (which is a bad thing).  Serious issues like this should be resolved in the language itself, not in a third-party tool.</p>

Still if you redefine a sub in standard procedural code - just as explicitely - you'll get a warning if you have warnings on.

Overriding methods in subclasses is a standard technique - there is no warning, because it is needed and there is no other way.  In the case of roles there is a different way (as the recently anounced solution shows).  So why not have this useful warning?

chromatic,
<p>
FWIW, I agree with you, however a warning cannot hurt and can possibly make it easier to spot problems during heavy role refactoring. And if we find it is more annoying then expected and/or not as helpful as expected, we can remove it as easily as we put it in. The decision made on #moose was that it was a simple enough change and an innocuous enough thing that it was at least worth giving a try. Roles are still a new "thing" and so I still feel like we are exploring some unknown territory here even after using and exploring them for almost 5+ years now (I released Class::Trait 0.01 in 2004).

This particular warning <em>may</em> not hurt (I don't believe that, but I acknowledge the possibility), but warnings can hurt.  I should write a longer post about this.  For now, consider take Vista's UAC for examples of supposedly helpful warnings that do, in fact, hurt.</p>

When I am overriding a role's method but I <em>don't know I'm overriding it</em>, I would like to know that.  Really.  It's important to me.

<p>If Moose developers won't change the default behaviour (I don't know the issues well enough to argue either way) then I'd hope they'd be open to providing a mechanism to let you do it yourself.</p><p>Perhaps you already can by sub-classing Moose::Role.</p>

Sounds like the way to go.</p><p>And at this point, even if they did agree this behavior is wrong (I don't believe they do), this has been part of the interface long enough that I doubt they would change it (kind of like how Perl 5's SUPER:: bug has never been fixed).</p>

Okay, after much discussion on #moose (soon to be summarized on the mailing list) we will be adding a warning so that when a class method silently overrides the role method it will warn you that this is happening. In order to silence the warning you will have to explictly exclude the method from the role (see <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/drolsky/Moose-0.74/lib/Moose/Cookbook/Roles/Recipe2.pod" title="cpan.org">Moose::Cookbook::Roles::Recipe2</a cpan.org> for information on this feature).

For more details, watch for my summary mail on the mailing list.
