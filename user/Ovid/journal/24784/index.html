<div class="span8">
<p><p>Is there anyone here who is very familiar with the "Higher Order Perl" parser and is interested in a side project?  The current work that Richard Freytag has done with Parse::Yapp to implement a new parser for AI::Prolog has been great, but the code runs in reverse.  This breaks a lot of things.  Unfortunately, I can't seem to figure out how to fix this.  The HOP parser has looked promising, but my initial attempt at getting that working has run into a couple of unexpected snags.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested in a complicated side project with a very definite goal, I'd love some help.  Let me know here or shoot me an email.</p></p>

I really ought to take a look at the book, then. I wasn't really planning to, until this came up.

<p>This is one of the finest books on programming I have ever read, bar none.  There's a very short list of books I've read where I immediately take the knowledge I've gained and apply it to my professional life.  The three that come to mind are Mastering Regular Expressions, Damian's OO book and HOP.</p>

The Practice of Programming doesn't qualify?

<p>Well, since "books I've read" was one of my qualifiers, I would say "no"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
