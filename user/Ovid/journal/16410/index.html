<p><p>Like, I suspect, many programmers, I have a ton of things lying around on my hard drive that I've not sent to the CPAN because "it's not ready yet".  At a Portland Perl Mongers meeting the other day, Michael Schwern presented a bunch of modules, some of which were put on the CPAN partially formed in the hopes that they might benefit someone.  As a result, I was inspired to go ahead and put <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/ovid/AI-NeuralNet-Simple-0.01/">AI::NeuralNet::Simple</a> on the CPAN.  It needs word, but my lack of tuits ensured that it would never leave my hard drive unless I just got off my tail and uploaded.</p>

<p>If you're interested, feel free to give me feedback on the code (particularly the C).  The <tt>examples/</tt> directory has a nifty example of a primitive game character AI.</p></p>

Uploading something early could be regarded as a fight for namespace, but looking at the way the community uses the CPAN most of the time, everybody can benefit from an early upload.<br> <br>And the author can benefit from feedback as you mention.<br> <br>In my opinion you did the right thing.<br>

<p>Thanks.  I had some misgivings, but felt it was worth it anyway.  Now maybe it's time for <tt>Bundle::Ovid</tt><nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
