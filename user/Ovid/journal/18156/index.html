<p><p>Given the choice between Notepad and Vi, it should be clear that there is no choice.  Even if you're an Emacs fan, I suspect you'd choose Vi (assuming you knew it).  <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node=Belmonts">I've a friend who's learning Perl</a> and he uses it quite a bit now.  I've also introduced him to Vi and he's gotten quite used to it.</p>

<p>And then there's his job.  He has to write a lot of VBScript and he's discovered that he has a mental block that somehow forces him to use Notepad when using this language.  Somehow, I think there's something deeply symbolic about this :)</p></p>

<h2>As time goes vi...</h2>

first there was notepad. and it was good.<br> <br>then there was vi, and it was better.<br> <br>then there was vim, which seriously pisses in vi's cheerios.<br> <br>I've even brought over a port of vim to my old MacOS 8.6 machine, I like it so much. Even stopped using BBEdit over there.<br> <br>Lately I've tested bluefish and quanta on Fedora Core 1 for web development and continually kept going back to gvim as I was just far more productive in it. EVEN given all these extras that come with those two. (I also tried screem but it's IMHO not ready for prime time yet)<br> <br>So, this client's site, which uses Perl (CGI.pm, DBI, DBD::mysql), PHP, MySQL, Javascript, HTML 4.01, CSS2, all beautifully woven together, was basically done entirely in vim. The syntax highlighting and auto-indenting are superior. macros, multi-windows, multiple clipboards, marks, comment-folding. Life is good.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:o)

First there was ed, and it was THE STANDARD.<br> <br>Then there was vi, but it required grabbing a glass terminal, and who could manage that?<br> <br>Then there was emacs, which thrashed magnificently on underspecced timeshared Vaxen.<br> <br>But emacs grabbed the finger-control neurons, so must now be ported to any new platform before work can be accomplished.<br> <br>I still sometimes use ed for those "change one line" jobs.<br>
