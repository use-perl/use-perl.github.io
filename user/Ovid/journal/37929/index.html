<h1>Test::Most::explain: need steroid advice</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>Summary:  my local version of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Most/">Test::Most</a> can do this (note the variable names!), but I am pondering the interface:</p>

<pre>use Test::Most 'no_plan';

ok 1;
my ( $foo, @bar ) = qw( this is a list );
explain $foo, \@bar;
__END__
# $foo = 'this';
# @bar = (
#          'is',
#          'a',
#          'list'
#        );</pre>

<P>For years, people have struggled with tests with the following:</p>

<pre>diag $foo</pre>

<p>And then they've cursed when they've seen the result:</p>

<pre># HASH(0x80631d0)</pre>

<p>So they remember to call <tt>Data::Dumper</tt> or something similar:</p>

<pre>use Data::Dumper;
diag Dumper($foo);
__END__
$VAR1 = {
          'foo' => 'bar'
        };</pre>

<p>Of course, that's ugly formatting and grunt work that the programmer doesn't want to do.  So I added the <tt>explain()</tt> function to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Most/">Test::Most</a>.  If it sees a reference, it calls Dumper for you:</p>

<pre>use Test::Most 'no_plan';
explain $foo;
__END__
{
    'foo' => 'bar'
};</pre>

<p>We've also done away with that annoying <tt>$VAR1</tt>, but I always thought that was ugly, so I did away with it.  Perhaps I shouldn't, but there you go.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that I tried to add <tt>explain()</tt> to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Simple/">Test::More</a>, but Schwern vetoed the Dumper/diag combination.  It's now the relatively broken:</p>

<pre>diag explain $foo;</pre>

<p>That's why I still support <tt>explain()</tt> in <tt>Test::Most</tt>.  However, this also means that I can have fun with this.  My current idea is to put the <tt>$VAR1</tt> back in there, but with a twist:  if you don't have <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Data-Dumper-Names">Data::Dumper::Names</a>, you see the old <tt>explain()</tt> behavior.  However, if you <em>do</em> have it installed you can see the variable names:</p>

<pre>use Test::Most 'no_plan';

ok 1;
my ( $foo, @bar ) = qw( this is a list );
explain $foo, \@bar;
__END__
# $foo = 'this';
# @bar = (
#          'is',
#          'a',
#          'list'
#        );</pre>

<p>Now that, I think, is major juju coolness.  It also turned out quite handy when I was sprinkling <tt>::explain()</tt> statements in a module, trying to work out what was broken.  The variables had different names, but carried similar values, making it hard to see which was which.  This made it trivial.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this necessitates a couple of changes.  First, <tt>Data::Dumper::Names</tt> needs to be told how far up the call stack to look.  Currently it only looks up one level, the simplistic, but ugly fix is to allow something like this:</p>

<pre>sub explain {
    return unless $ENV{TEST_VERBOSE};
    if ($DATA_DUMPER_NAMES_INSTALLED) {

        # Ugly!
        local $Data::Dumper::Names::UpLevel = 2;
        diag(Data::Dumper::Names::Dumper(@_));
    }
    else {
        # normal behavior
    }
}</pre>

<p>The other issue is the interface to <tt>Test::Most</tt>.  Just how much magic should I pack into one function?  Maybe I should make another function, <tt>show</tt>, which has this behavior?  This is incredibly useful, but I'd like to figure out the best interface here and this could be tricky.</p>

<p>Side note:  this trick wouldn't work easily with <tt>Data::Dumper::Simple</tt> as Simple uses a source filter and I shouldn't be applying that to your code unless you ask. However, <tt>Data::Dumper::Simple</tt> does a couple of tricks that <tt>Data::Dumper::Names</tt> cannot.  First, it doesn't require a backslash in front of arrays and hashes.  Second, it would correctly report the names with this:</p>

<pre>print Dumper($foo[3]);</pre>

<p><tt>Data::Dumper::Names</tt> can't figure out the container for that variable, so it gets reported as <tt>$VAR1</tt>.  If there's a way around that, I'd love to hear it :)</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:  the main problem I'm finding with this approach:</p>

<pre>explain "Check that users can be loaded";
__END__
# $VAR1 = 'Check that users can be loaded';</pre>

<p>That's not what I want and could get tricky.  I think a separate <tt>show()</tt> function would be better after all (though I could get crazy and if the variable is readonly and I can't determine the variable name, I could omit the <tt>$VAR1</tt>.  Madness I tell you.  Madness!)</p></p>

<p>I think Test::Most is now replacing my default use Test::More<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>To be fair, I haven't actually added the default "show variable name" behavior yet.  I've got to get the interface issues nailed down first<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p><p>And why weren't you using it beforehand?  I even bundle <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Exception/" title="cpan.org">one of your modules</a cpan.org> with it!</p>

<h2>Data::Dump</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dingo/">dingo</a> on 2008-11-24T18:57:46</h3>
i prefer to use Data::Dump because it avoids the ugly $VAR1 cruft



<h2>Yes!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jeremiah/">jeremiah</a> on 2008-11-26T10:29:24</h3>
 I like the elegance of show with the source filter.

<p>Surprise!  It's done without a source filter<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  It uses Data::Dumper::Names which, in turn, uses PadWalker to fetch the variable names.  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Most/" title="cpan.org">Test::Most 0.20_01</a cpan.org> has a developer implementation.  Already I have a couple of issues.</p><p>First, since <tt>Data::Dumper::Names 0.03</tt> is only recommended and not required, one test fails sporadically.  My bad<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Also, because this uses PadWalker, this shows us as $VAR1 instead of the variable name:</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>show $@;</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>That's because $@ is not a lexical.  I don't know how to get around that, so I need to document this as a limitation.</p>

<p>I wonder if it&#8217;s possible to find your caller&#8217;s op tree and find your call site in it, then isolate the parameter expression and deparse it&#8230; that would be a rock solid approach.</p><p>But I don&#8217;t know if the Perl introspection stuff is quite up to that level at this point.</p>
