<div class="span8">
<p><p>In a similar vein to <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Ovid/journal/28749">this post</a>, I once again need to see which modules are loaded.  However, even with Sean Burke's excellent <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Versions-Report/">Module::Versions::Report</a>, I can't tell if modules without version numbers are different, so I hacked up my <tt>Loaded.pm</tt> (first link), to generate md5 sums if no version number is present -- very common with in-house code -- but also to let me filter my version lists:</p>

<pre>package Loaded;

use strict;
use warnings;
use Module::Info;
use Digest::MD5 'md5_hex';

##############################################################################

=head1 NAME

Loaded -- identify which modules are loaded

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Test::More 'no_plan';
 use Loaded;
 # all your tests
 END { diag Loaded::versions() }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to dump out a list of loaded module versions at any
point in a program (typically at the end).  This is useful when you debugging
subtle problems.  Dump the version lists from separate installations to a file
and run C<diff> on them.

However, sometimes modules (particularly in-house code) doesn't have version
numbers.  When that happens, we just try to read the code and call
C<Digest::MD5::md5_hex()> on it.

You can pass a string to the import list and only modules whose name matches
that string (as a regex) will be loaded:

 use Loaded '^Template::';   # get versions of all loaded Template:: modules

 END { diag Loaded::versions() }

=cut

my $TARGET;

sub import {
    my $class = shift;
    my ($regex) = @_;
    $TARGET = qr/$regex/ if @_;
}

sub versions {
    my @modules;
    my $max = 0;
    while ( my ( $module, $path ) = each %INC ) {
        $module =~ s/\.pm$//;
        $module =~ s/\//::/g;
        next if $module =~ /^::/;
        next if __PACKAGE__ eq $module;
        next if $TARGET && $module !~ $TARGET;

        if ( length $module > $max ) {
            $max = length $module;
        }
        push @modules => [ $module, get_identifier( $module, $path ) ];
    }
    @modules = sort { $a->[0] cmp $b->[0] } @modules;
    $max += 2;
    no warnings 'uninitialized';
    return join "\n", map { sprintf "%-${max}s %s", @$_ } @modules;
}

sub get_identifier {
    my ( $module, $path ) = @_;

    my $mod = Module::Info->new_from_loaded($module);
    my $version = $mod ? $mod->version : '';
    return $version if $version;

    open my $fh, '<', $path
      or return "Could not determine version";
    my $text = do { local $/; <$fh> };

    # attempt to account for line endings.  May be a stupid idea.
    $text =~ s/[\n\r]//g;
    return md5_hex($text);
}

I'd love to see these features in Module::Version::Report, which is now my problem child<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

<p>Your's?  I see that Ruslan U. Zakirov maintains it and he/she has a bestpractical.com email address.  Is this some strange alias or something?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Ruslan works for me. I _believe_ that both he and I are comaint on PAUSE. But it's in my (BPS's) repo and we do a lot of that 'collective code ownership' thing.

<p>So, next question then.  Why do you walk the symbol table instead of consulting <tt>%INC</tt>? Is this in case someone diddles <tt>%INC</tt>?  That seems a bit strange, so I'm assuming that you've seen something I've missed.</p>

<p>Now I'm really confused.  The snippet you have isn't valid Perl<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:/  What's the DB mean there?  Something related to strange things with the debugger and the DB package?  The rest I understand and think it's a non-issue (if you're manually creating a namespace, then the version check is irrelevant as you'll pick that up in code you already have).</p>

<h2>Re:I'd take a patch</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jesse/">jesse</a> on 2007-07-17T15:40:10</h3>
Sorry. the  bits were me copying and pasting sample code from the debugger.<br><br>It's not _manually_ created code I'm concerned about. It's runtime-generated code. Packages that are automatically instantiated by other code.  M::V::R isn't just "what versions are loaded" but also "what's loaded", which can often be a very useful bit of debugging information itself.



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:I'd take a patch</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2007-07-17T15:51:54</h3>
<p>Reminds me of another debugging tool I've thought about:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>use Package::Recreate 'recreate';<br> <br>print recreate($some_package);</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>That would then walk through the package's symbol table and attempt to create a string that's equivalent to the code of a loaded package.  It would likely be very fragile, though, hence using it as a debugging tool.</p>

That could be interesting as part of a "build a mock package" toolkit.
