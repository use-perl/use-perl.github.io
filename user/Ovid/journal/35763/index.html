<div class="span8">
<p><p>Yesterday's <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Ovid/journal/35751">Find the Bug</a> was pretty straightforward for folks, but I'll lay it out here.  Basically, this causes the problem:</p>

<pre>sub foo {
    while ($_ = @_) {}
}

foreach ('bar') { foo($_) }</pre>

<p>That fails with a "Modification of a read-only value" error.  This is because <tt>foreach</tt> without a declared variable implicitly creates an alias to each element in the list, in this case, a string constant.  As a result, <tt>$_</tt> has a value when <tt>foo()</tt> is called and you find yourself attempting to assign to a constant.</p>

<p>I've been bitten by this before and I know some of you have, so you might be asking yourself an obvious question.  Why did I write "it took me a while to see [the bug]?"</p>

<p>Because the bug was triggered by this:</p>

<pre>use Moose;

extends 'Some::Class';</pre>

<P>And somehow, deep in the bowels of the Moose, it fails to load <tt>Some::Class</tt> because that class needs some other class which requires <tt>Exporter::NoWork</tt> and the string constant <tt>Some::Class</tt> gets set as the value of <tt>$_</tt> and <tt>Exporter::NoWork</tt> has a <tt>while ($_ = shift)</tt> line in it.  The first fix was strange:</p>

<pre>use Moose;

use Some::Class;
extends 'Some::Class';</pre>

<p>The real fix is a patch to <tt>Exporter::NoWork</tt> (though I suspect Moose is being a touch naughty, too), but it turns out that this module only has one test, and it's a load test.  I hate sending patches to modules with no test suite :(</p>

<p>Once again, the moral of today's story:  if you use anything which potentially impacts global state, please try to limit it to your local scope!</p></p>

<p>
Well, Moose is not really doing anything very nasty here, the class loading code is quite sane (we "borrowed" it from Class::Inspector). But we are looping through @_ using $_ when we load those classes, so that is where the issue comes from.
</p>
<p>
I have adjusted all code that comes in contact with the class loader so that none of it uses $_ anymore. This should eliminate the issue you are seeing with the Exporter::NoWork and modules like it. This will be available in the next release of Class::MOP/Moose.

<p>I don't think it's terribly nasty, but the implicit aliasing can cause strange behavior if other modules don't play well with that.  Imagine this:</p><p><blockquote> <div><tt>foreach (@_) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; some_other_function($_);<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; # do something with $_<br>}</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>If <tt>some_other_function</tt> did something silly like <tt>s/(.*)/scalar&nbsp;reverse&nbsp;$1/e</tt>, then the above code would break.  Guarding against side-effects is a good thing.  Of course, since <tt>@_</tt> contains aliases, I suppose that the way to be truly paranoid would be:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>foreach my $var (@_ = @_) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; some_other_function(my $temp = $var);<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; # do something with $var<br>}</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>After a while, too much paranoia on my part would get ridiculous, but I'm now understanding better why Larry Wall rejected my proposal to add an 'is rw' shortcut for sub/method signatures in Perl 6 (right now you have to declare this for every argument and that gets tedious, but it's the right thing to do).</p>

<h2>no test suite</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mauzo/">mauzo</a> on 2008-02-26T20:38:46</h3>
Having just got your bug reports, I'm in the middle of writing a test suite now... I wrote E::NW before I'd really cottoned on to the value of testing, and haven't touched it since. I've already found another latent bug.
<p>Unfortunately, <code>local $_</code> isn't safe either. If <code>$_</code> is aliased to a member of a tied hash or array, it isn't localised properly and the value in the hash is affected as well:</p><p><blockquote> <div><tt>tie my %h, 'Tie::StdHash';<br>$h{a} = 1;<br>for ($h{a}) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; local $_ = 2;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; print $h{a};&nbsp; &nbsp; # 2, but should be 1<br>}<br>print $h{a};&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # back to 1 again</tt></div> </blockquote> If you call external code in the scope of the change (as E::NW does) this could be a problem. The workarounds are either to localise all of <code>*_</code> which, besides being ugly, clobbers <code>@_</code> as well, or to use <code>for</code> instead of assigning to <code>$_</code> at all. <code>for</code> doesn't suffer from this problem, and neither does 5.10's <code>my $_</code>.

<p>Oh, nice catch.  We've got local workarounds in place, but I'm happy to know that you've spotted more than I did<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
