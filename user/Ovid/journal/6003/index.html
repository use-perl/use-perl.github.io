<p><p>It looks like there were a few misunderstandings on some aspects of the project (as is practically guaranteed with the rushed deadline), but hopefully these will be quick fixes.  I'm physically exhausted and look forward to nothing more than going home and sleeping, but I have a lot of housework that needs to get done as I haven't had much time to do it lately.</p>

<p>Tests:  838</p>

<p>Personal note:  last night was pool night.  I went up against a guy name Mike and he was slaughtering me.  He immediately jumped out to a 10 point lead and I was just hanging in there by my fingernails.  I rallied late and started to make some jaw-dropping shots (my jaw dropped, too).  Mike got flustered, started to miss some easy ones, and I pulled out the win.  It's only the second match I've won this season, so I really needed it to build my "pool" morale.</p></p>
