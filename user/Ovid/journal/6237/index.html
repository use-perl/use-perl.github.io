<p><p>Well, after <a href="/user/Ovid/journal/6137">getting sent to collections</a> for a bill that I don't owe, it looks like MSN finally credited my account with Qwest.  So all is good, yes?  No.  MSN overcredited my account by a considerable amount, wiping out not only their bill, but also my phone bill and leaving a credit on my account.  Of course, if I call to tell them, they'll probably reverse it and send me to collections again or something really fun like that.  If I don't tell them, than at some point in the future, they're likely to notice and debit my account by something which might quite possibly be the correct amount.</p>

<p>Can anyone guess that I have very little faith in these guys (and gals)?</p></p>

<p>...preferably in writing, where you can spell everything out and the reader has time to review what you said and make sure s/he understands it before making a knee-jerk reaction.  I'd vote for telling everything now in hopes of forestalling problems later on (and possibly getting it fixed and not having to worry about it for a couple of months).</p>
