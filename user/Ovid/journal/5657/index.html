<p><p>We're still working on the refactoring and have not gotten to adding new functionality yet.  However, our client has just discovered that this will, in fact, cost money :)  (yes, they knew this, they were just surprised at the amount).  We're giving them a great price because we're only charging them for the work that needs to be done for them.  We'll be offering this for other clients -- we were going to anyway -- but we won't be charging them for any work that is not specifically for this client.</p>

<p>We're using chromatic's Test::MockObject for the unit testing.  It's a great module that allows unit tests to isolate the current unit's functionality, but integration testing will likely uncover many more bugs.  Already, we've found some weaknesses in our current approach and are rapidly working to deal with them.</p>

<p>On a personal note, I just picked up a 700 megahertz Pentium III with a 15 gig hard drive and a 17 inch monitor for only $135US.  Now I have my first Linux box at home.  Hooray!</p></p>

<p>Unfortunately, my boss's wife's company is having a "hi there, we failed and are going out of business" sale, so this was a special offer that was first available to friends and family.  As far as I understand, the computers were snapped up pretty quickly.</p>

<p>... as were the 20" monitors for thirty bucks<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... which I didn't know about until too late<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(</p>
