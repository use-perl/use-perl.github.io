<div class="span8">
<p><p>Tomorrow I'll be arriving in Oslo as part of the <a href="http://perl-qa.hexten.net/wiki/index.php/OsloQAWorkshop2008">Oslo QA Hackathon</a>.  I'll be presenting my "Turbo Charged Test Suites" talk and generally looking forward to meeting people heavily involved in Perl QA.  I'm particularly interested in the <tt>Test::Builder</tt> 2.0 discussion and TAP improvements.</p>

<p>I want the new <tt>Test::Builder</tt> because I keep hitting the limitations of the current one.  Its plan handling is awful, it's difficult to alter the output and diagnostics are a mess.  Few people hit these problems, but when they do, they're hard to overcome.</p>

<p>The TAP improvements are possibly more important.  People are <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/cc163595.aspx">constantly talking about how to generate test results as XML</a>.  When I was at a Google Test Automation conference, one topic which came up over and over again is how they needed a common XML test result serialization format.  Somehow, the assumption that it <em>must</em> be XML was made over and over again.  TAP, however, isn't an answer because we simply don't capture the needed information.  It is, however, stable and proven.</p>

<p>If we feel TAP is a good tool for others, we need to make sure that it supports how they do things.  For example, here's a jUnit test:</p>

<pre>public void testEquals() {
    Money m12CHF= new Money(12, "CHF");
    Money m14CHF= new Money(14, "CHF");

    Assert.assertTrue(!m12CHF.equals(null));
    Assert.assertEquals(m12CHF, m12CHF);
    Assert.assertEquals(m12CHF, new Money(12, "CHF")); // (1)
    Assert.assertTrue(!m12CHF.equals(m14CHF));
}</pre>

<p>That's one test, not four.  One suggestion for handling that in TAP:</p>

<pre>ok 1 - testEquals
    ok 1 - True(!m12CHF.equals(null))
    ok 2 - Equals(m12CHF, m12CHF)
    ok 3 - Equals(m12CHF, new Money(12, "CHF"))
    ok 4 - True(!m12CHF.equals(m14CHF)</pre>

<p>With nested TAP, the top level test would fail if any "subtests" fail.  Also, it's completely backwards compatible with current TAP because the regex for a TAP line is basically <tt>/\A(?:not&nbsp;)?ok/</tt>, thus ensuring that indented TAP doesn't get recognized.</p>

<p>Nested TAP has its own problems, but Schwern's been here for a couple of days and we've discussed some of the issues involved.  I really hope we get some serious traction on this.</p></p>

hey, re this -- I don't know if you saw this on Planet Perl, but I recently hacked up a conversion script for the other direction:<br><br><a href="http://jmason.org/software/scripts/tap-to-junit-xml.txt" title="jmason.org">http://jmason.org/software/scripts/tap-to-junit-xml.txt</a jmason.org><br><br>head1 NAME<br><br>tap-to-junit-xml - convert perl-style TAP test output to JUnit-style XML<br><br>=head1 SYNOPSIS<br><br>tap-to-junit-xml "test suite name" [ outputprefix ] ) format, and produce XML output in a similar format to that produced by the  ant task.

<p>
Do you remember any conclusions from that discussion, i.e., whether any XML test result formats were proposed or demonstrated?
