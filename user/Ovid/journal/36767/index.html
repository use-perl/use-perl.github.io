<p><p>jplindstrom asked me if I had run the tests since they were failing.  Of course I ran them!  I had no idea how they were failing now when they passed a few minutes earlier.  However, with lots to do that day, I forgot about it.  Then today it happened again.  There were some tests which failed when run individually, but were passing when run via <tt>Test::Aggregate</tt>.  I was worried that there was a bug in my module, but it turns out to be a real bug which was spotted:</p>

<p>Here was my test case:</p>

<pre>  use PIPTest::Setup;
  eval {
      my $setup  = PIPTest::Setup->new;
      my $schema = $setup->init_db;
      die "ha!";
  };
  print "\$\@ is $@\n";</pre>

<p>That printed "$@ is".  Something about the <tt>&amp;init_db</tt> call was screwing up <tt>$@</tt>.  After a binary search through the code, I got it down to this:</p>

<pre>    my $schema = $self->connect_to_db();

    # die "We see this in $@";
    $self->static_table_count($count);
    die "We don't see this in $@";</pre>

<p>So what was in that mysterious <tt>&amp;static_data_count</tt> method?  It's from <tt>Class::Accessor::Fast</tt>:</p>

<pre>sub static_table_count {
    return $_[0]->{static_table_count} if @_ == 1;
    return $_[0]->{static_table_count} = $_[1] if @_ == 2;
}</pre>

<p>I copied that directly into my code and yup, if that got called, it appeared to break eval somehow.  I was completely stumped.  Three of us wound up pouring over that code until the obvious question was asked:  "do we have a DESTROY method?"</p>

<p>Well, duh.  In the DESTROY, we have dbic code.  Naturally, that uses evals internally and when our code dies, the DESTROY is triggered, wiping out my $@.  Adding <tt>local $@</tt> at the top of the DESTROY fixed that.</p>

<p>So please, please, please:  if you use any of Perl's internal variable, localize it first.
</p>

<p>That's not quite what this is about. The problem is that $@ gets set to undef whenever an eval runs successfully, eradicating the current exception object before it can get handled by reaching the <i>intended</i> eval.</p><p>The critic rule would be to always require</p><p><blockquote> <div><tt>DESTROY {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; local $@;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>}</tt></div> </blockquote> where<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... either contains an eval BLOCK, or a sub call which could potentially involve an eval BLOCK. A bit pedantic perhaps, but probably worth it since the alternative is to <b>risk silencing exceptions</b>!.<p>Of course other global vars could be problematic in the same way, but $@ is in an especially weak position since it's involved in flow control.</p>
