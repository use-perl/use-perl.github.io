<div class="span8">
<p><p>So I'm writing an article about how to use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Class/">Test::Class</a> and hoping it will be accepted.  However, I was receiving a lot of strange, hard-to-find errors like the following:</p>

<pre>Can't call method "isa" without a package or object reference at /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.7/Test/Class.pm line 278.</pre>

<p>That was coming from the <tt>isa</tt> check in this method:</p>

<pre>sub _test_classes {
    my $class = shift;
    grep { $_ && $_->isa( $class ) } Devel::Symdump->rnew->packages;
};</pre>

<p>What?  I clearly have a package or else <tt>Devel::Symdump</tt> wouldn't return it, right?  After a lot of debugging, I discovered that whenever I was creating a class, such as <tt>Person</tt>, I would get <em>two</em> packages created.  One for "Person" and another one for " Person" (note the leading space).  This came about from the following code in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-MethodMaker/lib/Class/MethodMaker/Engine.pm">Class::MethodMaker::Engine</a>:</p>

<pre># Generate a unique stash name for the sub.  Use a preceding space
# to avoid collisions with anything in the Perl space.
Class::MethodMaker::set_sub_name($code, $target, $name, " ${target}::${name}");</pre>

<p>So this is clearly a feature of <tt>Class::MethodMaker</tt> and it's certainly not something which Adrian Howard (the author of <tt>Test::Class</tt>), should have reasonably expected.  So I can create a patch for <tt>Test::Class</tt>, which seems like the only reasonable solution here, but what should invoking a method on this package name with a leading space do?  I think the behavior is correct and that <tt>Class::MethodMaker</tt> should try a different approach, but it's a tough call.</p>

<p>In any event, this means I have to rewrite much of the code for the article.  The reason I used <tt>Class::MethodMaker</tt> in the first place is because I didn't want to clutter the code with a lot of boring stub methods but I also thought it would be cheeky to just use my <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-BuildMethods/">Class::BuildMethods</a> module.</p></p>

<h2>Oddball packages *ought* to be ok</h2>

That's just strange and weird. The only things disallowed in package names are apostrophe, double colon, and null. That shouldn't be an error at all!<br><br>Or rather... it appears that to be that package names may be created any which way but to call a method it has to match the following macro or a more complicated utf8 thing I'm having difficulty following.<br><br>#define isIDFIRST(c) (isALPHA(c) || (c) == '_')<br><br>Bummer! This is an arbitrary irregularity!

Get there in the end.
