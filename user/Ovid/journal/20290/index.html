<p><p>Posted primarily as a google lookup.</p>

<p>Once again I need to brush up on my C.  In order to get <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Ovid/journal/20279">borderless terminals with <tt>aterm</tt> and <tt>fluxbox</tt></a> working, I had to use <tt>bblaunch</tt>.  As it turns out, <a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/b/bblaunch.html">bblaunch</a>, an unmaintained program that both blackbox and fluxbox use, has the following line of code in it:</p>

<pre>sprintf(launchargs.call, "%s", (char *)atoi(argv[0]));</pre>

<p>With <tt>launchargs</tt> being a struct:</p>

<pre>typedef struct LArgs
  { 
    char call[1024];
    char command[1024];
    unsigned long flags, attrib, workspace, stack, decoration;
    unsigned long pause;
    Bool iconic;
  } LArgs;</pre>

<p>While that line works fine in Redhat 8, it segfaults under Fedora Core 2.  As it turns out, <tt>launchargs.call</tt> is not actually used, so I was able to comment out that line in bblaunch and recompile and everything worked fine.  Now I need to dig in to find out the reason for the segfault.  If only I knew C as well as Perl.</p></p>

<p>If you've not got a coredump already from it, I'd suggest running it under gdb and using that to
see where it goes boom. All the code looks legal, and I can't see anything that can actually go wrong. Except that <code>argv[0]</code> might be a null pointer. Which seems unlikely, but is the only possible problem that I can spot.</p>

<p>Unless something weird is going on, <code>argv[0]</code> should be the program name.  So doing an <code>atoi</code> will generally produce nothing useful, unless the program's name is <tt>666</tt> or some such.</p>
<p>That said, it seems a far simpler way to do what the code's doing is to just use sprintf to do the work:</p><blockquote><div> <tt>sprintf(launchargs.call, "%d", argv[0]);</tt> </div></blockquote>Which would do nothing -- including not segfault -- if <code>argv[0]</code> isn't numeric.
<p>Fair warning: it's 4:30 am as I write this, after a bout of insomnia.  Use at your own risk.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>

Worse yet, calling atoi on it will give you back an integer, which is then being cast to a char *, so you're looking in whatever bit of memory the integer value you get refers to and treating it as a character array.  There's nothing good that can come of this, it's quite broken.

<p>Oh yes, crap. I missed that cast.</p>

<p>True. There's insufficient context to see whether anyone modified <code>argv</code> (<code>++argv</code> or somesuch). I'm not sure if I'd count modifying <code>argv</code> as weird though, as I've been known to write code that increments it in a <code>while</code> loop to process all command line arguments.</p>

<p>I meant unless <code>argv</code> isn't even the command line: if it's an array internal to the program or something.  Nothing in C enforces using <code>argc</code> and <code>argv</code> for program arguments; it's just a convention that is all too often broken.</p>
