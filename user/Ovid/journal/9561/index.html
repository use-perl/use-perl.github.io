<p><p>Well, no, I don't have an HTML regex engine, but I needed to do this:</p>

<p><tt>s/$old_html/$new_html/g;</tt></p>

<p>Any programmer who's worked with HTML for more than about three seconds has quickly discovered that this is not a viable option.  Is the HTML well-formed?  Does it have extra whitespace?  Did they quote their attributes properly?  Is the attribute case consistent?  It's a frustration.</p>

<p>Today, after a fair amount of searching and asking questions in the Perlmonks chatterbox, I discovered that I simply couldn't find an adequate tool to do this.  Some of the treebuilder tools looked interesting, but the fine-grained control that I needed wasn't there, so I built such a tool.  It's not done, but so far I can tell it to match a given document structure to another document structure and, if they match, replace the target HTML with the new HTML.  I can ignore attributes, force them to be in the correct order or ignore their order, if I wish.  I'm now going to start working on the text matching portion.  It's been fun.  Perhaps this is a CPAN module in the works?</p>

<p>Of course, if my past experiences with use.perl are any indication, someone's going to say "here's what you were looking for".  I'd welcome that as I'm curious to see how my tool stacks up.</p></p>

Did you try tidy? http://tidy.sourceforge.net/

<p>I didn't see your reply on Perlmonks!  In any event, I'm using <tt>HTML::TokeParser::Simple</tt> to get around the problems with bad HTML and it's worked fine.  My basic method is to parse my sample HTML, create a bunch of tokens that I store in an array.  Then, with the target HTML, I do the same thing and if, at any point, I have a matching token stream, I do the replacement.  So far, it's worked out much better than I thought.</p>
