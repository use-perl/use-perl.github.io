<p><p><a href="http://users.easystreet.com/ovid/downloads/TAPx-Parser-0.10.tar.gz">TAPx::Parser 0.10 is now available for download</a> (deliberately not on the CPAN yet).</p>

<p>Not having a 'net connection in my flat yet meant that I was mostly flying blind and had to try and recall what was said on the list from memory.  As a result, I'm sure that what I've put together doesn't quite match what may be expected.  However, I've gotten enough stuff done that I think this could possibly serve as a preliminary TAP::Harness parser.  Any thoughts on this?</p>

<p>From the change log:</p>

<pre>  0.10    23 July, 2006
        - Oh my Larry, we gots docs!
        - _parse and _tap are now private methods.
        - Stream support has been added.
        - Moved the grammar into its own class.
        - Pulled remaining parser functionality out of lexer.
        - Added type() method to Results().
        - Parse errors no longer croak().  Instead, they are available through
          the parse_errors() method.
        - Added good_plan() method.
        - tests_planned != tests_run is no longer a parse error.
        - Renamed test_count() to tests_run().
        - Renamed num_tests() to tests_planned().</pre>

<p>A stream is merely a coderef which returns "chunks" of TAP.  When it returns undef, the stream is considered finished.  It will be trivial for me to change this, if needed.</p>

<p>Second, "Bail out!" doesn't stop the parser.  A careful reading of the TAP docs made it clear that this the the TAP generator's responsibility, not the parsers.  I can change this behavior, if necessary.</p>

<p>Third, the docs are fairly complete, but not well organized.  Specifically, I need to have token methods moved to the main TAPx::Parser page so folks don't have to jump from POD to POD to understand how to use this thing.</p>

<p>Fourth, the interface has changed:</p>

<pre>    use TAPx::Parser;
       
    my $parser = TAPx::Parser->new( { tap    => $string_o_tap } );
    # or
    my $parser = TAPx::Parser->new( { stream => $stream_o_tap } );
     
    while ( my $result = $parser->results ) {
        print $result->as_string;
    }</pre>

<p>The $result object is the token I spoke of earlier.  Each type (qw<comment plan test bailout unknown>) is documented as an appropriate subclass of TAPx::Parser::Results.</p>

<p>Fifth, I deliberately broke the grammar out into its own class to make it easier, in the future, to load different version grammars.  This exposed a problem which Schwern pointed out at one point:  I pushed too much work into the lexer (Ovid shakes his tiny, tiny fist at Schwern).</p>

<p>This is still alpha, so feedback appreciated.  Also, I'm at about 95% test coverage, but it still astonishes me how much more really needs to be tested.</p></p>
