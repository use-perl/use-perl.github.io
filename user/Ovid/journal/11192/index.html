<p><p>Okay, I suppose that <a href="http://about.nordstrom.com/help/Livehelp/default.asp?origin=help">Nordstrom</a>, being a private company has every right to say who can and cannot be in their store, so I have no right to complain.  However, I was very offended by them last Friday and will not be shopping there again.  I was with two friends and we went there to buy shoes for one of them.  My friend Sean, a disabled Gulf War veteran, has a sign on the back of his coat that reads "Uncle Sam sent me to the Persian Gulf and all I got was this lousy syndrome"</p>

<p>Someone at the door, apparently a Nordstrom employee (though she had no nametag and would not identify herself), refused to let him in.  She stated that no one with a sign was allowed in the store.  This wasn't a sign, though, it was just something on the back of his jacket.  Apparently, Nordstrom has decided decided that they don't want money from people who might offend their customer's delicate sense of propriety.  That's okay, they won't be getting our money any more.</p></p>

<h2>Interesting...</h2>

I was curious about this odd policy. A quick google (nordstrom political portland) suggests that Nordstrom has been enjoying picketers and sabateurs angry with Nordstrom for lobbying Portland City Hall to veto an anti-war resolution (see <a href="http://www.portlandmercury.com/2003-03-20/city.html" title="portlandmercury.com">the portland mercury, last thurs.</a portlandmercury.com>).  <em>"Organizers of Saturday's "shop-in" instructed participants to place anti-war leaflets in clothes, and to waste employees' time by purchasing and immediately returning items."</em> The store apparently had 20 extra security people on Saturday.
<p>
So if you didn't know about that, you might be happier that they didn't get your money.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
