<div class="span8">
<p><p>Every week, <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/home.ns>New Scientist</a> has an "Enigma" puzzle.  I've always thought they should be easy to solve with programming, so this week I decided to try it.  Here's this week's puzzle:</p>

<blockquote>Using each of the digits 1 to 9, find a 3-digit positive integer divisible by 7 whose reverse is an integer also divisible by 7, a 3-digit positive integer divisible by 9 whose reverse is an integer also divisible by 9, and a 3-digit positive integer divisible by 11 whose reverse is an integer also divisible by 11.
<br>
<br>
What are the smallest and largest of your six integers?</blockquote>

<p>So basically you want all three digit numbers <em>not</em> containing zero.  When you are examining candidates, the numbers should use "each" of the digits, not just "any".  My program is still getting too many results.  Either I'm missing something fundamental or their is an ambiguity in the spec.</p></p>

You get one pair each for 7 and 11, but two pairs for 9, right? Same here.

Ok, the ambiguity is in the part of the solution they don't ask for. So their actual question has a unique answer.

Is that what you get?

<p>Nope, not even close<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) That tiny spec bears close rereading.  For example, "using each of the digits 1 to 9" for 3-digit numbers means your first grep is off.</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>my @candidates = grep { !/0/ } 111<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... 999;</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>I also used <tt>&amp;List::MoreUtils::uniq</tt> to pre-trim that list (since duplicate numbers are not allowed).</p>

<p>Basically, you'll need a three stage process (I think).  First, generate your candidate list.  Second, find all three digit numbers which satisfy the reverse divisor requirement.  Then construct your final list of three triples.</p>

<p>And though I <em>thought</em> I had matched dakkar's results above, I actually have three numbers for 9<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(</p>

First, you need a "grep { $_ !~<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/0/ }" in there.  Second, I think that your three numbers, concatenated, must use each of the digits only once all together.  That is, a valid answer would be qw(123 456 789) if only those numbers divided properly.  qw(123 331 882) is no good.

<p>That appears to be correct.  You have to read the spec <em>carefully</em>.  They ask you to use <em>each</em> of those numbers, not <em>any</em>.  I got that wrong the first time.</p>

There are a total of 24 solutions to the puzzle.<br/><br/>These 24 solutions are comprised of 10 unique integers.  If you do not consider the reverse of an integer unique, there are 5 unique integers.<br/><br/>No matter which way you slice this - there is no way to get to "six integers" unless the spec is incomplete.

<p>I'm sure they <em>won't</em> publish a correction.</p>

<p>Note that the spec says to find <em>a</em> 3-digit number which satisfies the criteria, not <em>the</em> 3-digit number.  That there are multiple such numbers, and you could've found a different one, doesn't violate the spec.</p>

<p>Once you've done what it says, you will have 3 3-digit numbers, plus their reverses.  That's 6 integers.</p>

<p>Yes, other people could validly come up with a different set of 6 integers.  So what?  There's nothing in the spec prohibiting that!  As others have noted, all that matters is the smallest and largest integers in that set &mdash; and all the possible sets of valid 6 integers have the same smallest and largest.</p>

<p>So, following their instructions does yield 6 integers.  And the answer to the question they asked <em>is</em> unique.</p>

Cool! It's nice to compare strengths/weaknesses/(or just plain differences) of both languages. This syntax is terse and if it were perl (and the function were not clearly named), people would probably complain that it's confusing and unreadable:<p><blockquote> <div><tt>reverse_num = lambda n: int(str(n)[::-1])</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>It's nice that you can slice a string (like substr() on steroids()), though not so nice that you have to cast the number as a string before you reverse it.</p>
<p>It's also nice that sets are built into the language, and "+" seems to "add" sets together. But for large sets, I wonder how efficient code like <code>set1 + set2 + set3 == big_set</code> is (though it probably doesn't matter much for the nine digits we are dealing with here, and I think the smartmatch operator in perl 5.10 would at least accomplish the "==" part). In perl, we would probably use hashes, but I don't think there is a simple/elegant way to do the adding and difference of the sets like you have in your code.</p>
<p>There is also no "yield" statement in perl, but we do have anonymous functions and closures, which could accomplish pretty much the same thing (and more).</p>
<p>No one else seems to be posting solutions yet, so I'll hold off for now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<h2>Re:My solution</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lost-theory/">lost-theory</a> on 2008-06-11T18:18:59</h3>
<p>I probably wrote some things more tersely than other Python programmers would (e.g. the extended slice syntax <tt>[::-1]</tt> for reversing, which not many people use); if it were 'real' code I'd probably clean it up a bit.  The <tt>lambda</tt>'s are another thing I like using in my own code, but are not widely used in practice.  I code in the same style when I'm working on <a href="http://projecteuler.net/" title="projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a projecteuler.net> problems (get something that works first, then worry about 'ugly' hacks).
</p> <p>
I don't mind casting the integer as a string before reversing... it's not a very common operation, and numbers and strings have different operations which apply to them (strings/iterables have <tt>len</tt>, <tt>sort</tt>, <tt>reverse</tt>,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...; ints/numbers have <tt>abs</tt>, <tt>pow</tt>, <tt>hex</tt>,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...), so the behavior seems pretty consistent (IMO).
</p> <p>
Sets might not be the most efficient thing to use, but now that they're built-in in Python they are super handy for easily solving many common list-related tasks (removing duplicates, <tt>diff</tt>ing two lists, etc.).
</p> <p>
depesz's code was quite interesting, if any other solutions (Perl or otherwise) exist I'd be happy to see them<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:)</tt> </p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, we used a lot of the same elements, including<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>/(.).?\1/</tt>.  I decided to recurse.  Since these are all three-digit numbers, a simple <tt>(sort @nums)[0,-1]</tt> gives min and max, so as soon as we get a hit in 11 we have all the info we need.  So yours could be shortened quite a bit further:</p><p><blockquote> <div><tt>for my $d_7 ( $f{7}-&gt;() ) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; for my $d_9 ( $f{9}-&gt;($d_7) ) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for my $d_11 ( $f{11}-&gt;($d_7, $d_9) ) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; printf "min: %d, max: %d\n",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (sort(map { reverse($_)+0, $_ } $d_7, $d_9, $d_11))[0,-1];<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exit;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>}</tt></div> </blockquote> Mine is here.<p><blockquote> <div><tt>#!/usr/bin/perl<br>use warnings;<br>use strict;<br>
&nbsp; <br>my @six = map { $_, reverse($_)+0 } foo([grep { !/0/ &amp;&amp; !/(.).?\1/ } 123..987], [7, 9, 11]);<br>printf "7: %d/%d, 9: %d/%d, 11:%d/%d\nAnswer: %d : %d\n", @six, (sort @six)[0, -1];<br>
&nbsp; <br>sub foo {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my($d, $n) = @_;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $x = shift @$n;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; for my $i (@$d) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (!($i % $x) &amp;&amp; !(reverse($i) % $x)) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (@$n) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my @t = foo([grep !/[$i]/, @$d], [@$n]);<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return($i, @t) if @t;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } else {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return $i;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return;<br>}</tt></div> </blockquote>

My unique answer is (168,861), which are both divisible by seven, (234,432), which are both
divisible by nine, and (759,957), which are both divisible by eleven.<br/><br/>The key is to understand that the authors intend that each of the digits 1-9 is to appears in one, and only one, of the three pairs.<br/><br/>The original post claimed that from 100-999, only numbers with a zero were unworthy of inspection.  In fact, the lowest number worthy of testing with a division is 123, since all numbers less than 123 use either a 0, or use two 1's or two 2's.  With a requirement to use all nine digits, and only able to use three in each pair, we better not have any repeats!
