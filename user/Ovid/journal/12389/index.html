<p>I idly wonder if it's illegal to misprepresent an email as being from a law enforcement agency, but aside from that, I can't help but wonder whether or not some poor fool out there was stupid enough to be frightened.</p></p>

<p>I don't <i>think</i> they actually explicitly claim to be <i>the</i> FBI we all think of. Semantics, of course, but semantics are often the deciding factor.</p>
<p>As to the stupidity part, odds are there are at least a few. I do hope to have the time later tonight to do some screen-scraping of their basic URL with LWP. But I don't want to do it from work, for obvious reasons.</p>

Yep.  There are parts of the world where "FBI" meant <i> <a href="http://www.citypaper.net/articles/022400/eat.bagel.shtml" title="citypaper.net">Fairmount Bagel Institute</a citypaper.net> </i>.  (RIP)

I just got this one for the first time today, and though it was amusing.  They must have harvested some Perl page recently.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/s

*sigh* I guess it was clever, I did show it to somebody when it arrived yesterday, and <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pemungkah/journal/12407" title="perl.org">pemungkah</a perl.org> wrote a journal about it as well.

I suspected the link was a potentially malicious site, so I brought it up in with lynx being extra paranoid.<br> <p>The link is funny.  It brings up a page that says:<br> </p><blockquote><div> <br>SPAM Violation!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This site has been banned for SPAM violations. We apologize for the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; idiot webmaster who could not control him/her self.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you would like your own 100 MB FREE WEB SITE with a long list of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; features simply sign up at 0catch.com.<br> </div></blockquote> <br> <p>It sounds like it's a too elaborate scheme to sell hosting services.  It's hard to believe that this kind of thing is profitable.</p>

I realized that when I said:<br> <p><blockquote><div>It sounds like it's a too elaborate scheme to sell hosting services. It's hard to believe that this kind of thing is profitable.<br> </div></blockquote> <br> <p>I meant the whole thing, the Spam, the site message everything is part of this elaborate scheme.</p>
