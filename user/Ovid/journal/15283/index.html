<p><p>I've heard that Friendster might start charging for their service.  While this isn't terribly surprising, I would think they would try to work the kinks out of their system first.  Last night, I received an email with the subject line " New Friendster message from **** - 10/18/03 10:33 PM".  I went to check my account and there was no message.  Of course, I check this morning and the message <em>is</em> there.</p>

<p>I tried to send a long response, but apparently Friendster thought I was typing too long and logged me out and threw away my response.  After 15 minutes of aggravated retyping (into vim and cutting and pasting), I sent the message, verified that it was sent and forgot about it.  A couple of hours later, I'm back online and check my messages.  Not only does my reply not show up, neither does the original message!  I suspect that when I connect they send me to a different server but they have poor data replication.</p>

<p>They want to <em>charge</em> for this service?  <a href="/user/Ovid/journal/13542">This isn't the first time I've had issues with them</a>.</p></p>

I mean seriously, how hard would it be to write that app?
