<h1>How not to count the elements in an array</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>Due to a question asked at work, I remembered that I see a lot of Perl books (PERL books, actually), recommend the following as a way of counting the elements in an array:</p>

<pre>my $count = $#array + 1;</pre>

<p>On the off chance you do this, it's wrong.  <tt>$count</tt> is now assigned a value one greater than the last index value, not the number of elements in the array.  Almost every single time you do this, you're probably going to get the answer you expect, but because you're using something for a purpose other than what it was intended for, you should not be surprised when it doesn't always do what you want.</p>

<pre>$ perl -le '$[ = 4; my @a = qw<foo bar baz>; print $#a + 1'</pre>

<p>Sure, you could argue that you will never alter the contents of <tt>$[</tt>, so you're therefore safe.  The problem is, you know that sometimes that can give the wrong answer.  Why use something you <em>know</em> won't always work?  I don't get it.  Just use context.  It's both correct and easier to read.</p>

<pre>my $count = @array;
# or, if you must be explict:
print "We have ", scalar @orders, " order(s)";</pre></p>

This one (mis-)feature of Perl is one of my least favorite.<br><br>The problem is that <code>$[</code> was added for <i>one</i> specific purpose: to vary the base index between 0 and 1 as an aid to Fortran programmers who had trouble adjusting to the world of zero based indexing.  Most people don't realize that <code>$[</code> exists, or why it exists, sadly.<br><br>The issue here is that <b>the</b> idiom for counting elements in an array <b>should</b> be <code>$count = @array</code>.  However, the <code>$count = $#array + 1</code> idiom (mostly) works, and meets another criteria Perl aims to fufill: it should be comfortable to use regardless of your background.  If you're a dyed in the wool C programmer, you should feel free to use a C-like pidgin of Perl and C (including <code>$c = $#a + 1</code>).  However, you should be <i>encouraged</i>, but not <i>required</i> to adopt Perlish idioms at your own pace (including <code>$c = @a</code>).<br><br>But because <code>$[</code> exists, it <i>could</i> be set to some nonsensical value like <code>3</code> or <code>-4</code>.  That's possible, but quite improbable.  Using an argument about something improbable to convince someone to stop using a C-like idiom and start using a native Perl idiom is, well, unconvincing.<br><br>For comparison, consider the task of building a soundproof room.  You could take into account all of the ambient noise, all of the vibration from the surroundings, and so forth to make a room mostly soundproof.  However, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/quirks/media/2005-2006/mp3/qq-2006-05-06f.mp3" title="www.cbc.ca">if the sun were to go supernova, the pressure wave would hit the earth at 300db</a www.cbc.ca>.  But do you really need to isolate your soundproof room from this?  Not really.  First of all, if a 300db soundwave went past your soundproof room, you wouldn't hear it, because the bones in your ear start to break down at 160db.  Second, the probably won't go supernova, and any kind of explosion would be billions of years in the future (i.e., not in your lifetime).  Third, even if the sun <i>did</i> go supernova, dealing with busted ears is going to be the least of your problems.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>If you want to convince people from using <code>$c = $#a + 1</code>, please find a better, less improbable argument, or just accept that it exists for a reason (albeit a dubious one).

<p>If it (mostly) works then you should tell them how it always works. No?</p>

... looping through the index for all elements in an array using<blockquote> <div><tt>for my $i (0<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.. $#array) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>}</tt></div> </blockquote>Again, the code is written under the assumption that the first array element has index 0.

Eeek, so our loops that require indexes should look like this?<br/><br/>  for my $i ($[<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.. $#array) {<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
  }<br/><br/>Wow, I have a lot of almost working code<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>Worse yet, you should almost never use that index.  Try to do </p><blockquote> <div><tt>foreach my $elem (@array)</tt></div> </blockquote> if at all possible.  The only time I use an index is when I have two parallel arrays.  Using this other idiom completely eliminates the index: you just access the things you want to get to directly.

<blockquote> <div><em>Why use something you know won't always work?</em></div> </blockquote>

<p>Good luck with <em>that</em> argument.  Meanwhile, my campaign to get people to call methods as methods, not functions, has stalled.</p>



<h2>OTOH...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Abigail/">Abigail</a> on 2006-07-16T00:47:29</h3>
<p>There is a small advantage of using <tt>$#array + 1</tt> over <tt>@array</tt>: the former will give you the number of elements regardless of its context (assuming $[ isn't set). <tt>@array</tt> won't give you the number of elements when used in list context.
</p><p>
And I bet more people get bitten by an unexpected context, then by <tt>$[</tt> being set to a non-zero value.</p>



<h2>Nooo! Don't tell people to fix this!</h2>
