<p><p>I've been to three OSCON's, one YAPC::EU, but this is my first workshop and so far I'm having a blast.  It's short enough that burnout doesn't seem to be the same factor as one has with OSCON, but it's packed chock full of information.  So far, the talks have been good, as have the speakers, and they provided the <em>best</em> lunch I've ever had at a Perl event.</p>

<p>My two favorite talks were probably SÃÂ©bastien Aperghis-Tramoni's <a href="http://maddingue.free.fr/conferences/npw-2007/old-perls/">Old Perls and new code</a> and Jonathan Worthington's <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/npw2007/talk/539">Classes, Roles, and Constraints in Perl 6</a>.</p>

<p>The one thing I'm wondering about now, for Perl 6, is how <tt>$object.can($method)</tt> is implemented.  If an object can do a a particular method name, it does guarantee that it has the same signature.  I can grab a method object and introspect it, but that's harsh.  Time to hit the mailing lists.</p>

<p>My own talk, by the way, seriously needs updating.  At the time I pitched it, there were several ways to run test suites written in multiple languages.  I could have spent a lot of time covering the various strategies, including the <tt>--execrc</tt> switch, which was effectively me using YAML as a domain-specific language for running tests.  That seemed awful to me, and it was complicated, so I killed all of the other ways except for the <tt>--exec</tt> switch.  Now I can explain how to run multi-language test suites in a lightning talk instead of a full presentation, so I digressed a bit into the history of TAP and how it compares to XML for suitability for it's task.  I need to repitch my talk for Vienna now.</p></p>

Hey Ovid!<br/><br/>I agree, it was an excellent conference. I am sorry I missed your talk, I too had the b.d. foy / Ovid choice to make, maybe you will be in Austria?

<p>Jeremiah, no worries.  I wanted to be in his talk, too<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  My worry about Austria is that this will happen again and I'll be presenting while Audrey is talking and I really want to see her talks on Jifty.</p>

Yeah, I want to see that Jifty thingy too. I have been looking at it, as well as Catalyst and the PerlJax module (or whatever it is called). I am unsure if using a framework is worth it, I mean I can just hook in JavaScript externally via CGI.pm and I already have DBI.pm and Template so templating and database are taken care of. Still, it would be interesting to see where these frameworks go, Rails has certainly caught on.
