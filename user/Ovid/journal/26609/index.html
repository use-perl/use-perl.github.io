<p><p>Some of you may recall <a href="http://sunsite.univie.ac.at/textbooks/mysql/manual.html#Broken_Foreign_KEY">how the MySQL docs used to argue that foreign key constraints were a bad idea</a> and did not belong in the database.  They no longer include this embarrassing discussion in their docs ("hey, I got rid of 'strict' and my program worked!") but many of their users still don't get it.</p>

<p>Witness <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=99/08/10/0416205&tid=124">a recent /. discussion</a> and a reply where the poster writes "<a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=836&cid=1755591">I've never missed transactions. The one time they would have been nice I was able to catch the exception and delete the incomplete information.</a>"</p>

All this stuff about MySQL, and yet I seem to be the only person that gets pissed off about auto_increment and needs proper sequence support.<br><br>The day that MySQL gets sequences, I'll stop calling it a piece of useless low-end shit. I promise.

<p>Heh, I remember a time when SQL Server (yes, the Microsoftian version) didn't have sequences. I was doing a porting project from Oracle and they actually ended up implementing sequences as a server side procedure. It was ghastly.</p>

does MSSQL (or Sybase for that matter) have sequences now? I thought you accomplished this action only through IDENTITY fields...

I haven't had reason to work with MS-SQL since so I am not sure. A bit of Googling reveals that they don't. To be fair, this was more of being used to the control and convenience of Oracle sequences than anything else.

<p>*sigh* project ended somewhere in 2002. Looking at the date submitted, it seems that I may have just missed its' arrival on CPAN.</p>

<p>At least I'll be better informed in the future; thanks.</p>

<h2>Recent?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/kelan/">kelan</a> on 2005-09-06T16:05:32</h3>
I agree with you, except about the discussion being recent. That topic and comment were posted to Slashdot in 1999.<br><br>Incidentally, the Slashcode engine does allow you to see the year of a post, it's just not set to by default. When I found out, I was quite pleased, because it can be very confusing not knowing the year of a comment. To do so, look under your Preferences, in the Homepage section. The Date/Time Format setting is near the top.

<p>Wow.  Five years ago.  How the hell did I miss that?  Bizarre.</p>
