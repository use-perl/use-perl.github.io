<p><p>My coauthor recently sent an email to me and our agent letting us know that he was backing out of the book proposal.  He cited a lack of time and I completely understand his reasons, but it does mean that I need to rethink things.  To be quite blunt, I don't have the breadth of knowledge to write what we were pitching, so I had to blunt about that.  Instead, I started working on a proposal that better reflects my skill set and still would be of benefit to the community.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, it appears that publishers seem to be hungry for books right now.  Through my agent, I was approached about two different deals.  One is for a Perl book that, for various reasons, can't quite fit what the publisher is looking for.  I asked for clarification on some of their points, but haven't heard back.</p>

<p>The other Perl book was for something that I know <em>nothing</em> about.  I was sorely tempted, but I think it wouldn't be fair to the Perl community for me to follow the Make Sh*t Up route.  So I hit that editor with a counter-proposal and she actually liked it!  Now, I just need to finish it and add some tweaks to fit their needs.  Unfortunately, at over 500 lines of POD, I had to stop and rethink the structure.  It's a pretty ambitious proposal and has soooo many ways to go wrong.</p></p>
