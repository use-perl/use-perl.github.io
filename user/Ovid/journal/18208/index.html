<p><p>Somehow, my notions of relaxing on the weekend are a bit odd (though not for geeks).  On Friday, I made it to Flux, a local Goth/Industrial dance night.  Their new location has leather couches, a leopard-print rug and white fur covered columns.  Needless to say, people were a bit surprised.</p>

<p>I also finished and submitted the patch for the <tt>ref ($proto) || $proto</tt> documentation issue and am pleasantly surprised to note that it was accepted and applied to bleedperl.  I now have three patches in Perl.  Yay me :)</p>

<p>I'm also about a third of the way through converting a C program to Perl.  When it's done, I will have an artificial life simulator that allows a programmer to create a synthetic ecosystem using Lamarckian evolution and simple neural networks to view the interactions of "tiger", "cow", and "plant" agents in a small toroidal world.  This is teaching me quite a bit about different coding styles and I've discovered that <tt>Class::Struct</tt> is <em>very</em> handy with such a conversion.  The one thing that I would really like to change about <tt>Class::Struct</tt> (and subclassing is explicitly forbidden) is to make the methods lvalues.  It would make conversion much simpler if I could do this:</p>

<pre>$agent->location->y = 13;</pre>

<p>And then I went hot tubbing.</p></p>

<h2>lvalue methods</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vsergu/">vsergu</a> on 2004-04-05T21:06:54</h3>
<p>Have you read the bit in perlsub that suggests lvalue methods like that are a bad idea?</p>

<blockquote><div>
<p>A normal mutator can check the supplied argument before setting the attribute it is protecting, an lvalue subroutine never gets that chance.</p>
</div></blockquote>

<p>Okay, it's a run-on sentence, but it seems reasonable to me, and it then gives an example. Do you disagree? I haven't done much with lvalue subroutines, so maybe there's a way around the problem.</p>

<p>Wow.  That perldoc sentence is as bad as some of the sentences I've been known to spit out:  <tt>s/,/;/;</tt>.</p>

<p>I think you're right.  A nice idea foiled by a poor implementation<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(</p>
