<div class="span8">
<p><p>I'm writing a new article and am going to figure out where to submit it.  This one is about lexing without parsing (well, lexing without a grammar, to be accurate).  Perl is great at munging text, but sometimes we have complicated text that we need to analyze, but we have no proper grammar for it.  If the data is a line oriented logfile with a very predictable format, no big deal.  However, if it's rather irregular and the regular expressions are getting too complicated, lexing the data into predictable tokens can make a hard problem very easy to manage.</p>

<p>A good example of this is <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=472701">parsing SQL</a>.  There's no complete SQL grammar written in Perl and the snippet I posted showed how to extract column aliases (SQL::Statement uses SQL::Parser and doesn't handle CASE statements, so it's not a solution.  Jeff Zucker welcomes patches, though :)</p>

<p>Disclaimer:  I'm not claiming that this technique (which I learned from HOP, I might add) is the best way of solving the "parsing SQL" problem.  It's merely an illustration of the technique involved.  A more complicated example involves transforming math expressions.</p>

<pre>X \= 9 / (3 + (4+7) % ModValue) + 2 / (3+7).</pre>

<p>I found myself needing to transform expressions like that into Prolog, respect precedence and allow parentheses to override precedence to become this:</p>

<pre>ne(X, plus(div(9, mod(plus(3, plus(4, 7)), ModValue)), div(2, plus(3, 7)))).</pre>

<p>Writing a simple lexer made it very easy to do, though I'll probably beef it up to allow constant folding.</p>

<pre>ne(X, plus(div(9, mod(14, ModValue)), .2)).</pre></p>

<h2>Parsing SQL</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2005-08-30T01:18:43</h3>
Creating a grammar for ANSI SQL is possible I suppose, but vendor nuances would make it difficult to come up with an all encompassing solution.
<p>
I wonder if the major DB vendors have their respective grammars hidden in a vault somewhere, taunting us.</p>

In Oracle's case, they absolutely do.<br><br>I used to use the online docs with the "rail road" graphics in them (which are derived from the BNF) all the time.

<p>That's why <tt>SQL::Parser</tt> allows you to name the SQL dialect you're working with.</p>

<p>As a general purpose solution, though, I've thought it would be nice to use the parser from SQLite.  A tempting thought, but my C is probably not up to snuff.</p>

Is there an Oracle dialect available somewhere for SQL::Parser?<br/><br/>I have a little "project" to see which Oracle columns and tables are being used in an internally developed report generator.

<p>I'm not an expert with <tt>SQL::Parser</tt>.  You'll have to ask jzed, the author.  His contact info is in the docs.  He's quite helpful.</p>
