<p><p>I was about halfway through the latest Neal Stephenson novel when I inexplicably found myself reading some Neil Gaiman.  And Terry Pratchett.  And Al Franken.  I thought I was enjoying Quicksilver, despite it's relatively slow pace, but I've yet to finish it, despite having proudly acquired a signed first edition.</p>

<p>Curiously, no one that I've spoken to who has the book has finished reading it, either.  Have you?</p></p>

<h2>Signed first edition!!!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/CromeDome/">CromeDome</a> on 2003-12-02T01:50:05</h3>
Damn, I'm jealous.<br> <br>Anxiously awaiting a copy for (hopefully) either Christmas or my birthday.  If you finish it, let me know what you think of it.<br>



<h2>Oh yeah</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gnat/">gnat</a> on 2003-12-02T03:42:42</h3>
I finished it.  It's no mean feat.  He leaves moments of brilliance in a slow-moving story to keep you reading.   I didn't hate the book, but I'm not awaiting the second as eagerly as I was awaiting the first<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<p>

I'm now close to finishing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0374208824" title="amazon.com">Not Much Just Chillin</a amazon.com> which is a much more interesting (and at times scary) story.</p><p>

<h2>...sounds familiar ...</h2>

I had trouble finishing other Stephenson's books. I just don't get him<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>Waiting for the softcover</h2>

It's not like my "to read" pile isn't dangerously high already.

Don't I know it.  I have a stack of about eight books on my nightstand.  The ones at the bottom haven't been touched in months as I keep finding new books to read.

My productivity is falling down since I <a href="http://jesuitninja.org/blog/en/books/quicksilver" title="jesuitninja.org">began to read it</a jesuitninja.org> one week ago. That said, I'm known to have an irrational attraction for large books.

My copy is sitting on my desk unopened.  I keep choosing lighter books.  I don't want to lug the giant tome on the bus or on the plane.  I even reread Snow Crash over the holidays.
