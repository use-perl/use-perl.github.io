<p><p>No, the two topics in the subject aren't related.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=186362">adrianh</a> just let me know about <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/LPALMER/Math-Logic-Predicate-0.03/">Math::Logic::Predicate</a>, which appears to do everything that <tt>AI::Perlog</tt> does, but it approaches it from a different angle, both programatically and stylistically.</p>

<p>I'm considering returning to college to finish my Bachelor's.  Since I work full-time and I don't intend to quit, I've been looking at online schools such as the <a href="http://www.uoponline.com/default.asp">University of Phoenix</a> and the <a href="http://www.aiuonline.edu/">American Intercontinental University</a>.  Neither of them excites me much, but it would be much easier to fit into my schedule.  I have to admit that I'm curious as to why their fees are as high as many "normal" aniversities as they don't have to pay rent on class space for the likes of me.  I also worry about what a potential employer might think, but I have enough work experience that it doesn't concern me <em>too</em> much.  Still, I've never taken the thought of an online education seriously, so I assume that others feel the same way.  Yuck.</p></p>

<h2>How about a Ph.D?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/VSarkiss/">VSarkiss</a> on 2002-08-30T20:31:21</h3>
<p>Why aim low with a B.S.?  My inbox is overflowing with offers of Ph.D.'s for next to nuthin'.  I'll forward you all of them!</p>
<p>Silliness aside, I've always wondered how online university degrees appear to others.  I wasn't quite sure what to make it of it when I saw them on candidate resumes.  On the one hand, it shows initiative, but on the other, it seems like such a weak choice.</p>
