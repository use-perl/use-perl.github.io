<p><p>One of the joys of working for a small company is that you can get to know your coworkers very well and have conversations that would get you fired in a larger company.  I never would have dared to say the following in a large shop.</p>

<p>One of our applications has status bars to show how much longer it will take to load some data.  For some reason, my boss was asking why my app didn't have idiot lights.  We looked at someone else's version of the app and the status bars popped up to show the loading time and my boss pointed at them and said "see, he has idiot lights".</p>

<p>I asked if anyone else had heard the term idiot lights applied to status bars prior to about 15 seconds ago.  My boss looked at me and said "you mean you don't know what idiot lights are?"</p>

<p>"Other than the gleam in your eye, no."</p>

<p>Thank god I have an <em>excellent</em> working relationship with him :)</p>

<p>In other news, I am still having problems with Qwest.  I just received a bill from them for close to $150.00.  I have no problem with that as I have, in fact, owed that money.  However, I already paid it.</p></p>

I've always heard "idiot light" in the context of the oil light on the car, vs. an oil pressure gauge.  You don't want to keep track of the pressure on the car, but you know if the red "OIL" idiot light comes on, you better stop.

No, that just means your bit of black tape covering the idiot lights fell off.<br> <br>Homer.

I sent this link to my boss, and he said "You would have no qualms about saying this to me."<br> <br>He'd also have no qualms about saying this to me.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
