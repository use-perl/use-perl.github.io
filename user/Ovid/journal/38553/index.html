<h1>Why Visualization Rocks</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>You've probably read about <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-Sniff/">Class::Sniff</a>, software I've "written in anger" to deal with some terribly class composition issues.  Because I already had a graph available, I decided to use it for visualization of class hierarchies.  I know some people sneer at visualization ("hey, just let me read the code!"), but really, they're wrong.  Reading code gives you fine-grained knowledge that a diagram cannot.  Seeing the diagram <em>instantly</em> gives you knowledge about the code which it could ages slogging through the code to acquire.</p>

<p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jplindstrom/journal/">jplindstrom</a> started using <tt>Class::Sniff</tt> to refactor our code base.  Here's a small part of it <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/publius_ovidius/pic/000165hc/g11">before using Class::Sniff</a>.  Here's the same bit <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/publius_ovidius/pic/00017qxy/g11">after using Class::Sniff</a>.  It still has issues, but it is far, far better than it was.  Heck, which would you want to work on?</p>

<p>Our test suite reveals that this refactoring has introduced one bug -- amusingly in the code with the tiny amount of multiple inheritance left.  Seems we have an exception being thrown twice, but we're having trouble tracking it down.</p></p>

<p>This had nothing to do with multiple inheritance. At all.</p><p>The problem was it wasn't a pure refactoring. It added functionality to a class (which was appropriate), and the setup code for the failing test wasn't amended to reflect this.</p>

<p>Are you saying that you don't have a problem with multiple inheritance, or that you're just not worried about it and eliminating it was just a side-effect of something else you were trying to do?</p>

<p>I'm saying the bug had nothing to do with MI.</p><p>My reply was referring to the last paragraph about the bug, not the whole post. Reading the reply again, I can see that wasn't clear.</p>
