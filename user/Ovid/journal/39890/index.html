<p><p><a href="http://www.perl.org/">perl.org</a> actually looks modern now!  This has been in the works for a while now and, as far as I know, Leo Lapworth was the principle designer.  And no, this was not a result of the marketing committee.  Just another great volunteer who wanted to make Perl not look dead :)</p>

<p>There are other nice things to come, too.  I'm really looking forward to some of the changes which are occurring in the Perl community.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:  Apparently, <a href="http://www.foxtons.co.uk/">Foxtons</a> is responsible for sponsoring this work.  For those outside the UK: Foxtons, from what I understand, is one of the largest estate agents in the UK.  Apparently, they got there by being very innovative and investing in a top-notch IT department.  An IT department which, not surprisingly, uses a lot of Perl :)</p></p>

Looks Great!  Now if we can just do something about perl.com, which appears to be mostly abandoned....

<p>perl.com belongs to Tom Christiansen and he let's O'Reilly use it.  We don't have any control over that.  Maybe O'Reilly would let us do something with it, but it's potentially a valuable enough domain name that they might be loathe to do that.</p>

If Tom owns it, can we get it back from O'Reilly?

<p>That's up to Tom and whatever contract they have.</p>
