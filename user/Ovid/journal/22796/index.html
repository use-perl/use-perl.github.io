<div class="span8">
<p><p>There may not be much Perl content here, but this really is about Perl.  I've ported virtually all of this to Perl, right down to the bugs.</p>

<p>As it turns out, my predicate logic code will do the first unification but fails to handle successive unifications.  It could be something silly.  It could be something profound.  I have no idea which.</p>

<p>At first I worked out all of the bugs by carefully stepping through the Java and Perl code side by side, but this particular bug is one that I have in the Java code, too.  What's even more irritating is that the <a href="http://goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/user/winikoff/wp/">Java applet</a> does <em>not</em> have this bug.  It's only when I remove it from the applet and try to run it as a stand alone application do things fail.  So I have two piece of Java code that should report the same results, but don't and I have no idea why.  I'm stumped.</p>

<p>If anyone thinks they find the bug, here's what I have done (twice!).  Download the <a href="http://goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/%7Ewinikoff/wp/WProlog.java">source</a> and strip out the applet code.  Then strip it down until you can run the following code:</p>

<pre>import java.util.*;

public class Append {
    public static Term        query;
    public static ParseString p;
    public static Engine      eng;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            p     = new ParseString("append(X,Y,[a,b,c,d]).");
            query = new Term(p);
        } catch (Exception f) {
            System.out.println("Can't parse query!");
        }
        if (query != null) {
            try {
                eng = new Engine(query,
                    ParseString.consult(
                        "append([],X,X)."
                      + "append([W|X],Y,[W|Z]) :- append(X,Y,Z).",
                        new Hashtable()
                        // the final argument is no longer required
                    )
                );
                eng.start(); // prints first result
                eng.more();  // prints 'No.'
            } catch (Exception f) {
                System.out.println("Can't parse program!");
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>

<p>What's really strange is the result of <tt>engine.more()</tt> prints before the result of <tt>engine.start()</tt>.  I suppose that's a hint, but I still can't figure it out.</p>

<p>As for the <a href="
http://goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/%7Ewinikoff/wp/">applet</a>, click the "append" button and enter <tt>append(X,Y,[a,b,c,d])</tt> in the query box.  When you click <tt>Run Query</tt>, it will give the same results as <tt>eng.start()</tt>, but when you click <tt>More?</tt> button it keeps returning results until there are no more results.</p>

<p>In fact, just to make it easy, I even have a <a href="http://users.easystreet.com/ovid/downloads/WProlog.java">downloadable version of mine</a>.  Just compile and run it.</p></p>

<h2>Thread issue</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/briac/">briac</a> on 2005-01-20T08:12:57</h3>
<p>At first glance, it seems related to the fact that the Engine class extends Thread. As I understand it, your main() method calls more() even though start() may not have finished yet.</p>

<p>I guess this is not happenning in the Applet since the more() button is handled by a button.</p>

<p>As it turns out, this was the problem.  Someone over on Live Journal pointed out the issue and the exact spot where the problem was occurring and I fixed it and uploaded a new version.  Now I just need to find out why my Perl version is failing<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(</p>
