<div class="span8">
<p><p>There's some, er, discussion as to the best way to follow XP here at work.  While everyone acknowledges that we don't follow XP terribly well, there's considerable disagreement as to what XP actually is.  Further, much of the disagreement seems to stem from people repeating anecdotes about XP rather than learning for themselves.  Today's anecdote was "XP says you're not supposed to think about the future."</p>

<p>I replied "no, XP doesn't say that.  It says that you <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/early.html">should not add unrequested features in anticipation of future changes</a>."</p>

<p>What's your take on this and what other XP myths do you have to deal with?</p></p>

<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2003-10-28T21:22:44</h3>
The issue I run into day-to-day is building in hooks for future needs.  You don't want to build code that can't be easily modified, but nor do you need a plug-in framework based on future conjecture.

<p>There's also an open source myth in there somewhere.  (I should be writing that article, not eating a candy bar and reading use Perl;.)</p>

<p>There was a discussion on Perl Monks today about access checking.  The poster just needed to check if a given user name is in the list of admins.  That's pretty simple: just a hash look up.</p>

<p>While I normally use <tt>exists</tt> to avoid autovivification issues, one poster claimed that that was bad design.  "What if you add administrative levels in the future and one of those levels is zero?  You'll have to change all of that code.  You should just check the truth of the operation."  (In my less charitable moods, I practice witty rejoinders such as "What if Martians invade and their character set doesn't even fit within UTF-32?"  I'm not sure what UTF-32 is, but it sounds particularly nasty, even for Unicode.)</p>

<p>I instead favor encapsulating that check in one place, behind a sensible function name, where it can be changed <em>if</em> it ever needs to be changed.  Give me good encapsulation, suitable abstraction, and well-factored code in favor of a "framework" any day!</p>

<p>Andy's comments about frameworks precipitated my comment.</p>

<p>I now believe very strongly that trying to build a framework is almost always a mistake.  Compare successful frameworks and toolkits (GTK, APR) to unsuccessful ones (Mozilla's GRE, Worldforge, lots of things coming out of the JCP or even the W3C these days).  The successful ones all grew out of existing successful projects and were generalized to work with other projects.  The unsuccessful ones were designed as frameworks and haven't really met the need for anything.  (While I'm a big fan of the Mozilla browser, ask the mozdev folks about their experiences trying to build anything on XPCOM or XUL and keeping it up to date.  Similarly, XML Schema tries to solve every problem you might ever have, except for the fact that strong static typing in hierarchical text s at least as bad as the alternative.)</p>

<p>Yes, the article is intended to be a polemic.  I'm not doing this just to stir up controversy, though.  I really believe what I write.  I'm doing it because I think we should start doing smarter things, or, at least, stop doing some dumb things.  That includes myself.</p>

<p>You don't have to wait for the article to criticize my postings, but I'm very much not interested in arguing against open development.  Nor will I discuss closed development &mdash; I find it awfully handwavey to make vague pronouncements about proprietary software when I can't watch most of it being developed.</p>

<p>I can, however, watch lots of open source projects (including those in which I participate) for good things and bad things.  That's what I will discuss.</p>

<p>I have no intent of insulting the intelligence of anyone who holds these ideas.  I could very well be wrong and may change my views tomorrow.  Time will tell how well that works.</p>

<p>The original journal entry was about XP myths.  The poster didn't mean there was anything wrong with XP; he just meant that there are some often misunderstood things about it.

<p>Yes, that's exactly it.  We like to build frameworks for the sake of building frameworks.  I think that doesn't work as often as we seem to believe it does, given how often we do it.  Andy and I (and probably Ovid) have seen the same thing trip up XP shops, too.  It's not limited to the open source community.</p>

<p>Oh, and I think the most important word of the title (as for the implications it has on the tone) is "ourselves".</p>

<p>Apparently you see something radically different in that title from what I see.  When I see "open source developers," I don't see someone singling out open source developers; I see someone ignoring proprietary development because he and his audience could care less if they do well or not.  The article title, to me, is obviously about improving the quality of open source development, not denigrating it.</p>

<p>What's ironic about that song is that Ms. Morisette clearly didn't understand irony.  Virtually none of the situations she discusses are ironic.</p>

Actually, I don't really agree that the song doesn't express irony.  It expresses what's known as <i>dramatic irony</i>.<br> <p>Also, the "good advice that you just didn't take" is ironic in the rhetorical sense.  It's an ironic twist on the meaning of "good advice".<br> </p><p>Lastly, even if you don't think there's any "real" irony in the song, there's the ultimate irony, that you pointed out, that it's about irony but it's not.</p>

The problem with Perl for this sort of thing is you run smack bang into the issue of the amount of cruft you need to write to get your encapsulated method up and running.<br> <code> <br>sub is_an_admin {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my($self, $user) = @_;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exists $self-&gt;{admins}{$user}; # Or whatever<br>}<br> </code> <br>When you're encapsulating a one line test that's an awful lot of stuff, but if you want maintainability you just have to bite the bullet (and the performance hit). Roll on Perl 6.<br> <code> <br>method is_an_admin { exists %.admins{$^user} }<br> </code> <br>However, I would like to add a loud "Hear! Hear!" to your main point.

<h2>More myths</h2>

<p>Hmm... I've come across too many to mention. Particularly common ones include:</p>

<ul>

<li>"Pair programming doesn't work" said by people who have never tried it (I also believe there are people who actually cannot get along pair programming - but that's a different group from those who have never tried it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</li>

<li>"YAGNI/Do the simplest thing will result in bloated inefficient code" - because they completely ignore the whole refactoring bit.</li>

<li>"You cannot schedule a project properly" - because they didn't actually read that whole bit on release planning. This is one of those things I really want to jump up and down about. My XP(ish) experiences have given me <em>much</em> better results on the scheduling front.</li>

<li>"We cannot integrate more than once a week, it takes too long" - not realising that if they integrated a couple of times a day they wouldn't get the problems that mean they only do it once a week.</li>

<li>"We need to work 60 hour weeks to meet the deadline" - no you don't. Really. You don't. You end up working slower.</li>

<p>It seems odd to me that people can go and read the white book and just forget half of what was written there. Most odd.</p>
