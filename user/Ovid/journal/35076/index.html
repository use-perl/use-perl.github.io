<p><p>Test results currently look something like this:</p>

<pre>t/foo.t................. ok
t/bar.t................. ok
t/baz.t................. 23/?
#   Failed test at t/baz.t line 9
# Looks like you failed 2 tests out of 23
t/baz.t................. Dubious, test ...</pre>

<p>Why do we do this instead of outputting TAP (using the proposed <a href="http://testanything.org/wiki/index.php/TAP_diagnostic_syntax">YAML diagnostics</a>)?</p>

<pre>ok 1     - t/foo.t
ok 2     - t/bar.t
not ok 3 - t/baz.t
  ---
  failed:
    - 2
    - 11
  ...</pre>

<p>And we could even add diagnostics for the non-failing tests.  This
could be an alternate output, but now instead of external tools having
to try and parse our ad-hoc Test::Harness output, we could have an
alternate machine read-able output that those tools could use.  Now if
only we had a useful way to read that output ...</p>

<p>Of course, this would be <em>optional</em> output, not the default. I think this could simplify a lot of "meta" testing issues we seem to have.  Of course, you could say "but the new Test::Harness provides that information anyway!"  The problem is that it's not easy to stream this data to a remote machine or persist it for later.  Being able to persist it as TAP would be useful (<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/TAP-Harness-Archive/">TAP::Harness::Archive</a> is a different attempt to solve a similar problem).</p></p>

I'd wondered this myself in the past.  It also occurs to me that it would be pretty keen to allow a verbose TAP-2-TAP harness to emit the contents of the individual tests as groups, so that your tests 1, 2, 3 could be expanded to three groups showing the results of the tests as a whole.  If I recall correctly, groups are arbitrarily nestable, so a series of harnesses could run a very large test suite, producing a single comprehensive TAP document.<br><br>It would also be pretty keen to attach some metadata to each group, indicating monikers for rerunnable tests.  Then one could write a nice little web or curses TAP browser with the ability to re-queue failed test groups on various levels.  Then, plug that into Smolder...<br><br>I really need to make some more time to tap at this problem.

I think this a neat idea worth pursuing further.
