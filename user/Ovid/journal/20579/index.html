<p>Yeah, but you're not in beautiful Portland<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  I've already turned down a shot at a beautiful opportunity in the Bay area because it's so nice here.</p>

<h2>Salary</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/zatoichi/">zatoichi</a> on 2004-08-26T16:21:54</h3>
I wish there were at least a range as that would be a big "if" in my deciding to move to even beautiful Oregon.

<p>Apply! If they offer you a salary that doesn't meet your expectations, you can always refuse (of course, it pays to remember that Portland is cheaper than many major cities.)</p>

My general policy is: "If they aren't willing to tell you the price up front, it's too much." (which is the inverse of the old "If you have to ask the price, you can't afford it.").<p>
On a web site, that means that if I have to pretend to order something to even find the price, I just go back to the search page and on to the next web site.</p><p>
Since I'm not particularly looking for a job, I'm not going to a lot of bother to see whether has any chance of paying enough to to make me put a resume together and or even ask my wife about moving somewhere, etc.</p>

<p>To be quite honest, I agree with you completely.  If I am looking for a job, I'm far more interested in those who are willing to say up front what they'll pay.  However, I've no authority to post a salary range (I wish I did.)</p>

<h2>cross-price elasticity of demand  ;-)</h2>

<blockquote><div> <tt>The coffee market is represented by the following demand and supply conditions:<br> <br>Qd = a - bP<br>Qs = c + dP + H + T<br>Qd = Qs<br>Where H is an exogenous variable that represents the current harvest conditions, while T is an exogenous variable that represents the level of taxation on producers. P and Q are the price and quantity of coffee, while b represents the price elasticity of demand for coffee and d represents the price elasticity of supply for coffee.<br> <br>The reduced form equations (solving for P and Q) determine the equilibrium price and output level.<br> <br>P = (a - c - H - T) / (d + b)<br>Qd = a - b ((a - c - H - T) / (d + b))<br> <br>The tea market is represented by the following demand and supply conditions:<br> <br>Qdt = e - fPt + gP<br>Qstt = x + jPt<br>Qdt = Qst<br>Where Pt is the price of tea, P is the price of coffee, f is the price elasticity of demand for tea, j is the price elasticity of supply for tea, and g is the cross price elasticity of demand for tea with respect to the price of coffee.

I'm actually looking for a job right now and I've seen a lot of really good Perl postings -- yours and Andy's in particular. Add to that other really cool places to work that might have openings for the right person (like bivio or ticketmaster). But none is in Pittsburgh; we live near family and just bought a house, so no relocation for us. Not that you or anyone can do anything about it, it's just frustrating.

<p>Lots of Java positions around here though, some of them are even interesting...</p>

You should see how things are in Portugal... most people here that do Perl do it for fun... The others are in universities or in a couple of companies...<br> <br>Sigh... I wish there were more Perl jobs in Portugal<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(
