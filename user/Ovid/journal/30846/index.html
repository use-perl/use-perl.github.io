<p><p>I just got back home to Nottingham after three days at <a href="http://birmingham2006.com/">YAPC::Europe</a>.  The conference was great and as an official representative of TPF, I got an earful.  Fortunately, most of the earful was good, though not all of it.  I'm too tired to post anything now, but there will be a complete summary on the <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/">TPF Blog</a> soon -- both the good and the bad.</p>

<p>In other news, I am now in possession of <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com/Shirt/">Schwern's shirt</a>.</p></p>

<h2>Yet Another Shirt of Schwern</h2>

I'm pretty certain that although the shirt looks hideously similar to the touring one it is actually a different shirt as I had previously had it in my possession since I acquired it at Y::E 2002 in Munich.

<p>Hmm, this is quite interesting.  I'm looking at the shirt closely and it is not, in fact, the same as in the photos, despite being billed as Schwern's shirt.  Have the YAPC::Europe organizers foisted off a counterfeit shirt, or has another shirt surfaced?  We should let the shirts duke it out at some point.</p>

You can rest assured that the shirt you have is genuinely a former shirt of Schwern as I saw him take it off, I think he went back to his hotel after the auction in Munich in just his underwear as his jeans got sold too. I'm sure there were other witnesses. The worrying part is that he would have two such similar shirts of course<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
