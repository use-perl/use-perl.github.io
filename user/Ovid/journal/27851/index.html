<div class="span8">
<p><p>So I stumbled across the following:</p>

<pre>sub schema_for_class {
  my ( $self, $class ) = @_;
  return grep { $_ }
    $self->table_for_class($class),
    $self->indexes_for_class($class),
    $self->constraints_for_class($class),
    $self->view_for_class($class),
    $self->insert_for_class($class),
    $self->update_for_class($class),
    $self->delete_for_class($class);
}</pre>

<p>That's a lot of repetition and therefore a lot of noise.  So I reworked it a bit.</p>

<pre>sub schema_for_class {
  my ( $self, $class ) = @_;
  return
    grep { $_ }
      map {
        my $method = "${_}_for_class"; 
        $self->$method($class)
      } qw(
        table
        indexes
        constraints
        view
        insert
        update
        delete
      );
}</pre>

<p>Now I feel like a maintenance programmer can glance at it and get an idea of what's going on.  But I do worry that sometimes I'm refactoring so aggressively that maybe it's getting too abstract.  I do try and find a balance.  I'm just not sure that I balance quite where others do.</p></p>

<h2>A Fine Refactoring</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2005-12-04T07:44:32</h3>
<p>I did a similar refactoring just tonight with far fewer similar method names.</p>

<p>With all due respect, I know <em>you're</em> going to get it.  I've seen your work (hell, I've worked with you) and I know that you won't blink when you see that.  I just worry about the poor maintenance programmer.  I'm not too terribly worried as I think that the maintenance programmer who works on this code had better be pretty damned nimble with the Perl chainsaw in the first place, but then, I'm so used to seeing this that I've no idea if it's obscure or not.</p>

<h2>Drawing the line</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/robin/">robin</a> on 2005-12-04T16:03:05</h3>
You're right that different people will draw the line in different places. I think that the original is actually better code, because it's immediately obvious what it does. The refactored version requires a bit of &#8220;decoding&#8221;.<p>

The important thing is that you&#8217;re thinking about it rather than just refactoring it because you can. (And I guess that this example must be close to your own borderline, or you wouldn't be asking about it.)</p>

I agree that the original is better as well, unless the refactored version is significantly faster somehow (and that's an oft repeated operation).

Thirded. The new version is much more abstract for no really good reason that I could see.<br><br>&#x2014;Theory

Fourthed.  The second version is worse for searchability -- say, if I want to find all instances of "delete_for_class" in my code.<br>

<p>Only if he actually composes them as strings. <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=29689;cid=44988" title="perl.org">The version I posted</a perl.org> has the clever bits save for interpolation, and searchability wouldn&#8217;t suffer with it.</p>

Fifthed: You shouldn't put method names in vars unless you absolutely have to.

<h2>unnecessary</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lachoy/">lachoy</a> on 2005-12-04T18:58:02</h3>
fifthed: IMO you've taken something very straightforward and made it something to stumble over for no real benefit. And Chris's note about making your method calls ungreppable (or ctaggable) should make this an easy undo.

<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2005-12-04T21:57:41</h3>
<p>I share your instinct and to refactor this, but your refactored version would strike me as odd immediately upon finding it: why <code>grep { $_ } map { $foo }</code> when that&#8217;s exactly the same as <code>grep { $foo }</code>?</p>

<p>And I think the interpolation is just too clever. It also makes it unnecessarily hard to add or remove method calls that may not follow this naming scheme, should that ever be necessary. So I&#8217;d simply say</p> <blockquote> <div><tt>sub schema_for_class {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $self = shift;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my ( $class ) = @_;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return grep {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $method = $_;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $self-&gt;$method( $class );<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; } qw(<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; table_for_class<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; indexes_for_class<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; constraints_for_class<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; view_for_class<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; insert_for_class<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; update_for_class<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; delete_for_class<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; );<br>}</tt></div> </blockquote> <p>(This is another case where I wish that aliasing constructs other than <code>foreach</code> made it possible to name the iterator instead of leaving it at &#8220;<code>$_</code> is what&#8217;s for dinner, bud.&#8221;)</p>

Isn't the return value from your version simply going to be:<br>qw(<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; table_for_class<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; indexes_for_class<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; constraints_for_class<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; view_for_class<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; insert_for_class<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; update_for_class<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; delete_for_class<br>);<br>?<br><br>You can't introduce side affects in a grep block.  $_ always comes out the left side regardless of what happens inside the grep block (which is why you would want a grep {$_} map {$foo} pattern).

<p>Ack! Of <em>course</em>. Sigh.

</p><p>I guess one could use</p> <blockquote> <div><tt>map {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $method = $_;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $self-&gt;$method( $class ) || ();<br>} @method;</tt></div> </blockquote> <p>but I&#8217;m not sure how well advised that is&#8230;</p>
