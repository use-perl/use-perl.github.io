<p><p><tt>&lt;rant&gt;</tt>I can't tell you how many times I've worked on applications where I try to run Perl's debugger and the debugger just freezes.  I've never used a debugger in any other language which is so fragile<tt>&lt;/rant&gt;</tt> :(</p></p>

Due to the overhead the debugger adds to processing times?  That's bit me, sometimes to the extent that it basically hangs... in such cases, if the intensive bit is essential to the debugging, I'll swear at it; otherwise I'll just snip out that part.  And swear, also.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>I've wondered if it's just taking longer, but no, it's really hanging.  And this is a huge system and figuring out what part it's hanging on is a chore in and of itself.</p>

Does anything happen when you hit CTRL-C?  Typically if something is taking forever when I'm debugging, I can hit CTRL-C and the debugger will stop at whatever point it's at.  If it's indeed hanging and not just running really slow this might not do any good I guess...

<p>No, it doesn't stop when I hit CTRL-C.  I have to do a <tt>ps</tt> to get the process id and then kill it.</p>

We've got some fiendish contraption that we use to bootstrap our projects (get @INC setup, etc) at work.  Except that it causes the debugger to blow up in URI::_generic.  It's exceedingly weird.  Some time I will try and figure out what's going on, but it's very frustrating.

<p>What's worse is that I'm the only person who has ever noticed...

Interesting coincidence -- had the same thing happen when trying to run a self-written Catalyst plugin through the debugger. It also gave errors in URI::_generic..

Freezes?  Hell, Want.pm *crashes* the debugger.
