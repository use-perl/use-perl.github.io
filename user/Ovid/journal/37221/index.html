<h1>Test::Kit Plans and YAPC::EU Surprise</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>I've received some <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Ovid/journal/37181">nice feedback</a> about <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Kit/">Test::Kit</a>.  A number of people at YAPC::EU also told me it sounded interesting, so I made the mistake of promising I'd have an alpha out by conference end.  I made that deadline, but now there's a lot of work to do.  I have three main things resolve:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add some missing test features</li>
  <li>Clean up internals (don't look.  Sausage manufacturing looks wonderful in comparison)</li>
  <li>Write a Cookbook</li>
</ol>

<p>In particular, while it's possible to create something just like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Most/">Test::Most</a>, it's not particularly easy, so the first thing I need to do is eat my own dog food.</p>

<p>Regarding YAPC::EU, I was astonished when the Lisbon, Portugal delegation opened their talk with <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/1424008">my promotional video for a Lisbon YAPC</a>.  Sitting in a lecture hall with a few hundred people and watching your video on a large screen can be a wee bit intimidating.  Fortunately, it went over well and people laughed in the right places (whew).  I'll have to do more.  That would be fun.  Anybody want a video for a conference? :)</p>

<p>In other news, the Copenhagen conference was fantastic and, once again, I'm terribly impressed with what the organizers put together.  They're a tough act to follow.</p></p>
