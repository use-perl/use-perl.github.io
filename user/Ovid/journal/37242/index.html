<p>Both of us found this much cleaner.  However, this might have unexpected consequences.  It also highlights the issue of Test::Harness's long-standing practice of stripping the .t extension from filenames.  Why?  If we want other extensions, stripping them is probably bad.</p></p>

CPAN::Reporter ignores that and just looks for the grade at the end, so green light from me.<br><br>What do you do if the test file name is longer than your fixed column width?<br><br>t/something/something-else/with-a-long-long-long-long-test-name.t<br><br>-- dagolden

<p>The width of the reporting is based on the width of the test names, so it expands as needed.</p>

Good. Now I can finally stop sticking to 72/80 in my perl source files too. Use a different editor/console!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>
While we are on the topic of Test::Harness output,  a change that I'd like to see is padding of the test number so that test comments are aligned.
</p><p>
For example consider the following trimmed down test program and output:
</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>use Test::More tests =&gt; 11;<br> <br>for (1<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.. 11) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; is(1, 1, 'This is a comment');<br>}<br> <br>__END__<br> <br>perl output1.t<br>1..11<br>ok 1 - This is a comment<br>ok 2 - This is a comment<br>ok 3 - This is a comment<br>ok 4 - This is a comment<br>ok 5 - This is a comment<br>ok 6 - This is a comment<br>ok 7 - This is a comment<br>ok 8 - This is a comment<br>ok 9 - This is a comment<br>ok 10 - This is a comment<br>ok 11 - This is a comment</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>
I'd prefer to see that aligned something like the following so that the comments were aligned (using something like "%-4d"):
</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>ok 1&nbsp; &nbsp; - This is a comment<br>ok 2&nbsp; &nbsp; - This is a comment<br>ok 3&nbsp; &nbsp; - This is a comment<br>ok 4&nbsp; &nbsp; - This is a comment<br>ok 5&nbsp; &nbsp; - This is a comment<br>ok 6&nbsp; &nbsp; - This is a comment<br>ok 7&nbsp; &nbsp; - This is a comment<br>ok 8&nbsp; &nbsp; - This is a comment<br>ok 9&nbsp; &nbsp; - This is a comment<br>ok 10&nbsp; &nbsp;- This is a comment<br>ok 11&nbsp; &nbsp;- This is a comment</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>
I usually put some work into having good test comments and having them left aligned is important to me.
</p><p>
To workaround this I usually format my comments with a leading "\s\t":
</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>use Test::More tests =&gt; 11;<br> <br>for (1<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.. 11) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; is(1, 1, " \tThis is a comment");<br>}<br> <br>__END__<br> <br>perl output2.t<br>1..11<br>ok 1 -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a comment<br>ok 2 -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a comment<br>ok 3 -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a comment<br>ok 4 -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a comment<br>ok 5 -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a comment<br>ok 6 -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a comment<br>ok 7 -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a comment<br>ok 8 -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a comment<br>ok 9 -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a comment<br>ok 10 -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is a comment<br>ok 11 -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is a comment</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>
Do you think that there would be any appetite for this change?

<p>I like this thought because things which improves comprehension are good, but there are a couple of issues here.  First, many test descriptions (what you're referring to as a comment), are often close to the width of whatever terminal I'm working with, so pushing them out even further may be problematic.  Second, since we don't always know up front how many tests will be run, we won't know what padding would be needed.</p><p>However, rather than a specific solution like this, how about a more general one?</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>prove -rv --format='%s %4s - %s' t/</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>The danger is that passing in a format means you can easily break TAP:</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>prove -rv --format='%2$s %1$4s - %3$s' t/</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>There's not much we could do to stop that, but it might just be a <em>caveat emptor</em> situation.</p>

<blockquote><div><p>There&#8217;s not much we could do to stop that</p></div> </blockquote><p>You could generate a test message with this format and try to parse it and see that the parts all where you expected them. (Should the parts be randomly generated so the user can&#8217;t fool you?) If that fails you tell the user that their format is no good and bail.</p>
