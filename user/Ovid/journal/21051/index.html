<p><p><a href="http://www.eliyon.com/">Eliyon</a> is apparently a search engine that is used for finding employees of a company and find out where people have been employed.  It still has a few kinks to work out.  While correctly determining that I used to work for <a href="http://www.maserith.com/">Maserith Information Systems</a> and that I'm (theoretically) a consultant with <a href="http://www.onyxneon.com/">Onyx Neon</a> (though I've never actually done work for them), it also seems to think that I work for Perlmonks as an editor and programmer and I am the Chairman of the  Walker County Republican Party.</p>

<p>Uh, no.</p>

<p>Still, it's an interesting technology and it's only an invasion of privacy in the sense that people are surprised that public information is, well, public.</p></p>

<h2>Neat.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rooneg/">rooneg</a> on 2004-09-26T13:50:45</h3>
Interestingly enough it came up with three different versions of me.  All of them really do seem to be me, but they failed to link them together into one person.  Neat stuff though.



<h2>There is a company called Perl6...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Limbic Region/">Limbic Region</a> on 2004-09-26T22:50:29</h3>
because apparently I am employed by it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)



<h2>Other scary public info</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/iburrell/">iburrell</a> on 2004-09-27T01:28:57</h3>
I found another interesting site, http://contracts.onecle.com, which has sample contracts.   Actually, what they have are real contracts from real companies.  I am guessing that public companies have to provide employment contracts for their executives.

<p>
It is still very weird to read my bosses employment contract.</p>
