<p><p>The following is a legal contract from Genoa, written in the 14th century:</p>

<blockquote>...Geri, [son] of the late Ser Lapo
of Florence, Simone Guascone, [9 more Names listed], each of them
[liable] for the amount written below, have acknowledged and in truth
have declared to me, notary undersigned, as a public official [holding]
a public office, making the stipulation and receiving in the name and
stead of Federico Vivaldi, citizen of Genoa, that they have bought,
have had, and have received from him a certain amount of goods of the
said Frederico...And for these goods and in consideration of their
price each of them has promised to give and to pay to said
Frederico or to his accredited messenger: [from] the said Geri,
150 gold florins, the said Simone, 50 florins, [100 florins
each from the other Names] within the next five months from
now.   Otherwise they have promised to give and to pay
to the said Frederico the penalty of the double of it and of the
entire amount to which and to the extent of which [this agreement]
is violated or is not observed as above, together with restitution
of all losses, unrealized profits, and expenses which might be
incurred because of it in court or outside -- the
aforesaid remaining as settled, and under hypothecation and pledge
of their goods and [the goods] of any one of them, existing
and future.
<br>
<br>
[The above is binding] with the exception and special reservation
that if the amount of goods, property, and merchandise which was
loaded or is to be loaded by Frederico Imperiale or by another in
his behalf for the account of the said Frederico Vivaldi in
Aigues-Mortes -- to be transported to Ayassoluk and Rhodes or to
either of these two localities in a certain ship...and which
departed from Aigues-Mortes or is about to depart in order
to sail to aforesaid regions -- is brought and unloaded in the said
localities of Ayasoluk and Rhodes or in either of them, in safety,
then and in such a case the present intrument is cancelled, void,
and of no value and pro rata.   And be it understood that such
a risk begins when the said ship departs and sets sail from Aigues-Mortes,
and it remains and lasts, while the captain goes, stays [in port],
sails, loads and unloads, from the said locality of Aigues-Mortres
up to the said localities of Ayassoluk and Rhodes, in whatever
manner and way he wishes, until said amount of goods, property,
and merchandise has been brought and unloaded in Ayassoluk and Rhodes
or in either of these two localities in safety, and pro rata.
Let the present instrument also be cancelled if the said
Frederico refrains from asking payments of the aforesaid amounts
of money for the space of one year after the time or the time limit
has elapsed for asking or obtaining their payment....
Done as above, September 15th, around nones. [1393 A.D.]</blockquote>

<h2>Code as contracts</h2>

<p>You would probably be interested in the converse: code as contracts - </p><blockquote><div><p> <i> <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/financial-contracts/contracts-icfp.htm" title="microsoft.com">Composing contracts: an adventure in financial engineering</a microsoft.com> </i> </p></div> </blockquote><p>
Production systems based on this work (or at least this line of thought) are in use on Wall Street, except using OCaml instead of Haskell.

<p>I know someone who has code in use on Wall St using that line of thought that is written in SQL-CLR!  (You didn't know that SQL Server has a functional language embedded in it?  You're not alone!)</p>

<h2>The More Fun Question Is</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cyocum/">cyocum</a> on 2009-02-25T21:38:59</h3>
<p>Are contracts a DSL?</p>

<p>They aren't, but they do <em>use</em> domain-specific language.</p>
