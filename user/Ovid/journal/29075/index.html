<div class="span8">
<p><p>Regrettably, Monday was my last day with Kineticode.  I'll not say more about that other than David and I are both saddened that I won't be there any more (things ended on great terms).  It was fun while it lasted.  Keep your eye on Kineticode, though.  There are likely to be more good things coming out of that company.</p>

<p>So what now?  Well, I'll have a bit of time off and, if things go the way they appear to be going, I'll probably be moving to the UK (not London) in a month or two.  The work permit has been applied for and I've already started some packing.  I've no idea how likely work permits are to get denied so I suppose there's a chance that this will still fall through, but I'm acting on the assumption it won't.  My family's excited about this move and I'm quite happy about the position I'll be taking.</p>

<p>My only regret about this is the complete inability of the British to make decent Mexican good (insert obligatory British cooking joke here).  I'll probably have to make my own tortillas, tamales and salsa, though I've no idea if I can even <em>get</em> fresh cilantro and jalape&ntilde;os there.</p></p>

It's not entirely clear if the turn of events are good, bad, somewhere in  between or a bit of both.<br><br>But most change is if not good then at least exciting.  Moving continents surely is, so:  Congratulations with the upcoming move and new job.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>

<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2006-03-23T06:52:52</h3>
<p>Thanks!  This is a good thing, ultimately.  I'm very, very happy with how things are turning out.</p>

<h2>Good luck with everything</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2006-03-23T06:58:07</h3>
<p>Hope it all goes through smoothly!</p>

<p>A side question: will this affect your work for the TPF in any way?</p>



<blockquote>

<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2006-03-23T07:09:15</h3>
<p>Thanks!  And no, it shouldn't affect my TPF work.  Since virtually all of my work is done remotely, it's a non-issue.</p>

<h2>Brighton</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2006-03-23T07:21:52</h3>
Do come down to Brighton -- the food is lovely! (and fresh!)

<p>-Dom</p>



<h2>.. And Birmingham</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barbie/">barbie</a> on 2006-03-23T08:01:36</h3>
<p>Once you settled into the change of timezone, if you ever feel up to coming along to say hello or give a talk, we'll be pleased to see you.
</p><p>Hope all the moving doesn't prove too stressful, and good luck with the new job.</p>

Don't worry, you can definitely buy fresh jalape&#241;os.<br><br>I had to look up cilantro though, but it turns out you meant coriander<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;) - so yes, you can buy that freshly too (as either cut leaves in a package, or a plant in a pot)<br><br>I hope you'll let me buy you a beer if you're in the neighbourhood!<br>



<h2>Cilantro = Corriander</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2006-03-23T11:36:58</h3>
The fresh corriander available in the UK is actually far better than anything I've been able to buy in the supermarkets in Canada. I think this is party because of the north american insane dedication to growing goods LARGER than they really should be. Corriander in britain is fresher, tastier, and just generally better.<br><br>Of course you could be able to get awesome corriander/cilantro where you are, but you will not find availability of ingredients in the UK lacking. Far from it. I totally miss the selection of goods there.



<h2>So teach us!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/drhyde/">drhyde</a> on 2006-03-23T15:28:23</h3>
You're right, I don't know why but I can't think of anywhere to get decent Mexican food here.  Pretty much everything else is easy to find.  You therefore have a mission.  Teach us.  Start by teaching me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>True about the mexican food...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Adrian/">Adrian</a> on 2006-03-24T09:28:10</h3>
... although Paris Texas (I think that was the name?) In Brighton wasn't too bad before it burned down...<br><br>That said - compared to the stuff you can get in Brum or Coventry curries in the US are a joke<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>mexican?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cyclist38/">cyclist38</a> on 2006-03-24T10:09:03</h3>
It's also hard to find good Mexican food in the U.S., though Tex-Mex and Southwestern American is dang good. As to the U.K., you'll be much happier feasting on curries. I have found since moving to The Netherlands that, much like in the UK, there are plenty of great places to eat, and lots of choices, but Mexican aint one of 'em.

<p>Bah.  You're the second person to tell me that I'm going to love the curries.  I've never had a taste for Indian food no matter how "good" the restaurant my friends have dragged me to (and they've dragged me to several just to prove me wrong).</p>

<h3><a href="/user/cyclist38/">cyclist38</a> on 2006-03-24T15:36:56</h3>
sorry, i had no idea<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) it's been rough here in the Netherlands as well and have had to resort to making all my own mexican food (quesadillas, burritos, even salsa!).

<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2006-03-24T20:28:50</h3>
<p>I certainly understand that.  When I was working in Amsterdam, my boss took me to a Mexican restaurant in Haarlem.  The "salsa" tasted like ketchup with spices and my enchiladas were so tough that I had trouble cutting them with a knife.  Very sad.</p>
