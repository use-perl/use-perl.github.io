<h2>NFL versus the church</h2>

Thanks for the links.  I could say a lot about this issue, but the most bizarre aspect that I noticed was a section in the second link where it is noted that the NFL admitted that it doesn't go after bars that violate the league's written rules about use of its broadcasts.  Regardless of one's religiosity, I would think that one would agree that cracking down on a church that wants to show the Super Bowl to its patrons but letting bars off the hook demonstrates a rather perverse mentality.

<p>Yes, the whole "bars good, churches bad" thing was sad.  I doubt they really did that intentionally, but it was a stunning piece of bad PR.</p>

<h2>taking the rod to the sinner</h2>

No, it's just 'large bands of burly ruffians' castigating sinners for watching football in church, not even aware of their transgressions against the lord or the law.<br><br>The drinkers in the bars are going to hell, anyway. The rod of the law would have no effect on them.
