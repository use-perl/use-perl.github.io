<p><p>Both of my <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Ovid/journal/35570">OSCON proposals</a> were rejected.  This raises a big question mark about whether I'll be able to attend this year.  Damn.</p></p>

<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2008-03-26T23:39:25</h3>
I've noticed that, unlike YAPC, OSCON talks mostly need to deal with "buzzy" issues, and be more about shiny new products, or new ideas, rather than teaching people about programming practices...<br><br>YAPC remains far superior to OSCON in that area.<br><br>

Yeah, you're 100% right in your assessment.<br><br>I'm somewhat upset that my two talks were also rejected.  I was really looking forward to presenting them, since I'm not going to have time to talk at YAPC::NA this year.

<h2>Rejected here also</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Phred/">Phred</a> on 2008-03-27T16:13:47</h3>
<p>Both my talks were rejected also.  One I thought was pretty solid, I've given it a few places and gotten very positive responses.</p>
<p>A definite bummer, I have wanted to attend OSCON for several years but this is the second year my proposal didn't get accepted.  Seeing as how I am self employed right now paying my own way is not likely even with the 25% discount I get as a rejected speaker.</p>
<p>It would be nice if OSCON offered a discount for open source contributers who run small shops like me (hint hint).</p>
