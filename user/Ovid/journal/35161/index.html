<div class="span8">
<p><p>My <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-JSON/">Test::JSON</a> currently has 2 failures out of 106 test reports sent.  One failure appears to be a messed up Perl installation, but the one I received yesterday is due to the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/JSON/">JSON</a> module being updated in a non-backwards compatible way.  Apparently, there was a deprecation period of a whopping <em>twelve days</em> (going by the date of the first release of the new API to 2.0).  I had not heard that there was going to be a new API and the author has made it clear that he won't support the old API.</p>

<p>Now I'll have to get a new release of <tt>Test::JSON</tt> out the door.  Do I go through the trouble of allowing it to support the older <tt>JSON</tt> module in addition to the new API?  I might.  Frankly, I'm frustrated to be caught completely off guard by such a radical change in this important module, though I realize I'm not the first.  But a twelve day deprecation period is ridiculous.  And was this even at least announced anywhere?  I might even look to switching to a different JSON module with an author who is less likely to pull the rug out from under me so quickly.</p></p>

I currently have failing tests with JSON::Any because JSON::XS decided to make a similar (not the same mind you but related) API change without a deprecation period *at all* (and in a point release no less!).<br><br>So really what would the alternative be?

<p>:(</p>

<p>This is very frustrating.  I guess I really can't recommend anything.  I'd be tempted to say <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/JSON-Syck/" title="cpan.org">JSON::Syck</a cpan.org> as Tatsuhiko's pretty sharp and is unlikely to break everyone's code without warning, but I see there are a number of serious bug reports and it doesn't appear to be widely used<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:/</p>

Well I just fixed JSON::Any to work, and since I didn't have to change a single test I suspect I'm 100% backwards compatible to what you're running. Sooo<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... might I suggest JSON::Any?

Wow. I would have been kicking holes in walls and frothing at the mouth trying to debug if I hadn't seen your post, and wandered over to CPAN. "He couldn't <i>possibly</i> mean the 2 <b>main</b> methods in the module...could he ?"
<p>
Yep.
</p><p>
I think I've just discovered a new definition of arbitrary and capricious. But it appears the author has backed off for a bit...and will instead grace us with nagging warnings.</p>

<p>Ah, that's a relief.  I'll take the warnings over the breakage any day of the week<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Heh, at first I read the word in the subject of the comment as &#8220;headsoup&#8221; &#8211; and considering the issue at hand, that would be apt enough&#8230;</p>
