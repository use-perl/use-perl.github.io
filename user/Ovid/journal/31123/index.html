<p><p>You may have noticed that Pudge has an <a href="http://pudge.net/ask/">Ask Pudge</a> page.  His <a href="http://pudge.net/ask/audio/Episode-009.mp3">last podcast</a>, as of this writing, makes it clear why it's not worth listening to.  He claims that liberals are driven by "wishful thinking" and and "the notion that we can make life on Earth perfect" and "[maybe] we can all have a Star Trek like existence".</p>

<p>Yup.  That's his view on liberals.  Conservatives, of course, are the sober, realistic individuals who, unlike liberals, actually think about things.</p>

<p>Silly me.  I stupidly thought that disparate value systems might lead people to reach different conclusions about the relative merits of varying political and economic systems.  Not so!  Clearly no liberal has thought about the merit of their positions.  It's all wishful thinking.  I'm so grateful that Pudge has shown me the light.</p>

<p>(Mind you, if that's not his view on liberals, he shouldn't have said it.  But you can listen to the podcast yourself and see if I'm misrepresenting him.)</p></p>

I found it rather offensive. I also loved how he defined a "just war" as one where you "really believe" the made-up facts against Iraq (and then goes on a rant about violating sanctions, yet these were UN sanctions and the UN did not authorise this war). Presumably made up facts about Iran will also be justification for an invasion.<br><br>Yeah that makes a whole lot of sense now - GWB really believed all those "facts", so it MUST be Just.

What I said was that you can define it either way.  If going into Iraq is to stop Hussein from doing something terrible, that is Just, according to the Just War Theory.  This is a given.

My point was about the Just War Theory, which couldn't care less about such trivialities as whether the UN authorizes it or not.  And again: if you believe that Hussein was going to cause great harm unless he is stopped by force, the war was arguably Just, acc. to the JWT.  If not, then it was arguably not, acc. to that Theory.<br><br><em>Presumably made up facts about Iran will also be justification for an invasion.</em><br><br>I personally never believed for sure that Iraq had WMD (and am on record before the invasion saying so), and certainly never used the purported WMD as justification for invading Iraq, so it's funny that you're attacking the "made up facts" as though that hurts me personally in some way.<br><br>Presumably when I do talk about Iran at some point, you will make up things I didn't say then, too<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... ?<br>

<em>You're very careful to not say whether or not you think it is or isn't a Just war.</em><br><br>Correct.  The reason is simple: because I am not entirely sure, and even to the extent I think it is, I wouldn't try to convince anyone else.<br><br>Just because I am opinionated doesn't mean I have come to a conclusion about everything, or that I would attempt to convince others of all my opinions.<br><br><em>If you believe that it wasn't Just based on your reasoning then please feel free to respond to this comment indicating so.</em><br><br>There is no "fact" about whether it was a Just War.  It's a matter of perspective.  I respect (and disagree) with the perspective that it was Just and that we should have gone in because of WMD (since I didn't believe in the WMD).  I also respect (and disagree) with the perspective that it was Unjust because there was no legitimate and good interest in our invasion.<br><br>My personal view is a bit more complex (and has remain unchanged since months before the invasion): that in order for us to achieve long-term security, we need to help foster a transformation of the Middle East to increase both economic and political liberty in the region, and that a great first step to that was removing one of the biggest evils and destabilizing influences in the region, which was preventing it from progressing: Saddam Hussein.<br><br><em>Otherwise your lack of criticism of your administration (of whom you're a very public and vocal supporter of, yet critical on other matters) enforces my view that you believe this is a Just War.</em><br><br>I've criticized the administration on the war many times.  I criticized them in the buildup of the war for the extremely poor WMD presentation, and overall poor "marketing" of the war.  And just this month I slammed Bush for saying we are safer, when that is quite simply unknowable.<br><br>Of course, none of that means the war is not Just.  I tend to think it is, but as I've said for years: my view of this whole thing was based on a belief about what would happen if we do NOT go in (basically, a war with the entire Middle East sometime in the next several decades, that we need the aforementioned transformation to accomplish), so it's impossible for me to prove it's Just one way or another, since I can't prove my prediction would come true.  I've never once tried to convince anyone that my prediction will come true, let alone that this is is the only or best way to go about it, and so certainly won't try to convince anyone that the war is Just based on those things.<br><br><em>I can't really comment on your other points until you clear that up.</em><br><br>You can't even comment on your misrepresentation about what I actually said?  Oh, come on<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>

Certainly I can't recall any such criticisms on use.perl though maybe my memory is faulty.<br><br>Your reasoning for believing the war may be Just sadly isn't one being pushed to the world by the US administration, and as such it is rather a weak defense of the administration (in that I wish to attack the administration, not *you* by any stretch).

<em>I don't believe I did that, so what can I say?</em><br><br>So you still think I <em>defined a "just war" as one where you "really believe" the made-up facts against Iraq</em>.  Except, I didn't.  I said that that reasoning could be one justification for saying the war was Just.  But I added quickly that there was no obligation to believe those things, and that if you didn't, well, then probably, to you it wasn't Just.  I did not define what a Just War was, I simply gave one way in which you could reasonably call the war Just, and noted that it depends on your own perspective.<br><br><em>Regarding your lack of criticism of the Bush administration - perhaps I've been reading the wrong blog and if so I can apologise for my lack of knowledge on that. Certainly I can't recall any such criticisms on use.perl though maybe my memory is faulty.</em><br><br>I stopped posting political entries on this site long ago, mostly because of rampant misunderstandings and inflamed passions.  I found much more reasoned and dispassionate and interesting discussion on my Slashdot journal.<br><br><em>Your reasoning for believing the war may be Just sadly isn't one being pushed to the world by the US administration</em><br><br>Yes, it has.  Since the beginning, too.  It's just figured less prominently, and has been presented very clumsily.<br><br><em>and as such it is rather a weak defense of the administration</em><br><br>I did not intend it as a defense of the administration.  It is merely my reason for supporting the war.<br><br><em>This possible future war with the Middle East seems all too far fetched for my liking though - where is the basis for this hypothesis?</em><br><br>Watching and learning.  An increasingly radicalized subculture that is ever-expanding its borders and spreading itself through fear, suppression, terror, at such a rate and to such a degree and with such tactics that I see very little other possible outcomes if something doesn't change.  It's a complicated and involved discussion, and I don't have the time to get into it right now, but I didn't want to just brush off the question, so I hope that summary suffices.<br><br>And again, I know it's impossible to reasonably prove this view about a somewhat distant future, and I don't and won't try.  I'll only try to explain what I think and why I think it.  The most damning criticism of my view (I'll save you the trouble<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) is that because it is so hypothetical (we can argue about probability, but I won't), it's a poor reason to go to war.  To that I merely say, I think the costs are too high to take that chance.  Maybe I'm wrong.  I dunno.<br><br>The other common criticism of my view is that it didn't work: it just made things worse.  To that I say two things: a. we do not know things are actually worse, especially for the long run; b. just because I favored going in doesn't mean I favor how the whole enterprise has been handled.<br>

<em>Right now the only thing we do know is that a) things are actually worse and b) the costs have been enormous.</em><br><br>We do know b.  As to a.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... worse than what?  Worse than they would have been otherwise?  We do not know that.  It's perfectly reasonable to suppose, for example, that terrorism would be even worse had we not gone in.<br><br>For example, after the USS Cole attack, when the U.S. did not respond, that actually encouraged terrorists; if we backed down to Hussein, would that have encouraged terrorists too?  Obviously, the terrorists and Hussein are not the same thing, but neither were the terrorists the same thing as the Somalian warlords, and that too emboldened the terrorists.  And remember, of course, we didn't invade Iraq before 9/11.<br><br>But perhaps you mean that things are worse than they were before we invaded Iraq.  That's probably true (although I don't think we can know it for certain), but I think it's not very relevant, because I don't think it's reasonable to say things would be better today had we not gone in, and because I still think in the long run we will likely be better off, even if not better off in the short run.<br><br>Again, the cost question is without question, though it's again worth asking (as I did before the war) what the potential costs are if we didn't act.<br><br><em>When does it become time to say they screwed up? And not just in a small way, but in an enormous and almost incalculable way.</em><br><br>If you actually believe it, then go ahead and say it.  I still think the war's the right thing to do, as do many people who know a lot more about the war firsthand than you or I do.  Of course, many people who know a lot more than we do also think it's a terrible thing to do.  The point I am making is that reasonable and intelligent people can disagree, and the only thing that really offends me in this whole discussion is the notion (on both sides, but far more in the last year or so on the anti-war side) that if you disagree, you're stupid/evil/ignorant/etc.<br><br><em>Regarding the "Just War" issue - you have now stated it was a Just War but for entirely different reasons than given in your podcast, so I'm utterly confused about why you would even state such reasons.</em><br><br>I am utterly confused why you would be confused.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br><em>You could have just said "If you believe Saddam is ugly then it was Just", which would have had as much weight as your podcast point.</em><br><br>No, because no one holds to such a view, that I know of.<br><br>Many people, reasonably, hold (or held) to the two views I offered.  Many Democrats voted for military action because they believed that Hussein had WMD and was prepared to use them, because that is what the U.S., UK, and many other intelligence agencies believed.  So they supported the war, and thought it was Just.  Even though I disagree with them -- because I didn't accept the evidence for WMD -- I won't claim their support of the war was Unjust, because it was a reasonable conclusion based on their beliefs at the time.<br><br>I gave that reason because it is a pervasively held one.  The context was not me trying to say why the Iraq War is Just, but to give an example reason why, from a Christian perspective, the war may, arguably, be considered Just.<br><br><em>There has to be more reasoning for a Just war than just believing it was the right thing to do</em><br><br>Sure.  But it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_War" title="wikipedia.org">more complicated</a wikipedia.org> than I wanted to get into in a short podcast.  Basically, Augustine identified three elements, and this fits under the most commonly cited, "defending against an external attack."<br><br>What muddles the issue, of course, is the issue of preemption.  <a href="http://www.americanvalues.org/html/1b___pre-emption.html" title="americanvalues.org">Some have said</a americanvalues.org>, with good reason, that "within the framework of just war theory, pre-emption can be morally justified only in rare circumstances -- when the attack is likely to be imminent, the threat is grave, and preventive means other than war are unavailable."  And of course, the reported threat of WMD fit the second of those criteria quite clearly, and the first to some degree (though specific evidence was scant, one could still easily believe Iraq might use their weapons imminently); and the third is pretty subjective and could be argued either way.<br><br>I suppose I should emphasize here that I am talking about belief, as I said in the podcast.  Belief and proof are different things.  I wholeheartedly agree with those that claim that the war was not <em>proved</em> to be Just based on the WMD question, at any point.  But that doesn't mean someone cannot honestly and intelligently come to the conclusion that the war was Just based on the WMD question, according to the information available at the time.<br><br><em>and far more evidence for a possible "future war with the middle east" for killing tens of thousands of civilians.</em><br><br>Sure.  Obviously, my view doesn't fit the "imminent" criteria, but frankly, I don't find imminence to be of significant importance if the other two criteria are met (if it is a grave threat that cannot be avoided in any other way, why does it matter if the threat is imminent?  and more to the point, what if the threat must be confronted now, because if you wait until it is imminent, it is too late?)<br><br>And again, this is why I don't try to convince anyone: I believe it, but I can't prove it.  Can't even come close.  Even though I supported the war because I believe what I do, I am not so sure if I were in charge of things, I'd have pushed for war on that basis, because as the actual people in charge, you need to answer to the people<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... and I can't convince anyone of this.<br><br>(For the record, I did argue a lot prewar about the legal aspects of what was going on with the UN and Resolution 1441 and so on<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I did and do maintain the war was legally justified.  But that does not in any way make the war Just.  And I don't want to have that argument now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but in case you looked around and saw all my arguments about the international legal and political process from 2003, I didn't want you to wrongly think I was being disingenuous.  At the time, I did distinguish too, noting that even though it was legally justified, that doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.)<br><br><em>You can't just stomp all over other countries because you think they might do bad things in the future - the results are (a), above.</em><br><br>Again, you can't know things are worse now than they otherwise would have been.<br>

<em>I do not think it is reasonable to suppose that terrorism would be worse had the US not gone into Iraq. There is no connection there.</em><br><br>I'm sorry, that's just wrong.  We know the terrorists were watching our reaction to Iraq, whether we would stand up, or back down, to the implicit threat of Hussein's refusal to cooperate with UN resolutions.  We know that when we back down -- whether politically or militarily -- that it emboldens the terrorists.<br><br>(For what it's worth, the Duelfer Report also makes clear that Hussein was going to restart his WMD programs as soon as sanctions were lifted.)<br><br><em>There was no threat of "backing down" to Hussein. The UN inspection process was continuing and working.</em><br><br>This is just false.  It was continuing, and <b>not</b> working.  Hussein had already irrevocably violated Resolution 1441, with no hopes of ever coming into compliance with it.  The marker for whether inspections were working was 1441, passed unanimously by the Security Council in late 2002, and there's no way to read 1441 without coming to the conclusion that inspections had irrevocably failed.<br><br><em>I can only presume that the US hoped (or assumed) the inspections would find WMDs and thus got frustrated when they didn't.</em><br><br>No.  The clear language of 1441 forced Hussein to comply immediately and fully (he did neither), because if he did not, then the time spent in the interim could be used to try to hide any WMD they had.  The very fact that it took them months to comply fully means that 1441 had been violated, and that there was no way to trust that Iraq had no WMD, no matter how long the inspections went on.<br><br><em>So the inspection process was *clearly* working as otherwise the US troops would have found WMDs in places Saddam didn't allow the inspectors to look.</em><br><br>One has nothing to do with the other, unless you are implying the inspections process caused Hussein to hide his WMDs, which would not be a success of the process, but a failure.  Other than that possibility, there is no connection to the inspections process, and whether Hussein had weapons.<br><br>Perhaps you mean the other two parts of the process that Blix's UNMOVIC were involved with (monitoring, verification, and inspection).  Except that they'd not done any monitoring or verification (or inspections) for five years.  There's only one thing the international community did in between the time that UNMOVIC left Iraq in 1998, and went back in 2003: the U.S. bombing of Baghdad in late '98.  If anything "worked" to get rid of Hussein's weapons, it was U.S. bombs, not UNMOVIC.  UNMOVIC documents and the Duelfer Report confirm this, saying that Iraq had no WMD primarily because they were destroyed by the U.S. in '98 (this was also Iraq's claim during late 2002/early 2003: we can't account for it because you destroyed it!).<br><br>So now we get to late 2002, and the UN Resolution says, fine, you don't have WMD?  Then freeze, do not move a muscle, and prove it to us by giving us all the info you have and giving us free reign to investigate.  Failure to comply immediately and fully means you failed to prove anything.  But, Hussein stalled and pushed back.<br><br><em>So I believe things are provably worse</em><br><br>It cannot possibly be proven, because you cannot come close to proving what might have happened had we not gone in.<br><br><em>the US has pissed off a good proportion of the muslim population of the world by attacking a nation for no clear reason</em><br><br>Well, *I* think the reason is clear.  But we've already gone over that.<br><br><em>and massively increased the US debt load in doing so, which has the potential to throw most of the modern world into another depression</em><br><br>No it doesn't.  It's bad, but it's not nearly that bad.  The economy is still very strong, despite a rising debt.  This is a long-term problem that won't lead to depression, but if unchecked will lead to an ever-decreasing standard of living in the U.S., relative to our trading partners.<br><br><em>None of this is a good thing.</em><br><br>Sure, but the part you cannot prove is that it wouldn't have been worse otherwise.<br><br><em>FWIW I don't think you're stupid/evil/ignorant - well maybe a little ignorant - but that's based on the fact that I grew up with a terrorism that was finally solved, not by war, but through discussion.</em><br><br>Sure, and I think you're a little bit ignorant (not because of your opinions, because of some of your facts, such as enumerated above about inspections working).  OBL and al Qaeda are completely unwilling to have discussion.  Either we comply with their ever-changing demands, or they try to kill us.  There's no negotiation to be had.

<p> <i>Was more required to make the world safe?</i> </p>

<p>There's a very thin shade of difference in definitions here, so parse this answer closely: no, more was not required to make the world safe, but more was required in order to determine that the world was, in fact, safe.</p>

<p> <i>You forgot to say "within the timelines specified". He was complying with the terms on a slightly slower timeline, yet while progress was being made the US decided an attack was the better option.</i> </p>

<p>I may be misremembering, or I may have even swallowed some propaganda from a vast right wing conspiracy war machine or something, but my memory tells me that Hussein had made clear his contempt for the process and his intent to comply only as much as necessary to placate people, not to actually comply with the terms.  It wasn't like when you get behind on a loan payment and call the loan company to say, "Look, I'm very sorry I'm behind, but can we work this out?"  It was more like calling them up to say, "I'm behind, and I'm not going to cooperate with you, and I don't see an obligation to, and you can just accept whatever payments I choose to give you whenever I feel like.  If I do."  In other words, in addition to dragging his feet, Hussein was announcing his intention to not comply 100% in the future.</p>

<p> <i>Why? Do you not get a vote because you're a pacifist??? That makes no sense whatsoever.</i> </p>

<p>I recognize a right of all human beings to self-defense and I choose not to exercise mine for religious reasons, and I believe I've restrained from interfering with other people exercising theirs.  I believe all just war would have to be an extension of this right to self defense.  The exact terms under which exercising that right is valid is going to have to be between those who exercise it and those who are on the other end.  For my part, I'll never again vote for a politician who believes in using lethal government force, since I don't believe in doing it myself and can't authorize someone to do so as my representative.  But if other people think they are legitimately threatened and need to take action to defend themselves, that's for them to determine.</p>

UN weapons inspectors, the UN security council and the U.S. feel that this declaration fails to account for all of Iraq's chemical and biological agents (it was later proved that the declaration was in fact accurate, and the suspected missing weapons were missing because the US and UK had destroyed them in their earlier bombings).<br><br>January 27, 2003: Chairmen of the inspections effort report to the UN Security Council that, while Iraq has provided some access to facilities, concerns remain regarding undeclared material; inability to interview Iraqi scientists; inability to deploy aerial surveillance during inspections; and harassment of weapons inspectors.<br><br>February 5, 2003: At the United Nations US Secretary of State Colin Powell presents the US government's case against the Saddam Hussein government of Iraq, as part of the diplomatic side of the U.S. plan to invade Iraq. The presentation includes tape recordings, satellite photographs and other intelligence data, and aims to prove WMD production, evasion of weapons inspections and a link to Al-Qaida. This is the event that Colin Powell later stated that he owed the US an apology for, because it was misleading and in some cases entirely fabricated.<br><br>February 7, 2003: The chief United Nations arms inspector Hans Blix says Iraq appears to be making fresh efforts to cooperate with U.N. teams hunting weapons of mass destruction, while Washington says the "momentum is building" for war with Iraq.<br><br>February 12, 2003: An audio tape attributed to Osama bin Laden is released by al Jazeera television.

Iraq also destroys a launcher and five engines in a rush to prove it is disarming before a crucial U.N. report on March 7. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan calls the new actions "a positive development" while the White House remains unconvinced saying, "Despite whatever limited head-fakes Iraq has engaged in, they continue to fundamentally not disarm."<br><br>March 5, 2003: Two days before his scheduled update to the United Nations on Iraqi cooperation with inspection, Hans Blix credits Iraq with "a great deal more of cooperation now".

<p>Okay, here's what I thought happened: it was insisted to Iraq (by the UN, the US, and/or the inspectors) that immediate access be granted to certain sites.  Iraq said, "No, wait, hang on a minute, uh, we don't want to do that right now."  It was a situation that, if I remembered, could have been completely cleared up if Iraq had just said, "Come on in.  Today."  And they didn't.</p>

<p>And I see things in there like, "harassment of weapons inspectors," and I have to ask, "Isn't it clear that this is not cooperating with the terms?"  I see, "They state that the Iraqis have been co-operating well," and I want to know, "Is this like when your two-year old finally does one out of ten things you asked and you say, 'Good job,' or does this mean they were cooperating 100%?  Were they giving full compliance, or just surprising us by actually complying a little bit?"</p>

<p>And I see, "UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan calls the new actions 'a positive development' while the White House remains unconvinced saying, 'Despite whatever limited head-fakes Iraq has engaged in, they continue to fundamentally not disarm,'" and I ask, "Okay, which of these two opinions do we accept as an accurate appraisal of the situation?"  I don't take Kofi Annan's pronouncements as Gospel truth any more than you would take George Bush's.</p>

<p>"Hans Blix credits Iraq with 'a great deal more of cooperation now'": okay, but were they cooperating 100%?  I can't see indications even in Hans Blix's quotes where he felt that, "Okay, Iraq is now doing everything in their power.  They are cooperating fully.  They are not dragging their feet at all, nor denying us access to anywhere.  We have free reign to inspect anything and everthing anywhere in the country."</p>

<p> <i>Damn straight it was - I don't see how you can read the above and think it wasn't.</i> </p>

<p>My reasoning above still makes me think it's rational to question whether or not they were fully cooperating.  Sounds equally probable that they were destroying some minor missles hoping to stall for more time and make the world say, "Oh, look, yes, they are working with us now."  As long as there were still uninspected areas, the issue was letting in the inspectors, not proceeding with the weapons destruction.</p>

I agree, they were not fully cooperating, however the inspectors were (I imagine) dealing with some very deep seated hatred against the inspections from those who ran the sites Blix was trying to gain access to, so I'm sure he didn't expect it be a completely open door policy.<br><br>Regardless, the inspections and disarmament were moving forwards, even if not entirely within the bounds of the UN resolution (though it should be noted the UN wished to amend the resolution with new deadlines, but it was made clear to them that any such change would be vetoed). The US decided this wasn't good enough for them. This is why the US gets a bad rap for being a big bully on the international stage - they operated outside of the UN because they weren't getting to choose what was "good enough".<br><br>Regarding: <i>I don't take Kofi Annan's pronouncements as Gospel truth any more than you would take George Bush's.</i>, remember that Annan was merely reporting on what Blix was telling him.

That's the whole reason it was there, to say "we need you to finish on time, or else you fail, because any more time than that and we can't know you're being straight with us."<br><br>This is what the U.S. signed on to.  Maybe the rest of the UN didn't actually mean it, but the U.S. sure did.  And when the U.S. signed it, they also made perfectly clear that they were under no obligation to come back to the table if Iraq did not comply, and would feel free to act on their own if they felt it necessary.  There was never any doubt that any failure by Iraq would constitute, in the eyes of the U.S. and Britain, an actionable material breach of 1441.  And yet, Iraq not only failed, they completely failed, they failed miserably, by refusing to cooperate well past the deadline set.<br><br>If you are a parolee out from prison, and are wanted on a warrant for a crime, and I am a cop, and I track you down, and tell you to freeze, put your hands on your head<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... and instead you turn around and stick your hands in your pants pockets<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I am going to shoot you.<br><br>Remember, Iraq was not just any country: they were found guilty by the UN and under obligation by the UN Security Council to submit to 687 and following resolutions.  They do not get the benefit of the doubt; they have to prove their own innocence, as terms of their "parole," UN Security Council Resolution 687.<br><br>So in March, after Iraq's failure to comply, Bush said, "You've screwed up, and there's no more hope.  Give up now, or we're coming in."  That the UN never pressed the issue in 12 years just proves the UN cannot be trusted with such a task ever again.<br><br>Again, I am not saying that justifies war wrt the Just War Theory.  But it certainly does justify it legally, and the circumstances leading up to the war are not in the UN's or Iraq's favor.  They did everything wrong, and the U.S. did everything right.  Again, that doesn't mean the U.S. *was* right in invading.  Just that within the process, the U.S. was right.  Unequivocally.<br>

Without getting involved too much in the can of worms, and without offering an opinion either way, I seem to recall seeing figures on terrorist attacks (and yes, that has definition issues) that said while the total number of terrorist acts was up greatly since before the war, the number of attacks once you factor out those happening in Iraq were notably down on beforehand.<br><br>So at least for now I guess one could argue it's making those of us outside of Iraq somewhat safer.<br><br>And of course, my country hasn't had to pay a huge amount (or at least, their costs are only about 10% of our current budget surplus).<br><br>Which is a lot, but not THAT much more, and we can afford it, and nobody has been killed in enemy action yet.<br><br>So maybe we got off light...<br>

<p>You're clearly not putting that into the larger context of everything pudge has to say.  I think it's clear pudge doesn't sit around dismissing liberals because "it's just wishful thinking" or "they think we can all have a Star Trek like existence."  However, these are specific things that have been brought up to him.  The Star Trek question was brought up two or three episodes ago.</p>

<p>And all of this was in the context of, "Do you think conservatives are motivated by fear?  And do you think liberals are just motivated by wishful thinking?"  And his answer is basically, "I don't think either side is motivated by fear more than the other.  Look here, you could make the same charge about liberals (lists examples), but really that's not very useful for addressing the issues either way.  Are liberals motivated by wishful thinking?  Well, sometimes, I guess, but again dismissive labels aren't that useful for addressing the real issues."</p>

<p>To repeat the gist of my disagreement for those who don't want to wade into the other thread, here's a counter-example:</p>

<blockquote><div>Many conservatives are on a mad, hate-filled frenzy of xenophobia, willing to kill anyone who opposes America.  Their thinly veiled -- sometimes open -- racism is harming our country.  Liberals reject this viewpoint and accept that different people and cultures must learn to live together in peace.</div></blockquote>

<p>Of course, since I'm fuzzy on the word "many", that's also technically correct and if I posted that to my LiveJournal blog, there are probably quite a few folks out there who wouldn't see a problem with that statement, though it's so over the top I'm sure I'd be called on it.</p>

<p>Remember when Clinton said "I did not have sex with that woman"?  Because of how he defined "sex" and the fact that he may have been pointing at someone other the Monica Lewinsky, many people have pointed out that what Clinton said might not <em>technically</em> be untrue.  That's a far cry from making the statement honest.</p>

<p>Well, it's not too different over in the US.  The country's been dragged so far to the right that the Democrats are a right wing party and the Republicans somewhat further to the right.  There are a lot of commentators out there who refer to prominent Democrats as being left-wing radicals and people with no passports, who've never been to another country and who's views on world politics are carefully formed by Fox News nod their heads in agreement.  The US and both major potical parties are so far to the right -- both in terms of political and economic freedom -- that people are being presented with red and maroon as their wide spectrum of choice and many no longer realize it.  In fact, this has largely destroyed the Democratic party because they no longer know who they are and they're riding the anti-Republican sentiment right now.</p>

No, the Democrats are not at all on the right.  In fact, it's the Republicans who have been dragged far to the left, violating the Constitution to give pay for public schools and medicine and so on; using the language of progressivism ("it's good for society!") to support things like cutting the inheritance tax (which needs no such justification); and so on.<br><br>This country has never been as far to the left as it is right now.<br>

<p>I really have trouble seeing the evidence for that assertion.  I hear it a lot, but usually it just makes me think, "Ah, that person is so far skewed to the left he's confused."</p>

<p>I tell you this because I consider you to be the kind of rational person who could actually examine and back up this assertion, if possible.  When I start listing issues, and then look to see which side the Democratic Party is on, I get a list of "left<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... left<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... left."  I see a little bit of waffling around, and certainly there is a distinction between the quiet mainstream and the vocal radical.  But the Democratic Party looks pretty leftist to me.  I haven't seen them calling for smaller government on much at all, except for a few social issues.</p>

<p>And remember, I'm not exactly what you'd call right-wing; I'm libertarian/anarcho-capitalist.  I favor drug legalization and all that.  I'm just looking for issues where the Democratic Party isn't leftist, and I'm not seeing them.</p>

And wasn't it you in our last discussion who was disparaging wikipedia, apparently on the basis that the internet can say whatever it wants? btw, My guess is you will change the subject or not even revisit this.<br><br>And don't forget your farewell post in that previous exchange,<br><br>"You accomplished other things: e.g., you proved yourself to be someone whose post I won't read past the first few sentences of."<br><br>It is the only way you will leave me with the last word.

Ah, I see.  I was arguing with phillup in that discussion too, and he linked to the discussion which explained it (although in a slightly different context).  I took his posting of <a href="//use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=24809&amp;cid=37986" title="perl.org">that link</a perl.org> as the explanation.<br><br>There's history behind that discussion, which is why it is so short.  But considering I was responding to phillup, I at that point considered the complaint answered.  I now realize that was insufficient for you.<br><br>So to be clear: TorgoX was endorsing the quote, which directly referenced Bush by referring to "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership_society" title="wikipedia.org">ownership society</a wikipedia.org>," which is Bush's phrase.  And even though this had been going on for (acc. to the article) six years before Bush took office, it mentioned "current rates" which are greater since he took office.<br><br>So the combination of focusing on the current rate and blaming it on Bush's concept, "ownership society," and then TorgoX's explicit attack on the lack of "decent government in the US," is a pretty clear attack on Bush himself.<br>

To be clear: I take it that I do not have to humbly apologize and this topic does not show me  to be a time waster, because your argument is not there.  Apparently another arugment about another quote is somewhere else, however, and that might have been sufficient for me.

"THIS STRANGE TWENTIETH CENTURY<br><br>The worst of my asthma attack is over and I feel almost all right, though now and again I resort to my new acquisition, a French inhaler. It's extraordinary how much I miss Alberto. It's as if my flanks are unprotected from a hypothetical attack. I'm always turning round to tell him something and then I realize he's not there.<br><br>Well, there's not much to complain ahout: painstakingly well looked after, good food in ahundance and the expectation of going home to start my studies again and finally getting the degree which will enable me to practise. Yet the idea of saying goodbye definitively doesn't make me altogether happy; all those months we've been together through thick and thin and the habit of dreaming the same dreams in similar situations has made us even closer.<br><br>Turning all these ideas over in my head, I drift away from the centre of Caracas and walk towards the suburbs, where the houses are much wider apart. Caracas extends along a narrow valley which encloses it and limits it sideways, so that you can't go very far without having to climb the surrounding hills and there, with the dynamic city spread at your feet, you see a new feature of its heterogeneous make-up. The blacks, those magnificent examples of the African race who have conserved their racial purity by a lack of affinity with washing, have seen their patch invaded by a different kind of slave: the Portuguese. And the two ancient races now share a common experience, fraught with bickering and squabbling. Discrimination and poverty unite them in a daily battle for survival but their different attitudes to life separate them completely: the black is indolent and fanciful, he spends his money on frivolity and drink; the European comes from a tradition of working and saving which follows him to this corner of America and drives him to get ahead, even independently of his own individual aspirations.<br><br>This far up the hill concrete houses have totally given way to adobe huts. I peep into one. It is a room half separated by a partition with a fire and table on one side and on the other piles of straw which seem to serve as beds. Several bony cats and a mangy dog are playing with three naked black kids. Acrid smoke from the fire fills the room. The black mother, with frizzy hair and droopy breasts, is preparing the food, helped by a girl of about fifteen, who is fully dressed. We start chatting and after a while I ask if I can take a photo of them which they categorically refuse to accept unless I give it to them straight away. I try to explain that I have to develop it first, but no, they want it straight away or nothing doing. I eventually say yes, but now they're suspicious and won't co-operate. One of the kids scampers off to play with his friends while I carry on talking to the family. In the end, I stand at the door with my camera ready and pretend to snap anyone who sticks their head out. We fool around like this for a while until I see the little kid come nonchalantly back on a new bicycle; I get him in focus and press the button but the effect is disastrous. To avoid the photo, the kid swerves, falls off and bursts into tears. They all instantly stop being camera-shy and come rushing out hurling ahuse at me. I withdraw with some trepidation because they are great stone throwers, followed by the family's insults, amongst which is, the height of contempt: 'Portuguese.'<nobr> <wbr></nobr>..."<br><br>From "The Motorcycle Diaries" by Ernesto "Che" Guevara, translated by Ann Right, Verso, NY, 1995. scan and ocr, any mistakes are mine... mw487
