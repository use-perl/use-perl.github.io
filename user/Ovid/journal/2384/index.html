<p><p>Last night I played my first match in our 9-ball pool league.  I've never been much of a fan of 9-ball, but when points are tracked, instead of just "who sunk the 9?", it's a much more interesting game.</p>

<p>My opponent won the lag, so he got to break.  He didn't sink anything and I won the first game 7 to 2.  I broke the next game and sunk the nine.  Apparently, this is rare enough that I am getting a patch/award from the league for this "accomplishment".  At this point, I am up 9 to 2 (you get two points for sinking the 9).  We were playing to 31 each.  I started to get nervous and my game slipped.  I recovered, though, to win the match 31 to 22.  The downside, though, is that this will probably move me up a rank and I'll be playing against tougher oppenents.</p>

<p>It looks like we have a chance at getting a new programmer.  The person that we're considering is excellent and we already have a first project for him if he's hired.  It will be sooooo nice to have another competent Perl programmer here.  It's really tough being the resident "guru" (hah!) and having all responsibility fall on my shoulders.  I've done well, but I've also made some incredibly stupid mistakes at times.  I'm looking forward to having some help.</p></p>
