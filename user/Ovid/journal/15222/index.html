<p><p>Some of you may have noticed that I have been making fewer personal posts here.  This is an attempt to separate (a bit) my personal and professional lives.  My personal journal is at <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/publius_ovidius/">Live Journal</a>.</p>

<p>I have one friend of mine who sneers (literally) at any thought of an online journal, but I've found it to be an excellent way of keeping in touch with far too many friends, including those who are out of state -- or country.  If you've ever found yourself, like me, sending out a mass "I'm not dead" email to friends that you've not bothered to keep in touch with, maybe a journal's for you.  I've come to loathe email (spam has a lot to do with that), so it's an interesting alternative.  It's also a fascinating experiment in how the 'Net can potentially change how we view the world.</p>

<p>Also, if my Live Journal seems a bit sparse at times, it's because a number of my posts are "friends only".  This solves a problem I've had with posting information publically that I don't necessarily want everyone to read.  Of course, if it's on someone else's database, I should have no expectation of privacy, but I would never post the body's location to an online forum.</p></p>

Heh, all of my emails are like that now. Damn newspapers keep printing scary stories about us. (See this week's <a href="http://www.projo.com/" title="projo.com">Providence Journal</a projo.com>).

<p>I'm glad to know you're not dead, if not actually OK.  Keep well!</p>
