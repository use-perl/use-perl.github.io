<p><p>One of the definitions of irony is "incongruity between what might be expected and what actually occurs."  I suffered this last Friday.  I arrived at work, dressed in nice slacks and a dress shirt.  Our office manager saw me and laughed.  "Are you going for a job interview, Ovid?".</p>

<p>No.  I was all dressed up to see my grandmother.  I was to leave early from work so I could be at her bedside in the evening.  She was terribly ill.  I had not seen her for over a year.  As I pulled into my parking space, my phone rang.  It was my aunt telling me that my grandmother died early that morning.  I am the atheist in a casket:  all dressed up with nowhere to go.</p>

<p>My uncle, with whom I have not spoken in quite some time, met with me on Saturday and we agreed to have dinner later on in the next couple of weeks.  It's terrible that it takes something like this to bring family close together, but at least some good has come out of it.</p></p>

I had a similar thing happen once.  I came to work wearing a jacket and tie.  The president looked at me and asked "Who did?" and then he blanched as I answered without laughing "My great-aunt."
