<p><p>Question for my European friends: do you spell it "theater" or "theatre"? Our company insists that this is how Europeans spell it and we want a more "international" feel.</p></p>

I spell it "theatre", which is the correct way to spell it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>Theater vs. Theatre</h2>

To his dying day, my Southern Californian grandfather resented one of his elementary school teachers for failing him on a spelling test because he spelled it T H E A T R E, just like it was spelled on the sign in front of the building he walked by on the way to school every day.

<p>I don't live in Europe, but in New Zealand we'd spell it theatre.  I suspect the Australians might come down on the side of theater.</p>

<p>I'm intrigued by your use of the term 'Europeans'.  Is that some sort of euphimism for 'not American'?  The UK and Ireland are really the only(?) countries in Europe that primarily speak English, so most Europeans probably have a completely different word in their own language (although they may be derived from the same Latin/Greek root).</p>

Theatre here, which was Australia last time I looked: but give it another decade or so and "theater" will probably dominate, as will "color" et al.

<p>When I say "European", what I really mean is "our marketing people have some awfully silly ideas", but I was trying to be a bit diplomatic about it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<h2>Spelling</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/drhyde/">drhyde</a> on 2004-01-22T10:03:47</h3>
English: theatre
<p>German: Theater
</p><p>French: th&#233;&#226;tre
</p><p>Italian: teatro

</p><p>Which brand of European do you mean?</p>



<h2>surely you mean 'English'</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2004-01-26T09:37:01</h3>
English being the language spoken in England (and the rest of the United kingdom, along with Welsh, Gaelic and possibly Irish).
<p>
U.S. english is a just a dialect. If people want to be clear they should say 'U S English'.
</p><p>
Then there are those stupid dates - when will the U.S. use sensible date formats.

Right about the same time that us<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.ukians use sensible date formats too.  Representing dates as little-endian is not as stupid as middle-endian, but is still far from the ideal of big-endian dates.

<p>Big-endian dates avoid all confusion over what 03/04/2000 means, they sort trivially, and they are an ISO standard.</p>

<h2>Re:On date formats and endian-ness.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2004-01-28T09:33:07</h3>
but 03/04/2000 means 3rd of April, anything else is just plan wrong.
<p>
They will change the order of months or add Nikember or Bigmactober between november and december next.</p>
