<p><p>I like gvim.  Maybe emacs is better, maybe it's worse.  I don't know.  The simple fact is that I know vi, I find that I am more productive with this editor than with other editors that I have worked with, though I still confess to enjoying GUI treats.  For example, I like to be able to cut-n-paste large paragraphs by selecting them with a mouse.  The only gripe I've had with gvim on my Windows box is a long-standing bug where the contents of my clipboard would sometimes be inserted into the document.  I've been very happy to roll out development code with stuff like this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>$push @untainted =&gt; $value =~ /^($regex)$/;http://news.google.com/</tt></p>

<p>Where the heck did that URL come from? Crud like that would just spontaneously "appear" in my code.  A coworker saw this happen and noticed that I was using a wheel mouse.  It seems that I can press down on the wheel and it acts like a middle mouse button ... which just happens to paste code when using gvim.  Time to learn how to rebind my keys.  This problem has plauged me off and on for months.</p></p>

<h2>Mac OS X</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Theory/">Theory</a> on 2002-11-01T00:54:46</h3>
<p>That's a feature of Unix editors, actually. That's the way most XTerms work -- clicking the middle button pastes from your clipboard.</p>

<p>FWIW, the <a href="http://macvim.swdev.org/OSX/" title="swdev.org">carbonized version of Vim</a swdev.org> that runs on Mac OS X offers pretty much all the GUI goodness that you could want. Not that I'm very experienced with it, mind you. I'm an Emacs user.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
