<div class="span8">
<p>While many of us envy our European neighbors who flirt with socialism, little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland">Finland</a> can give us a lesson of the dangers of trying too hard to maintain a welfare state.  At the highest incomes, income taxes are a staggering 45%.  The government, trying to educate a formerly uneducated population, has made a university education free for Finnish citizens.  The <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/fi.html">CIA World Factbook entry on Finland</a> lists "N/A" for "percentage of Finns under the poverty line" due to large payouts to the unemployed.  And don't forget about their socialized health care, subsidized day care, extended paid maternity leave, generous pensions and many other payouts.<br/><br/>The list goes on an on about how much money the Finnish government has been spending.  And the price they pay for this?  The World Economic Forum, for the past four out of five years, has listed them as <a href="http://www.weforum.org/site/homepublic.nsf/Content/United+States+in+Second+Place+Behind+Finland+in+Global+Competitiveness+Report">the most competitive nation in the world</a> (the US comes in second place).  Of course, we know that you can't have a healthy economy and protect the environment, right?  Seems the Finns <a href="http://www.weforum.org/site/homepublic.nsf/Content/Finland+Ranks+Highest+in+Environmental+Index,+US+Lags">rank highest in the World Economic Forum's Environmental Index, too</a>.  The US comes in a dismal 51st place.<br/><br/>If you check the CIA World Factbook (linked above) you also find out they have a higher life expectancy than the USA, half the infant mortality rate and, to add insult to injury, the <a href="http://search.csmonitor.com/search_content/1026/p01s03-woeu.html">Christian Science Monitor</a> reports that Finland has been running a budget surplus for <em>ten years</em>.<br/><br/>After doing a bit of reading, one thing does stand out.  It seems the Finnish people are happy with their system and work hard to support it.  Here in the US, we worship the dollar and I'm sure there are plenty of nay-sayers who will happily explain why the Finnish model could never, ever work here.  Unfortunately, I think they would be right that the Finnish model can't work here.  You'd have to convince enough people to actually care enough about their fellow citizens to be willing to help them out and I don't think that's going to happen any time soon (because, you know, starving to death while unemployed builds character).  Plus, we have to spend enough money to kill the brown people, too.<br/><br/>Really, in reading up about Finland, it sounds too good to be true.  Anyone familiar with Finland able to provide a counterpoint?</p>

<h2>Proof that socialisim is doomed to failure</h2>

Thanks for warning us about these perils. I have emailed this to everyone I know so they can be aware of the danger.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>Then hopefully they'll read my counter-argument, too.  One primary tenet of economics (and one that's often not taught) is that in any given economic system, there tends to be an inverse correlation between efficiency and "fairness".  If you go too far to either extreme, the systems can break down.  One problem with many socialist countries is that they have strived so hard for "fairness" that they tend to be less efficient and economies like the US tend to dominate.  Witness the economic doldrums of France as a classic example.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, every country's social structure, culture and resources are suitably different that a "one size fits all" economic system can't apply.  The problem is that the laissez-faire zealots sometimes seize on this and loftily proclaim that isolated examples such as Finland are a fluke.  What often they fail to realize is that laissez-faire also can't be applied as a general rule and there's nothing wrong with trying to find out if we can be more compassionate and efficient at the same time.</p>

<p>I guess I'll have to step up to the plate on this one<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;--)</p>
<p>Not being an economist, I won't comment on figures and if the French economy is really that bad though. I will just give an example of why I can't really comment<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;--)</p>
<p>My favourite economic example is a perfect illustration  of a line that should be familiar to you: "There Is More Than One Way To Do It". See I used to work for Airbus, a German-French_English (with a smidgen of Spanish thrown in for good measure) conglommerate. They build planes. The French branch, which was state owned until recently, doesn't lay-off people. They don't even fire them. When I joined the company I was handed a leaflet from a union that asked for "stable jobs for us and our families",you would get a better chance to be hired if a member of your family was already working for the company. The business of selling plane is very cyclic, so there were years when finished planes would be stockpiled around the buildings, and people kept their jobs. Does it get more socialist than that? On the other side of the pond, their main competitor, Boeing, goes through phases where they lay-off 40 000 employees, only to hire back 50 000 a few tears later when the market picks-up again.</p>
<p>The 2 companies have had roughly 50% of the market for quite a few years now..</p>
<p>(Preemptively: I know about the state subsidies, both companies get some. I could also elaborate on what I think are the reasons for the similar performances of the 2 companies, but that is not the point here.)</p>

<h2>also a matter of culture differences</h2>

Quick note....<br><br>Speaking as a danish citizen. Notice quite a few scandinavian countries in the top 10 those charts.<br><br>Also note that the income tax are not flat, but progressive. <a href="http://www.worldwide-tax.com/finland/finland_tax.asp" title="worldwide-tax.com">http://www.worldwide-tax.com/finland/finland_tax.asp</a worldwide-tax.com><br><br>I believe that one of the reasons of the fine ranking, is trust. I don't expect to get cheated/lied to/murdered by fellow citizens/ politicians/the state (ok, politicians always twist the truth a bit). This makes it easier to create and innovate, and more likely to share.

<p>Yes, cultural differences are a huge problem.  On this side of the pond, we have a nasty habit of placing socialism on par with Satanism. I find that amusuing because most citizens of the good ol' USA are quick to condemn this economic system despite that fact that most of them don't know a damned thing about economics.</p>

I am not a citizen of Finland, but I have spent about a year there. This is realy great country, but<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>1. Finland receives big amount of support from EU (especially to support northearn teritories)<br>2. I have seen a lot (and I mean A LOT) of drunk people wandering all day through out the city. I suppose, that this country won't last in this condition to long, since prices of alcohol are decreasing and most Fins do like to drink.<br><br>But hey, at least now, they do make a great living.

Finland's receipts from the EU have been balanced by it's payments to the EU.  So no, it's not subsidised to any great degree.<br/><br/>And the country is set to become a net payer to the EU.<br/><br/>(sources: <a href="http://www2.helsinginsanomat.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20010521IE3" title="helsinginsanomat.fi">Helsingin</a helsinginsanomat.fi> <a href="http://www2.helsinginsanomat.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20040210IE7" title="helsinginsanomat.fi">Sanomat</a helsinginsanomat.fi>)

<h2>Wikipedia to the rescue</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/offerk/">offerk</a> on 2005-10-27T07:45:59</h3>
<p>While I have no personal knowledge of Finland, here are some fact and figures, courtesy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/" title="wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a wikipedia.org>:</p>
<ol>
<li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland" title="wikipedia.org">Finland</a wikipedia.org> has a population of only 5mil spread over 338,145 km&#178;, making it only the 162nd most densely populated country.</li>
<li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_Defence_Forces" title="wikipedia.org"> the Finish miliary</a wikipedia.org> expenditure for 98/99 was only 2% of the Finish GDP. Compare to the USA's 3.7% for that time frame, a number which has surerly risen since then.</li>
<li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Finland" title="wikipedia.org">92% of all Fins are, well, Finish</a wikipedia.org><nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br>(My point beeing that demographic homogeneity surely encourages trust and a greater sense of community and willingness to help their neighbors.)</li>
<li>Last but <strong>surely</strong> not least, WP mentions in an article about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Finland" title="wikipedia.org">the economy of Finland</a wikipedia.org> that "According to Transparency International, Finland has the lowest level of corruption in all the countries studied in their survey." <br>It is my personal belief that this is the single most contributing factor to the success of Finish economy (in spite of, not because of, their advanced welfare economy).</li>
</ol>
<p>Socialism has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticisms_of_Socialism" title="wikipedia.org">many opponents</a wikipedia.org>, I'll let their arguments speak for themselves. I agree that taken to extreme, any  ideology, including Capitalism, will do more harm then good. However I feel that Finland's welfare policy is too extreme and that it works only because of the several mitigating factors I listed above, as well as some others. As a case in point, Israel, the country I live in, had a similar, if much less advanced, welfare program until recently (recent governments have moved more to the Capitalistic end of the spectrum). However, Israel is almost the exact opposite of Finland in nearly every other point I listed, including, alas, corruption in the public sector. Needless to say, Israel does not enjoy the many positive points you listed for Finland (no poverty, competitive, etc.)</p>
<p>To sum things up, as you and others have said, one country's success in implementing a welfare state does not mean that all countries can and should use the exact same model. I'll add that Finland's success also does not mean that socialism is a successful ideology. To my eyes, Finland's success is in spite of, not because of, Socialism.</p>
<p>Oh, and of course, needless to say, Wikipedia rocks!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Point 3 is a load of crap.<br><br>Last time I checked, Australia has the highest rate of migrants of any country in the world, over 25% of the country wasn't born here, and it works just fine thank you.<br><br>One thing I will say though, is that we don't have any major minorities (except for the aboriginal situation sort of...). There's no equivalent to the entrenched poor black or latino populations America has to deal with. At least, not amoung the migrants.<br><br>But again, if you look at the top cluster of countries, Norway, Finland, Canada, Luxumbourg, Australia, they are all relatively small countries. With the exception of Lux, who can avoid economic tragedy of the commons and exploit situations, all 4 have large relatively large empty spaces. I'd say all 4 also have pretty low corruption. And things like a reliable living amount (albeit not comfortable) for the long term unemployed, and government medical health care.<br><br>So... small enough to avoid being "lumbering", large enough to avoid being incompetant (a problem when you get down near a million or two), and relatively strong natural resources.<br><br>But the demographic homogeneity bit is wrong.

</blockquote>
<p>I'm sure it does, but you can hardly say "Point 3 is crap" based on that - for one, thing, every point I listed is a <strong>contributing</strong> factor, changing just one may change the situation a bit, but the other factors will remain (as you yourself pointed out!).<br>
Furthermore, Australia is <strong>very</strong> different from both Finland and the USA, a difference that can more then offset the lack of a  homogeneous population. I'm talking about the fact that "<em>20.3 million people occupy a continent the size of the contiguous United States</em>" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Australia" title="wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a wikipedia.org>).<br>
Furthermore, according to WP Australia has been "<em>privatizing many government-owned services and public utilities</em>" and "<em>has attempted to reduce union power and involvement in the workplace</em>". Deregulation, privatization and decreasing union power are actions more consistent with a capitalistic ideology than a socialistic one. I think this more then offsets the lack of a homogeneous population. To summarize, I don't think point 3 is crap, nor do I think Australia is a good counter example, given the many other differences.</p>

<p>Thank you for shooting yourself in the foot for me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br>First you claim that point 3 is crap, then you hurriedly counter yourself by admitting that the counter example you gave is not really the same...</p>

<blockquote> <div><i>
At the highest incomes, income taxes are a staggering 45%.
</i></div> </blockquote>
<p>
As Frej pointed out, Finland's tax system is progressive, not flat, so this is a marginal rate.
</p>
<p>
Through the Kennedy Administration (IIRC), the US Marginal tax rate was about 60%.  It was somewhat high until the Reagan administration, when the tax code was cleaned up and replaced with a three(?)-step rate structure (with oodles of shelters).  That "high" tax rate was justified at the time because it was a 60% tax on all <i>income</i> above $1MM/year (back when $1MM was <i>really</i> a lot of money), the government needed money to fight the Red Menace, pay off the debts incurred fighting WWII, and fund the Marshall plan to rebuild Europe.
</p>
<p>
All told, high marginal tax rates aren't the most evil thing in <tt>+++ NO CARRIER</tt>
