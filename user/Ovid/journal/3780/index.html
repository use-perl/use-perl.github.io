<p><p>I will not be pushed, filed, stamped, indexed, briefed, debriefed, or numbered.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of <a href="http://www.netreach.net/user/sixofone/">The Prisoner</a> TV series (the greatest TV series of all time), you'll recognize the above quote.  It's from a short, 17 episode series that was first shown in the late 60s.  Though only 17 episodes were shot, it's a complete series.  The last two episodes "explain" the what was going on, but good luck finding two people who agreed on what happened.</p>

<p>I've started to pick them up and had two boxes of a 5 box set.  On Sunday, a friend of mine was at my house and she asked when I was going to get the rest.  I told her that I was going down that day to pick them up.</p>

<p>Naturally, I procrastinated, washed the dishes, did a little programming and then went to a movie.  When I finally got to the video store to plunk down $90, they were closed.  Grr... just my luck.</p>

<p>Shortly after I got home, a friend of mine called me out of the blue and said her bookstore (why are most of my friends female?) had a clearance on videos and, if I wanted, I could pick up "The Prisoner" boxed sets for 75% off.  I'm claiming the three that I need for only $21.</p>

<p>That has to be one of the most interesting, yet pleasant coincidences that I've had :)</p>

<p>Be seeing you...</p></p>

If you get the chance <a href="http://www.portmeirion-village.com/village/index.english.htm" title="portmeirion-village.com">The village</a portmeirion-village.com> is worth a visit. There's a small Prisoner shop in No6's house. I got a cool 'I will not be...' Tee shirt and 'You have just been poisoned' adorns the bottom of my beer glasses.
