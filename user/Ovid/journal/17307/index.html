<div class="span8">
<p><p>I have six distributions on the CPAN, yet I've never had a single test fail.  I could pat myself on the back, but I do wonder if this is because I didn't write enough tests, skipped corner cases, or in the case of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/ovid/AI-NeuralNet-Simple-0.02/">AI::NeuralNet::Simple</a>, I didn't know how to test it (and hence have only 18 tests).  A couple of days ago, I finally received a report of a test failure.  It was on AI::NeuralNet::Simple.  I wasn't surprised because the bulk of the code is written in C, so I naturally assumed that I was going to have some obvious error that a C neophyte like myself had overlooked.</p>

<p>Nope.  The module depends Inline::C and a couple of test modules.  Somewhere in the modules I use is a dependency on <tt>Sub::Uplevel</tt>.  I haven't tracked down who uses it yet, but I'm kind of bummed out that my perfect (cough) track record was ruined by someone else's module.  I don't want to put <tt>Sub::Uplevel</tt> in my <tt>Makefile.PL</tt>, so I'll have to get off my rear and find out who left it out of their dependencies.</p></p>

<h2>Test::Exception...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/LTjake/">LTjake</a> on 2004-02-09T18:12:04</h3>
<p>Ovid, that test was reported from my system. Sorry =D</p>
<p>A similar failure was reported from testing Test::Class (<a href="http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/121188" title="perl.org">source</a perl.org>).</p>
<p>Adrian, the author of Test::Class, suggested that my installation of Test::Exception was hosed, thus making Sub::Uplevel barf. After re-installing Test::Exception his distribution passed (<a href="http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/121695" title="perl.org">source</a perl.org>).</p>
<p>I will try yours again tonight and see if it passes.</p>

<p>What curious timing.  I was just about to post my research into this.  I just decided to look into this and saw that Sub::Uplevel was coming from Test::Exception, but it's listed in the Makefile.PL.  Test::Exception might be hosed, but it may just be a simple case of reinstalling Sub::Uplevel.  Clearly you do have Test::Exception installed, otherwise the Sub::Uplevel call wouldn't have been made (though a clean install wouldn't hurt).</p>

<p>And no worries.  It was bound to happen sooner or later<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
