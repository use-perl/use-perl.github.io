<div class="span8">
<p><p>Being forced to work from home since I have a back injury, I've found that I cannot work on any projects that require access to certain internal URLs or that require meeting with other developers/customers.  As a result, I've started refactoring one of the ugliest parts of our system.  Our "builders" which turn our DBIC objects into XML have been a mess of ugly, procedural code.  As a result, trying to allow alternate XML, YAML or JSON formats has been virtually impossible.</p>

<p>Today, while I was separating the data gathering from the serialization, our subversion server went down.  The person who maintains that system has just left the BBC, leaving us in a bit of a bind.  Fortunately, it doesn't affect me too badly:</p>

<pre>git init</pre>

<p>I wouldn't dream of working without source control and while it will be annoying to reimport these individual git commits to subversion, at least I can continue working without worrying that it's difficult to revert to a previous working version of my code.</p>

<p>Oh, and our new builders are built on top of Moose.  It's made many hard problems much easier to solve.  And our serialization formats are Moose::Roles.  It's made the problem very, very trivial.  Adding a new format now only takes a couple of minutes.  Before, it was a couple of years of dreaming that we could do it.</p></p>

<h2>DVCS under the radar</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/revdiablo/">revdiablo</a> on 2009-05-07T19:32:46</h3>
<p>This is one of the things I really like about the current crop of DVCS. You can create your own repo so easily, and so quietly, that it turns into a "do it and move along" operation. Running a local Subverion repo is close, but not quite as good (especially since setting up a local DVCS is not as permanent a decision).</p><p>I recently did this for our big product at work. The official system is Source Safe, which is hard for me to like very much. I checked all the code into a private Mercurial repo, which I use for local commits, and tracking changes from other developers. It's lovely!</p>

<p>People <em>still</em> use Source Safe?  Even Microsoft doesn't use it and they developed it.  I've used Source Safe in the past and all I can say is "never again".</p>

<p>Yeah, it's pretty awful. I've been making a more official push for something better, but my requests are being ignored or redirected. In the meantime, my private Mercurial repo gives me a safety net and helps me sleep a little sounder.</p>

<p>And damnit, I'm right in the L5/S1 pocket myself. It's been toast now for 4 weeks, ever since I helped a 4 people move an organ out of a church.</p><p>I'm due for a consult and a scan next month.<br>On the plus side, I plan on getting some nice work done once I can stand/sit again after physical therapy...before I have to go back to work....assuming I have to have surgery.</p><p>Then again, EVE Online could steal my soul.</p>
