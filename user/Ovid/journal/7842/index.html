<p>Murphy was alive and well for last night's Portland Perl Mongers meeting.  Brian Ingerson had a stomach flu and was unable to make a presentation.  Randal Schwartz graciously volunteered to do an impromptu presentation, but was called out of town at the last minute.  I had 25 hours to come up with an alternative.  I pulled out an old article that I had been working on and started writing a Power Point presentation from it.  In a little over an hour, I had a 35 slide presentation and taught myself Power Point at the same time.  The presentation had plenty of typos and was definitely aimed at new programmers.  I covered such in-depth topics (just kidding) as why we use strict, problems with global variables, subroutines as black boxes, etc.</p>

<p>Yesterday, three of our employees came back from a trade show with the laptop, projector, and screen that we needed for the presentation.</p>

<p>Uh, not exactly.  One hour before the social meeting, I discovered that the laptop had been stolen at the trade show.  I had to tear down one of our computers and set it up in the presentation area.  Then I grabbed the projector and started hooking it up.  Hmm, I wonder where the serial cable connecting the projector to the computer is?</p>

<p>I talked to Duane, the owner of the company and he said it was probably still in one of the trade show crates.  After we quickly opened and searched eight of the crates, Duane looked at me and said "actually, I believe that cable was in the bag with the stolen laptop."</p>

<p>I ran like mad to an office supply store and bought a new cable, ran back to the office and discovered that I bought the wrong cable.  I wound up offering the presentation on a 20" monitor.</p>

Similar things have happened to me before. The following are obvious, but useful:<br> <br>Rule 1 of presenting with technology is "get your hands on the equipment early, check it all works, and then stash it under your desk".<br> <br>Rule 2 is "make sure the presentation room has a screen, enough power outlets in the right place, working LAN points, etc".<br> <br>Rule 3 is "find out what buttons you need to press to make the projector show what the laptop shows and go in and out of standby - and write them down somewhere".<br> <br>Something else will probably go wrong, but at least some of the bases are covered.
