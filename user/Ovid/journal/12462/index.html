<blockquote> THE US has floated plans to turn Guantanamo Bay into a death camp, with its own death row and execution chamber.<br>
<br>
Prisoners would be tried, convicted and executed without leaving its boundaries, without a jury and without right of appeal, The Mail on Sunday newspaper reported yesterday.</blockquote></p>

It's probably just an inane scare tactic.  Yet another permutation of the all-encompassing Good Cop Bad Cop act.

There may well be an element of that, but more importantly (I think) is this: to the current US administration, it's simply logical--if it's OK to keep people prisoner secretly and indefinitely, greatly limit their access to counsel, and try them secretly with a low standard of guilt and no meaningful appeals (and they believe this is so), and if some are charged with capital crimes, then it's OK to execute those found guilty of capital crimes and why bother moving the executions to one of the 50 states?
</p>

<p>
This is not madness, and it doesn't sound like mere threats.  This is abhorrent and illegal, and those of us with a vote in the US had goddamn better do something about it.  Starting with me, of course.  Too bad fuming about it doesn't actually do any good.
