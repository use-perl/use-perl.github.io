<p><p>I have most of the work fleshed out for the world, things and rooms.  However, I've found that I must have a lexicon representing parts of speech.  The problem arose when I was considering how to describe paths from room to room.  I don't want to force people to only be able to use north, south, east, west, up and down.  If someone wants to add "northeast", who am I to tell them no?  Arbitrary constraints are annoying.  The problem arises if someone adds the direction "northaest".  They probably didn't mean that.  By requiring the programmer to specify a lexicon, we can check that the word exists in the lexicon and throw an exception if they try to add something for which no word exists.</p>

<p>Each word can optionally have synonyms and no synonym may be duplicated for a given part of speech.  However, words may be duplicated if they are different parts of speech.  For example, if I have the word "carry", "bear" might be an acceptable synonym.  However, "bear" can also be a creature you might encounter.  Fortunately, well-designed grammars can allow for such potential ambiguity and I think I'll shoot for that.</p>

<p>One benefit of this is that I can allow programmers the ability to write words in any language.  When the grammar is added, he or she will be able to provide a grammar for a given language and have a natural language interface in the chosen language.</p>

<p>One tiny drawback is how I currently have all messages hardcoded in one language (English).  Since all exceptions are being funneled through a <tt>_croak</tt> method, I have one convenient place to allow localizations (a little trick I've learned from Bricolage) and this will make this feature easier to add when I need it.  Perhaps I'll create a Pig Latin interface :).</p>

<p>One minor annoyance I've found is how the Room is a special type of Thing.  There are a couple of cases where a Thing has to handle things differently for Rooms but overriding the method in Room doesn't work because of the order of messages (if a Thing receives a message and a Room is part of that message, there's some odd behavior there).</p>

<p>For example, if I want to put something in something else, I have to make sure that both of those things are in the same location.  I can't put a ring inside of a box if the ring is in a different room:</P>

<pre>$box->put($ring);</pre>

<p>That fails if:</p>

<pre>$container->location ne $containee->location;</pre>

<p>However, the location of the room is the World, not the room itself.  Rather than have a thing have any knowledge of subclasses, I've found a more general rule:</p>

<pre>$container->location ne World->get_world
        && ( $container->location ne $containee->location )</pre>

<p>In short, if something is contained in the world itself, it's an all purpose container which can contain anything else.  I don't have to put special knowledge of rooms in the Thing class.  There have been a couple of times where it would be helpful if Things knew about Rooms (the other one has been a weird constructor problem) but I've always found that the framework has allowed me to find a general purpose rule around it.  However, I do wonder if I've set up my classes wrong.  Sometimes I would be simpler if a Thing was a subclass of Room, but a Room truly is a special type of Thing and the Room class has some special properties which Things should never have (paths to other rooms, for example).</p></p>
