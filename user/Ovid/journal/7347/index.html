<p><p><strong>Good:</strong>  Sending out <a href="http://www.heavensfantasy.com/hello/">this interesting link</a> to the office "off topic" list.</p>

<p><strong>Bad:</strong>  Not realizing that it was a page on a pr0n site.</p>

<p>Oops.</p>

<p>Had I scrolled down to the bottom of the page, I would have seen the pr0n image.  Had I not had pop-ups disabled, I would have seen the adult ads that show up when I left the site.  Had I simply bothered to visit the site home page ...</p>

<p>I still think it's a funny link, though, but that's because I'm a dork :)</p>

<p>In other news, I picked up a copy of the Pink Camel yesterday!  Best ten bucks I ever spent.  Ever wanted to know how to get your own copy of Perl via anonymous uucp?</p></p>

<p>I will always love the pink Camel, with Job and his CTBCPP setup.  I honestly think those illustrations did a better job of introducing someone new (perhaps even new to programming) than anything since.  (With all deference to those who have come since, and with the recognition that I don't read a lot of material anymore designed to introduce someone to Perl.)  Plus, it was my first look into the mind of Larry Wall.</p>

<p>Unfortunately our office's pink Camel disappeared with my first boss, who taught me Perl.  One day I will get another.</p>

I still have about a dozen from the first printing sitting in my office storage area, for sentimental reasons.
<p>
Maybe some day I'll auction one of them off at a conference. {grin}

As to why the intro stuff disappeared from the Camel - Well, we put it into the Llama!</p>

<p>I always suspected that, but only recently acquired a Llama, and haven't had the time I need to go over it.  (Like I said, I don't have as much reason anymore to look at introductory material.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) )</p>

<p>At any rate, count me as voting for the Job and clay tablets illustrations as one of the best ever!</p>

<p>(Making a note to track merlyn's conference schedule closely...)</p>

Oh, yes please - If you could bring one to <a href="http://www.yapc.org/Europe/" title="yapc.org">YAPC::Europe 2002</a yapc.org> for that purpose, that'll be cool.<br> <br>
