<p><p>I cannot discuss the names involved, but a very offensive act was committed by someone against a friend of mine.  Apparently, someone on the 'Net decided to play a prank against a "randomly selected" person.  They found a victim on the 'Net about whom they could gather a relatively large amount of information.  Then, once they had profiled this individual, they created a fake party announcement on a Web-page containing her and her boyfriend's address.  The perpetrator then sent out email to many the victim's friends announcing the time, place, and theme of a party, using an anonymous Yahoo! address and linking back to the Web page.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the perpetrator picked the wrong victim.  She is the girlfriend of a ridiculously popular individual who has many computer-savvy friends.  Within 12 hours of posting the the party announcement, the perpetrator had a photo of his house emailed to him warning him that "he can run, but he cannot hide".</p>

<p>I just wish I could get full details of how they tracked him down.  The only part that I know is that the Web page included a picture of the victim that one person had on his low-traffic Web site and access logs were used to figure out where recent requests for this picture came from.  Apparently, his choice of victim wasn't quite as random as he claimed, but hopefully he's learned his lesson.  The perp confessed in a long email apology to a local mailing list, so it's nice to know that they tracked down the correct person.</p></p>
