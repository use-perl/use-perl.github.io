<p><p>The stuff coming out of the White House is getting more and more ridiculous every day.  Even our very docile and well-trained press corps couldn't keep quite about this one: Ari Fleischer was being pressed about White House deals where we were offering favors to Mexico and Colombia (guest worker programs and so forth) in exchange for their support for our invading Iraq.  After much fumbling of the question, Mr. Fleischer replied "You're saying that the leaders of other nations are buyable. And that is not an acceptable proposition."</p>

<p>This was too much for the reporters and they laughed him out of the briefing.</p>

<p>You can read about it at <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/02/20030225-9.html">the White House site</a> or, if you prefer to watch the fun (as I did), go to <a href="http://www.c-span.org/">C-Span</a> and click on the White
House Press Briefing (02/25/2003) link.  Go about 28 minutes into the video and start watching.</p>

<p>I have to admit that when I heard him say that, my jaw dropped and I was wondering how the heck he kept a straight face.  Hearing the press corps laughter reassured me that I wasn't the only one (thank goodness).</p></p>

Hmm...where have we heard that before...?</p>

Having just watched the video, it appeared to be <i>foreign</i> (perhaps Mexican?) reporters who were asking Ari the tough questions.

Yup, those kooky foreigners.  I find that the US press is in general not totally feckless, but nowhere as perseverant with their questions as other presses.  I guess the US press doesn't want to be seen as giving anyone a hard time.  It's a laudable goal, but at worst it just makes journalists into glorified stenographers.

<h2>Hold On</h2>

You're saying that providing "favors" to foreigners can get them to support war?  I'd have to agree that's unreasonable.<br> <br>Now, providing billions of dollars to Turkey, that I can understand.  But that seems to be on quite a different scale.
