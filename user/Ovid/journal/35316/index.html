<div class="span8">
<p><P><tt>AI::Perlog</tt> is an experimental replacement of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/AI-Prolog/">AI::Prolog</a> that I have on my hard drive.  I was thinking about it last night and realized that there are two things we really need for "logic" programming:  unification and a search algorithm (typically implemented as a depth-first backtracking algorithm).</p>

<p>I already have the unification working.  In <tt>AI::Prolog</tt>, you could only unify scalars or lists (I'm being very loose with terminology here).  I think that sucks, so my version also allows unification of hashes and regular expressions.  I also am thinking about code unification at some point, but not just yet.</p>

<p>Of course, this unification is recursive, so you can unify an array of hashes of hashes of arrays of hashes, if you want.</p>

<p>Now that this is working, I need to figure out the search algorithm.  My first pass is going probably be a naive backtracking algorithm.  Make it work, <em>then</em> make it fast.  However, in order to do this, I need to figure out a clean syntax for adding rules.  Right now, facts are like this:</p>

<pre>use AI::Perlog;
my $data = AI::Perlog->new( {
    predicates => [qw/loves gives/],
} );
$data->add_facts(
  [qw/ loves Ovid perl /],
  [qw/ loves hippies peace harmony /],         # variadic predicates
  [qw/ loves hippies /, [qw/peace harmony/] ], # arrays
  [qw/ loves john /, { 
    wife      => 'Mary', 
    boyfriend => 'Larry', # oops
  } ],                                         # hashes
  [qw/ loves Ovid Perl6 /],
  [qw/ loves Andy beer /],
  [qw/ gives W grief world /],
);
my @results = $data->query( 'loves', undef, qr/^(?i:perl)6?$/ );</pre>

<p>In other words, that will tell you everyone who loves some variant of Perl.</p>

<p>There are a few flaws with this interface (suggestions welcome!).  The first I need to fix is that <tt>undef</tt> in the query.  That needs to be a logic variable which is automatically bound.  That might look like this (borrowed from Luke Palmer's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Logic/">Logic</a> module):</p>

<pre>var my $who;
my $query = $data->query( 'loves', $who, qr/^(?i:perl)6?$/ );
while ( $query->() ) {
    print "$who\n";
}</pre>
</pre>


<p>Second, <tt>query</tt> needs to return a lazy iterator (perhaps with the above syntax).</p>

<p>Third, I need a clean syntax for rules.  For example, consider the following rule in Prolog:</p>

<pre>gives(tom, book, SOMEONE) :-
    person(SOMEONE),
    likes(tom, SOMEONE).</pre>

<p>That query says "tom will give a book to someone if that someone is a person and tom likes them."  How would I express that in a pure perl way that's clean and intuitive?  That's a bit of a challenge.  Regrettably, while I have the unification, I won't have the search algorithm until I figure out a clean interface.  That shouldn't be a problem, but I can't help but focus on this bit right now.</p>

<p>The major advantage of this module over <tt>AI::Prolog</tt> is that there's no secondary programming language to learn.  This means that you can just focus on the logic programming, but it also means that you're not limited by Prolog's constraints.</p>

<p>I also think that it needs to be written up front to return sets and not bags.  This will likely slow things down quite a bit, but returning bags isn't logically correct, while returning sets is.  Still, the implementation I have in mind has a fair amount of overhead and logic programming in Perl is slow enough as is.</p></p>
