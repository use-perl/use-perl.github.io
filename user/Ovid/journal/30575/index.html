<div class="span8">
<p><p>For some reason, folks seem to complain a lot about the test plan in vim because, as you know, it's <em>so much work</em> to switch 'no_plan' to a real plan.  Based on a couple of mappings that chromatic wrote, <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=566364">I wrote a plugin that toggles the test plan for you just by typing ',tp'</a> ('t'oggle 'p'lan).  Now I expect folks to complain because they still have to update the test count manually.</p></p>

<h3><a href="/user/cog/">cog</a> on 2006-08-09T11:44:17</h3>
Could your plugin perhaps count the number of calls to qw/isa_ok is isnt ok is_deeply etc/ and update the test count with that information?<br><br>Sure, compiling that list would be tedious, but each person could maintain their own.<br><br>Of course... I'm forgetting about tests inside cycles, so... hum...<br><br>Well, I just felt like complaining<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>Yeah, the problem is that this involves parsing Perl, a notoriously unreliable thing.  Otherwise, I'd be happy to.  Fortunately, I work with  a vim guru (smylers) and he's been helping me with the tricky bits.</p>

I am not complaining...just nudging you to post your plugin(s) to vim.org.

<p>I think I will, but now that I'm looking at it, I have a bunch more work to do on it.  I have some automatic pod generation and boilerplate routines that I could use to create a 'PerlDeveloper.vim' script that could incorporate a lot of nifty things to make vim a very easy choice for Perl.  However, can't do that at work<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

There is a "perl-support.vim" that adds a bunch of stuff for Perl programmers. Maybe you can collaborate to add your stuff to his?

<p>Unfortunately the code in there is positively awful. But maybe Ovid has a higher revulsion than me, or something.</p>

<p>Hey, that looks awesome (no surprise that someone interested in Prolog would have Lisp skills, I suppose).</p>

<p>I've been thinking about creating several vim tools specifically dedicated to making tests easier to write and maintain.  Would you be interested in converting them to eLisp?</p>

Sure, that's fine. What were you going to create? The only thing I really want to do is get *smart* autocompletion of identifiers. Right now all I have Emacs doing is noticing that fun\t might be short for things like function_name, function_fqfname, function_ref, etc. That is, anything \w+-like that it already has open somewhere. That's often good enough especially since I don't ever really write out whole variable names anymore but it'd be even nicer if it knew something about methods.<br><br>So what helpers do you think a person ought to have when writing tests?

<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2006-08-09T15:51:36</h3>
<p>There are a few features I'm thinking about.</p>

<ol>
  <li><nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>,tp</tt> Toggle plan</li>
  <li><nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>,tt</tt> Run test (even with Test::Class)</li>
  <li><nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>,tm</tt> Run Test::Class test method (requires a planned but unimplemented feature of Test::Class)</li>
  <li><nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>,gt</tt> and<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>,gm</tt>, "goto test" and "goto module", respectively.</li>
  <li>Other things I think up as I go along (I have vauge ideas)</li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously I have 1 and 2 working.  Number 3 requires a planned feature for Test::Class that lets you run a single test method.  I've submitted a patch, but it wasn't as clean as Adrian would have liked and was not incorporated (I'm disappointed, but agree).</p>

<p>I'd also like TogglePlan to work with Test::Class and that shouldn't be too hard, but I've not written the code for it yet.</p>

<p>The<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>,gt</tt> and<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>,gm</tt> functions are tough.  They require a bit of discipline on the part of developers in how they want to lay out their code so that one can find the appropriate test and/or implementation in a deterministic fashion.  If the user has a non-standard layout, it would require that they set some variables in their<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>.vimrc</tt> file to let <tt>PerlTests.vim</tt> know how to find things.  Also, while this is fairly easy for Test::Class, I think special comments would be necessary in modules and tests if just using regular Test::More style scripts.  I'm thinking something like this:</p> <blockquote> <div><tt>package Foo;<br> <br>#<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:test:t/foo.t:</tt></div> </blockquote> <p>And in the test:</p> <blockquote> <div><tt>#!/usr/bin/perl -T<br> <br>#<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:module:lib/Foo.pm</tt></div> </blockquote> <p>If that worked, you could easily pop back and forth between your test and its implementation with very little work.</p>

<p>For Test::Class, you would specify test package identifier (typically 'TEST' or 'Test') and whether it's prefix, postfix, or infix.  Here are the allowed styles:</p> <blockquote> <div><tt>Test::My::Dedicated::Customer; # prefix<br>My::Dedicated::Customer::Test; # postfix<br>My::Dedicated::Test::Customer; # infix</tt></div> </blockquote> <p>In your<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.vimrc, you would then set:</p> <blockquote> <div><tt>set pt_testpath='t/tests/'<br>set pt_libpath='lib/'<br>set pt_testpackage='TEST'<br>set pt_testfix='prefix'</tt></div> </blockquote> <p>There's a reason why 'infix' is there, but it's a long story dealing with a company I used to work for.  I doubt I'd actually include that.</p>

<p>Ooh, and along with the regular documentation, it would be nice to include something like Ian Langworth's <a href="http://langworth.com/downloads/perl_test_refcard.pdf" title="langworth.com">testing quick reference card</a langworth.com> information.  I'm unsure of the syntax, but if someone new to testing wants a quick refresher of how to use Test::More, they could type something like:</p> <blockquote><div><nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:quickref Test::More</tt></div> </blockquote> <p>And get short output like what's on the card.  Still, I don't like that syntax.</p>

If you collaborate with the already excellent "perl-support.vim" module author then you can include that PDF with the distro.
