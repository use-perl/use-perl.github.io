You often hear players thanking Jesus for their performance and/or victory after a game.  Funny, though, you never hear anyone *blame* Jesus.
<p>
<i>We would have won that game, until <b>Jesus</b> made me fumble!</i>

Ok, ok.  I stole that from a comedy routine.</p>

<h2>Covering a point spread?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2002-09-09T18:08:29</h3>
<p>Actually, I've always thought it was rather arrogant of athletes to claim that some greater power helped them out.  If they're correct, doesn't the other team think something along the lines of "what?  You mean God doesn't like <em>me</em>?"  Further, why the heck would some supreme being give a fig about a football or basketball game?  Is he trying to ensure that he's covered his spread or something?</p>

<p>Yeah, that's it.  God, Satan, Ahura Mazda, Shiva and other assorted deities are up their saying "Yeah, I'll give you three to one odds with 5 points.  But don't give me the same burnt out souls as last time.  One more Jerry Falwell follower and I'm going to open up a can of locusts on your ass!"</p>
