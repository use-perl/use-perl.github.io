<p><P>My PIR patch (now with tests) implementing the <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Ovid/journal/38261">.trim</a> method has been applied.  My first feature added to Perl6!  I'm quite happy this.  I was surprised to discover that it's much easier than I thought.  Once I remembered how to "think" assembly, PIR was much easier to write.</p>

<P>There are a few other issues with it which need clearing up, including extra methods for trimming the beginning and end of the string, but that will have to wait as I'm busy the next couple of days.  Well, that and the fact that no one seems to agree on the implementation.</p>

<p>Regrettably, my <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Ovid/journal/38268">Test.pm</a> improvements will also have to wait.  By making it more useful, I kept stumbling on various bugs in Rakudo.  Still, Rakudo's getting there and is further along than many people suspect.</p></p>

<tt>Ovid++<br><br>Keep up them coming<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Once i finish sharpening Padre's Perl6 plug-in, i will certainly improve Padre's PIR completion with snippets...etc.<br><br>Ahmad</tt>

<p>One day I'll get the tuits to figure out how to install it on OS X.  Right now I can't without struggle, so I don't even try.  That's been one of my biggest gripes about Perl in general.  Since it doesn't ship with a built in GUI framework, it's almost always painful to figure out which one to use and how to install it.  It probably <em>shouldn't</em> ship with a GUI framework, but better options than what we currently have would be welcome.  I never did get Apple's wxPerl working with Padre.</p>
