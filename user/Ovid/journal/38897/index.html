<div class="span8">
<p><P>I've an alpha of <a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-Role-Strict/">MooseX::Role::Strict</a> on the CPAN.  The lastest versions will be on <a href="http://github.com/Ovid/MooseX--Role--Strict/tree/master">github</a>.  It also includes a patch from Sartak which covers up an embarrassing bit of code I wrote :)</p>

<p>Basically, this is a drop-in replacement for roles, but with compilation time failure if a class tries to override a method you haven't excluded from a role:</p>

<pre>{
    package My::Role;
    use MooseX::Role::Strict;
    sub conflict {}
}
{
    package My::Class;
    use Moose;
    with 'My::Role';
    sub conflict {}
}
# error message:
# The class My::Class has implicitly overridden the method (conflict) from role My::Role ...</pre>

<p>This doesn't meet the needs of those who merely want the interface from roles and not the implementation, though.  Thus, I've <a href="http://github.com/Ovid/moose/tree/master">forked Moose to provide 'includes':</p>

<pre>package My::Class;
use Moose;
with 'Some::Role' => { includes => [qw/foo bar baz/] };</pre>

<p>Any method not in the 'includes' list is excluded and added to 'requires' to ensure the proper behavior of an interface.  There are, however, a number of unanswered questions with this approach and I've asked the Moose list about them.  Not sure if or when this will be accepted.</p>

<p>As a side effect of the 'includes' work, here's how to turn an entire role into an interface:</p>

<pre>package My::Class;
use Moose;
with 'Some::Role' => { includes => [] };</pre>

<P>However, this will probably be an error in the future as there are concerns that having the absence of information being meaningful might be problematic.  I haven't yet figured out a better syntax, though.</P></p>

<h2>What. The. Fuck.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mst/">mst</a> on 2009-04-30T18:34:35</h3>
<p>This is<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... already a solved problem. <a href="http://sartak.blogspot.com/2009/04/new-moose-warning-and-new-moose-critic.html" title="blogspot.com">Sartak's plan outlined here</a blogspot.com> allows you to basically lint the code to catch this sort of thing, without running into the huge problem you've just caused of LETTING A RANDOM ROLE SUDDENLY FUCK OVER YOUR CLASS.</p><p>I mean, a MetaRole type thing that made it an error on a class by class basis would be great. What you've just done is randomly added compile time errors at a distance, without warning. I can see this as being perhaps acceptable for internal codebases, but I'd strongly ask you to make it clear that this should <b>not</b> be used in roles that you intend to ship to CPAN since they enforce policy on the consumer - and unexpected exceptions just because a module's author disagrees with the module's user about semantics really just aren't in the spirit of perl.</p>

<blockquote><div><p> <em>I mean, a MetaRole type thing that made it an error on a class by class basis would be great.</em></p></div> </blockquote><p>That seems like the best option.  Only at the point of role composition does a maintainer know enough about the use of the role to understand what's appropriate and what's not.</p><blockquote><div><p><nobr> <wbr></nobr><em>... unexpected exceptions just because a module's author disagrees with the module's user about semantics really just aren't in the spirit of perl.</em></p></div> </blockquote><p>Or roles, which exist to <em>decouple</em> the declaration of semantics from the mechanisms of implementing those semantics.</p>
