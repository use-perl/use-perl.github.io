<p><p>I don't get it.  I just don't get it.  A nightclub was featuring a couple of bands whose members openly support White Supremacy.  A local mailing pretty much blasted me and another guy for suggesting that we shouldn't support these bands.  They argue:  "who cares?  The music's good and non-political".  I called the nightclub and they told me that they cancelled the band once they found out what kind of bands were performing and now some of the list members are pissed off because they don't get to see their skinheads.  Most of the people on the list are pretty cool, but I was surprised at how strongly people were willing to pay money to support racist bands (mind you, I feel they have every right to be heard, but I'm morally opposed to supporting them).</p>
