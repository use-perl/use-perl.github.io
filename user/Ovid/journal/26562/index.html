<p><p>Does anyone know of any automated software testing tool which can verify that CSS is doing what it should?  The closest thing I can think of is to try and write some hooks into Firefox, but that hardly seems like a reasonable way to go -- and it's certainly not portable (assuming it's possible).</p>

<p>Part of the reason this came up is my XSLT can tranform the first letter of a word to upper case, but this is better done in CSS.  However, if I move it there, there's no way to test if it breaks at a later date.</p></p>

<p>
I'm not convinced this <i>is</i> better done in CSS.  Correct capitalisation of words sounds pretty important to me, and given the wide range of browers and CSS support that exists, I wouldn't trust CSS to do it reliably in all circumstances.
</p> <p>
I believe that on a very fundamental level any website should be comprehensible even with CSS turned off.  This supports the various non-graphical browsers (lynx, w3m, speech and braille), and is friendly to the diverse range of bots and spiders we see today.  There's a whole lot of scope for your site to be seen with incorrect capitalisation, simply because there are many browsers where CSS is not (or poorly) supported.
</p> <p>
As to your question, no, I don't know of any automated tools.  I too would dearly love not to check our website in no less than eleven different browsers to ensure it looks good in all of them.

<h2>XSLT</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/baz/">baz</a> on 2005-09-02T09:28:23</h3>
Not all clients will support the CSS method.<br/><br/>Do it server-side.



<h2>Hixie's Work</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Smylers/">Smylers</a> on 2005-09-02T12:07:18</h3>
<p>Ian Hixie, of <cite>Opera</cite> (and <cite>Mozilla</cite>) has done lots of work with testing CSS &mdash; mainly from the point of view of determining how well browsers support CSS, but it might be possible to use something similar for verifying that you haven't broken your style-sheets.</p>

<p>I believe the general idea for regression testing is to make a browser render a page, wait 10&nbsp;seconds, take a screenshot, and then check it is identical to one you prepared earlier.</p>

<p>I've only read about this, I haven't tried doing it, so I can't offer any more help, but this log entry may be a start.</p>
