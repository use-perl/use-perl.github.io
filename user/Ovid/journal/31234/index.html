<div class="span8">
<p><p>One of the things SmallTalk proponents like to brag about his how they can change their source code while it's running.  That's pretty cool and I want it for Perl.  As a follow-up to yesterday's post on <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Ovid/journal/31228">better exception handling</a>, imagine the following scenario.</p>

<p>Your batch process takes four hours to run.  Three hours into the run, it throws an exception.  An email is sent to the ops team who call you.  You log in from home to discover that the program <stron>has not terminated</strong>.  Instead, it's put you in an interactive mode "FIXIT" mode.  After a bit of debugging, taking advantage of FIXIT's use of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PadWalker/">PadWalker</a> to examine other variables and even (shudder) change their values, you realize that the problem is in your <tt>Customer::frobnicate</tt> method.  It's forgotten an edge case that's easily handled.</p>

<p>So at your request, FIXIT <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Proc-InvokeEditor/">fires up an editor</a> with the appropriate source code and you make the necessary changes.  You save and are presented with a diff and the ability to reedit the code.  Once satisfied, FIXIT installs the subroutine or method and you can ask it to resume execution of the code, rather than starting your four hour run from the top.</p>

<p>Nothing in that scenario is particularly hard, but there are a lot of fiddly bits which wouldn't look quite right (and deparsed coderefs for the editor look just ugly, but they would work).</p>

<><strong>Update</strong>: In yesterday's post, both Joshua ben Jore and Salvador Fandi&ntilde;o both point to tools which can handle this (one being 5.9 specific).  If this can be done so trivially, why aren't more people using it?  I'm confused.</p></p>

Just like people never seeing OO or declarative solutions to problems if all they've ever used is FP.<br><br>If you've come from a background where you take source files, compile them, and get running code out the other side then making that mental leap of going in the other direction is hard.

<p>The potentially fatal flaw in the plan:</p> <blockquote> <div><tt>#!/usr/bin/perl -l<br> <br>use strict;<br>use warnings;<br> <br>a();<br>a();<br> <br>sub a {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; b();<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; print 'whoops!';<br>}<br> <br>sub b {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; no warnings 'redefine';<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; *a = sub {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b();<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print "hi there!";<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; };<br>}</tt></div> </blockquote> <p>This is obvious in retrospect.  I can't imagine this would be easy to get around.</p>

<h2>different niche, different style</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/educated_foo/">educated_foo</a> on 2006-10-06T11:57:25</h3>
Although I know there are people out there writing large, long-running apps in Perl, I think a lot Perl programs are simply not well-suited to this style of development.  For example, I do a lot of data munging and interpretation in Perl, i.e. small, separate transformations on large piles of text.  From within Emacs, I can interact with Perl through either an inferior shell or an interactive interpreter (via Sepia).  Even when I have both open, I usually find myself testing snippets in Sepia, but doing most actual work from the shell via scripts sharing code through modules.  I may just have blinders on, but this seems the most natural way to divide up tasks.
