Maybe something that covers neural nets, bayesian stuff, and AI.<br> <br>Maybe the cover would be a borg-ified camel?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>I haven't done much Perl programming since becoming a sysadmin but I still buy the books.

I'd like to see "Perl Enterprise Patterns" or something equally buzzword compliant lying on my desk.<br> <br>It would probably be an interesting read, but mostly I would just use it to subliminally fade the script/unreadable/toy/fringe aura Perl has in too many people's minds.

I'd like to see something along these lines, but specifically about managing Perl itself in the enterprise. I know there was a talk at OSCON about this a few years ago, and I've read the slides, but they didn't help me much. I think you had to be there.<br> <br>The book should cover how to maintain an enterprise version of perl, how to distribute it across an enterprise to multiple machines on multiple platforms. It should cover issues with upgrading, how to keep modules at correct versions, how often to upgrade modules, how often to upgrade Perl. Also, how to deal with new requests to add modules to the distribution when these modules may be unknown quantities. A QA distribution?<br> <br>I would think it would have a best practices section and a section talking about how some big companies actually do it.

I that case why don't you just print out a cover and put it around some boring Java book.

It doesn't have to be that way. Here are a couple of paragraphs from
my notes that I mentioned above:
</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>&nbsp; While it's certainly possible to write Perl that looks like<br>&nbsp; Java, you're probably using Perl because it affords a different<br>&nbsp; approach and a different philosophy to solving problems. Don't<br>&nbsp; consign that philosophy to the scrap heap just because the<br>&nbsp; problem is bigger.<br> <br>&nbsp; ---<br> <br>&nbsp; Be aware of the unique advantages that Perl brings. Many of the<br>&nbsp; strictures of other methodologies exist because it is so *hard*<br>&nbsp; to do anything with other languages. Taking a rigid, methodical<br>&nbsp; approach is the only way to ensure, or at least encourage,<br>&nbsp; timely, reliable results.&nbsp; Perl is different. In the time it<br>&nbsp; might take to perfect one particular version of a C++ program,<br>&nbsp; the Perl programmer can try ten different approaches, select<br>&nbsp; the best one, and move on.&nbsp; This is the form of TMTOWTDI that<br>&nbsp; we don't often celebrate -- that it can be used as a means to<br>&nbsp; finding the *best* way to do it.<br> <br>&nbsp; ---<br> <br>&nbsp; Perl programmers are rightly suspicious of this sort of guide.<br>&nbsp; Too often, it's an attempt to relegate programmers to<br>&nbsp; diagram-reading, spec-following drones -- just another set of<br>&nbsp; interchangeable parts.&nbsp; This guide will *not* be like that, and<br>&nbsp; should work to gently but firmly correct that line of thinking.</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>
Any "Perl for the Enterprise" book would have to take Perl's
philosophy and culture into account, or it would go absolutely
nowhere.

<p>
Funny you should mention this; Andy Lester and I were talking about
it just a couple of days ago.
</p>

<p>
We both want this book, for two main reasons:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
We want a quality guide we can hand our developers and say "Build
Perl applications this way."
</li>

<li>
We want to establish greater credibility for Perl with management, to show that
"enterprise applications" can and should be built with Perl.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
In case anyone's interested, here are <a href="http://tmtowtdi.com/perl_for_enterprise_and_team_development.txt" title="tmtowtdi.com">
some notes</a tmtowtdi.com> that I wrote along these lines quite a while back.

<p>Possibly one of the biggest problems I can see with a book like that is the average Perl developer.  For Java, I think you can really get away with having developers less skilled than many and still have a bit of safety.  Encapsulation, type-safety and checked exceptions are examples of constraints that simply don't exist naturally in Perl, but are the safety net for the Java programmer.  This also means that the Java programmer must weave that safety net rope-by-rope or he's not allowed to do his acrobatics.  This "one size fits all" approach is not always the best route.</p>

<p>Perl allows programmers to skip the safety-net weaving and go straight to the acrobatics, but this is dangerous.  It's so much easier and quicker to do most things in Perl (reading from files is a perfect example) that many developers don't understand the ramifications of what they're doing.  How many times have we looked at larger scale open-source Perl and seen people writing to files without a flocking a sentinal or or reaching straight into an object to get the data?  How many times do people call external resources without checking to see if those resources exist or the calls failed?  Perl programmers can get a lot more done, but I often see it done in a fragile, haphazard fashion.  You simply need a better class of Perl programmer to get enterprise programming done, but there are fewer of those programmers out there and many find it tough to evaluate the quality of a Perl programmer.</p>

<p>But perhaps that explains the need for the book<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Having actually seen "enterprise-class" Java, I label the parent post "-1, Unnecessary Community Self-Loathing".</p>

<p>Trust me, there are enough terrible <em>and</em> dedicated programmers in the world to jump through Java's hoops to produce absolutely hideous code.</p>
