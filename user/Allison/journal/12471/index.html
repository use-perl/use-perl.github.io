<p>I guess news of <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perl6es/">p6e</a> has been spreading, so it's probably safe to talk about it now.
<p>
This book had the weirdest schedule on the planet. In late November no-one (the authors or O'Reilly) had any idea this book would exist. I had a random idea and O'Reilly liked it. I started writing in January, Dan started writing in February, and in March we pulled Leo in to go Special Forces on the PIR and IMCC material. It was a bit like suddenly finding yourself 9 months pregnant. "What?! When did that happen?!"
<p>
It's been an awesome experience working with these guys. Dan was easy-going and fun to work with, as always. You know Leo can churn out 3500 words a day?  (You say, "Well of course he can, he's Ne...um, I mean...Leo." :)
<p>
My apologies to everyone on my reviewer list who didn't get to review it, especially the p6i folks (and it was a <i>long</i> list, so if you think you should have been on it, you probably were). In the end we had a little over a week to contact all the reviewers, get hard-copy to them, and get comments back, so our editor had to trim. We'll get most of you next year. ("How many reviewers can we have?") And yes, there will be a "next year". The material changes so quickly, neither we (the authors) or O'Reilly wanted to do it any other way.

<p>Is that something that the authors are doing or does it come out of the O'Reilly cut?</p>
