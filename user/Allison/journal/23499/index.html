<p>Actual conversation with a U.S. border official on entering the country:
<p>
<blockquote>
[Usual "where are you from" questions.]
<p>
<i>
Official: What's your field of expertise?
<p>
Allison: Computer programming.
<p>
O: Yeah? What language? Java, C++, Visual Basic...
<p>
A: Perl.
<p>
O: Really? 5.8?
<p>
A: Yeah, and Perl 6.
<p>
O: Perl 6. Wow! Brave soul. I haven't gotten past 5.8 yet.
<p>
A: Well, that's really all you need for now.
</i>
<p>
[Other usual questions.]
<p>
<i>
O: It's always a pleasure meeting a fellow Perl Monger.

<p>
It put a smile on my face, anyway. :)</p>

<h2>Border Patrol guards can be intersting people</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/n1vux/">n1vux</a> on 2005-03-04T19:13:25</h3>
Interesting that there still are interesting people doing INS now that they're part of DHS.

<p> M<i>any</i> years ago, Dad was a part-time INS Border crossing-guard. Back before INS folks were issued firearms, teachers needed summer &amp; weekend supplemental work. He was on such a small bridge (from Canada, other coast) that the one Customs guy and the one Immigration guy each did the other's basic screening questions on alternate lanes. So it was once fairly normal to find a History Major / English Lit instructor / Guidance Counselor doing INS part-time. But now that they've professionalized it, I didn't expect it.
</p><p>As a kid, I enjoyed dress-up in Dad's uniform hat. But Dad's blue denim Immigration/B.P. uniform shirts lasted decades; I wore one every weekend for years. They don't make 'em like that anymore.

<h2>They don't state a preference at Minneapolis</h2>

<p> <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/nicholas/journal/20042" title="perl.org">On the way to OSCON last year</a perl.org> the immigration person at Minneapolis knew about open source, but he didn't state a preference. How many airports have been infiltrated by open source users?</p>



<h2>Mongers in strange places</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dha/">dha</a> on 2005-03-05T06:51:23</h3>
Well, that's probably a better experience than brian's story about how, in the early ny.pm days, he was on the subway heading home, working on some code, and a homeless guy came up on him and looked at what he was doing and said "Hey, is that perl?"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
