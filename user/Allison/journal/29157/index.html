<div class="span8">
<p><p>Hey, why not? All the <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Alias/journal/29129">cool</a> <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/cog/journal/29130">kids</a> are doing it! :)

<p>I would like to announce my candidacy for the presidency of The Perl Foundation. My platform is as follows:

<ol>
<li> I will work long hours without pay or thanks.

<li> I will spend my personal income and vacation time to attend Perl conferences around the world.

<li> I will always be enthusiastic about new volunteers, no matter how many times I hear:

<blockquote><i>
"Hi, I'd like to volunteer."<br>
"Great! What would you like to do?"<br>
"I don't know."<br>
"How about X?"<br>
"I don't want to do *that*."
</i></blockquote>

<p>Or:

<blockquote><i>
"Hi, I'd like to volunteer to do Y."<br>
"Great!"</i> 1 month later: <i>"Hey, how's Y going?"<br>
&lt;silence&gt;
</i></blockquote>

<li> I will consistently have faith that I can determine the answer to the problems at hand, because that's my job. When one solution fails, I will try another, and another, and another. When a solution succeeds, I will not be disappointed that no one notices.

<li> I will always be aware that the title is just a title and holds no real value.

<li> I will face criticism kindly, and not take it personally. I will honestly assess my actions and the actions of other volunteers to look for ways we can improve. I will also accept that some improvements take time, and appreciate short-term progress towards larger improvements.

<li> I will always look for good ideas, but also remember that not all ideas are good ideas.

<li> I will hold on to my sense of humor and understand when a joke contains a serious truth and when a serious statement is a joke.

</ol>

<p>Thanks for listening, and I look forward to your support in the 2002 elections! ;)</p>

&gt; 4. I will always be enthusiastic about new volunteers, no<br>&gt; matter howmany times I hear:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    "Hi, I'd like to volunteer."<br>&gt;    "Great! What would you like to do?"<br>&gt;    "I don't know."<br>&gt;    "How about X?"<br>&gt;    "I don't want to do *that*."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Or:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    "Hi, I'd like to volunteer to do Y."<br>&gt;    "Great!" 1 month later: "Hey, how's Y going?"<br>&gt;    <br><br>Indeed. If I had a volunteer for every time I'd heard that...<br><br>Unfortunately, it seems a lot of the time that volunteers, when asking to help out and being presented with a Yak to shave, vanish into thin air.<br><br>Reducing barriers to entry seems to help. Audrey's approach of giving people commit bits by way of an answer has been very instructive (if somewhat chaotic)<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>And jobs for which people can gain both <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Alias/journal/28427" title="perl.org">notariety and beer</a perl.org> seem to be particularly attractive to volunteers.<br><br>And I thank you for the time you put in, especially from all of over here that will mostly never get the chance to meet you in person and say it.

&gt; Reducing barriers to entry seems to help.<br><br>What's seen as barriers? I'm not personally aware of, in the past 5ish years I've been working with TPF, that anyone volunteering to help has been turned away.<br><br>&gt; And jobs for which people can gain both notariety and beer seem to be particularly attractive to volunteers.<br><br>There is no notariety. Not even inter-TPF White Camels! And, for all TPF-related things I've done and people and I have helped with, I have yet to get a beer for it (I did get traditional gift for organizing/hosting a YAPC). Doing things for TPF is a thankless task, where you have to just be happy you're doing what you can for Perl and the community. If you expect more, you're setting yourself up for failure. I think what everyone has done within TPF has been completely altruistic, and that may sometimes be forgotten.<br>

&gt; What's seen as barriers? I'm not personally aware of, in the past 5ish years I've been working with TPF, that anyone volunteering to help has been turned away.<br><br>It's true that I'm working with examples from technical projects here, but for one small example I've seen a tripling or better of small patches actually being applied to code since moving from SourceForge CVS to email-account based SVN.<br><br>There's a couple of extra nigglies needed to get past the SourceForge permissions stuff, but even that was enough to see 2/3rds of potential contributors bail out early.<br><br>I've pushed for people emailing or IRCing me patches to shove them into RT instead, and given them direct links to the reporting page and cut and paste to.<br><br>This seems to result in better longer-term contribution levels, as down the line if someone else adds a note to that bug, there's a level of cross-fertilisation that occurs and I see some evidence that this creates more of a community and encourages the two to move forward more than they would have otherwise.<br><br>If you look at some other fairly thankless jobs, such as testing other people's modules, or writing a Windows installer, both of these have seen increased participation once extra attention was brought to them. (Phalynx and the "metre of beer" thing).<br><br>While these are technical examples, it does demonstrate that it is possible to take an unsexy area and make it more so, somehow. I get a sense that the answer is going to be different for each different case though, so I'm not sure how you might leverage this in the non-technical volunteering...<br><br>

<p><p>I tried to buy one for you on the boat at YAPC in Toronto, but then I couldn't find you (go figure--how can someone hide on a boat?). It was getting warm, so I think I gave it to Kurt.</p>

Volunteers almost never work out, and you can't use their enthusiasm with a programming project like Pugs to judge their enthusiasm for something really mundane like putting tax records online or setting up a blog they won't be able to post on.<br><br>Most of the work for TPF is really dull to most people. That's why there aren't too many people doing it.

That's my job.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I enjoy a certain amount of schadenfreude when I encourage people to volunteer for stuff around these parts as taking the shiny patina off kids like Alias is cheap entertainment. Notariety and beer *cackle* Sure, kid.

Not bitter. It was a great experience and I'm glad I did it. But plenty of room for humor.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
