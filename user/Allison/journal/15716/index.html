<p>Ah, my new 12" AlBook just arrived this morning. I'm busily configuring it the way I like it now. 
<p>
Step 1: install RAM upgrade.
<br>
Step 2: reformat the hard drive with UFS.
<br>
...
<br>
Step 7 or so: install Mozilla. &lt;happy sigh&gt; For some reason it wouldn't run under my Frankenstein setup booting off an external Firewire drive.
<p>
Now for a happy evening of puttering...</p>

<h2>UFS?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rooneg/">rooneg</a> on 2003-11-12T16:25:19</h3>
What has your experience with UFS and OS X been like?<br/><br/>I've got a few friends who are engineers at Apple, and all of them avoid it like the plague, both because it doesn't perform as well as HFS+ and because so few third party developers test their applications on a case sensitive filesystem.

I prefer it precisely because it is case sensitive and splits off resource forks. I do most of my work on *nix and want my Mac to act as much like them as possible.
<p>
I've been running UFS since OS 10 beta and haven't had any problems. Some apps don't support it, so I keep around an HFS+ partion for those.
</p><p>
I was tempted by journaling on HFS+. It's the first real innovation in HFS since about '98. I just wish Apple would support it on UFS.</p>

Unfortunately it seems that Apple is largely ignoring UFS, since their primary user base doesn't require it.  So those who are looking for a case sensitive filesystem will likely be stuck with the aging UFS implementation they have now for the forseeably future.

I agree, that's unfortunate.

You can do case sensitivity on HFS+ under Panther.  I would strongly recommend this.  The resource forks are not a big deal for most people, and now that you can do case sensitivity on HFS+, I see no reason for UFS at all.

I use mozilla/firebird myself, but that's because I work from a linux desktop. You don't like Safari? I get envious when I see my coworkers using Safari. And there seems to be a <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/11/Late2003Browsers" title="tbray.org">trend</a tbray.org> towards it.

I do like Safari better now that it has tabbed browsing, and the google search box at the top. I  miss running searches from the same text field as URLs. Not a big deal really, but it trips me up enough that I prefer mozilla. I wish Safari would display the urls of links somewhere as I roll-over them (I often browse in a GUI window, and then wget a tarball in a terminal window to one of my linux servers. It's nice to know if the "Download here" link I'm grabbing is the url to the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.tgz or just another html page that has a link to the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.tgz).
<p>
On the other side, I really wish mozilla would figure out dual monitors in OS X (it pops up search boxes, the little yellow help descriptions, the dropdown from the search/url text field, and new windows in the primary monitor, even when the browser window is on a secondary monitor).</p>

To get the "display the urls of links somewhere" go View -&gt; Status Bar (or hit Cmd-/).
