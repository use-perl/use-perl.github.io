<p><p>I can't give you actual numbers, but the overall market for Perl books has taken an unexpected turn for the better in the past few months in a significant way. Looking at the graphs, this is largely due to sales of <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perlbp/">Perl Best Practices</a>, <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/advperl2/">Advanced Perl Programming</a>, <a href="http://hop.perl.plover.com/">Higher Order Perl</a>, and <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perltestingadn/">Perl Testing: A Developer's Notebook</a>.</p>
<p>
How does this affect you? Well, higher book sales mean more attention for Perl at conferences and in the media, which trickles down to more attention in the tech world in general, which ultimately trickles down to more Perl jobs.</p>
<p>
So, to all of you who buy Perl books, thanks for helping me change the world one book at a time. :)</p></p>

All good books, and I highly recommend them. Oddly, they didn't contribute to the spike (though they are part of the ongoing Perl market).

Well I'd like to say a big hello from NZ but you must be busy on or holiday or something?  Read my submitted story and get rid of it if you can.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>Jamie Nicholson

Your thanks go double for people who actually bought <i>your</i> Perl book?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

LOL<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Nope. My book is insignificant in terms of market numbers.

I actually had all of the 4 titles you mentioned in my last order from Amazon, and AFAIK many of my fellow Perl Mongers are reading titles such as: 'High Order Perl' and 'Perl Best Practices' - looking at the Perl book releases over the last years, the readers might have been starving a bit?

There may have been a some latent demand. I also think it speaks to the quality of these books. It's sort of like movies--if they're bad, they get a big opening weekend and that's it. Good movies continue to make money over time because of word-of-mouth.

<p>This new batch of Perl books hit some great sweet spots on the demand side and did so with excellent books. In many cases, people are referring to them as "must haves," especially "Perl Best Practices."</p>
