<p>I had completely free day today. The first in about oh.... 9 months? Maybe more? I decided to do something fun.
<p>
I setup <a href="http://combust.develooper.com">Combust</a> with a (proxied) working test site for all the perl.org sites, converted my <a href="http://www.onyxneon.com">business site</a> to using Template::Toolkit with an Apache::Template handler (it was static html until now, under the principle of "do the simplest thing that could possibly work"), and compiled <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">subversion</a>.
<p>
What can I do now? Oh right, sleep...
<p>
Every day should be like this. :)</p>

<h2>Something Fun?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rooneg/">rooneg</a> on 2003-07-27T13:50:37</h3>
That has got to be the best definition of "Something Fun" I have ever heard.



<h2>I'm a big fan of TT/Apache::Template</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjohn/">jjohn</a> on 2003-07-28T12:47:38</h3>
<p>TT is a small templating language that's pretty straight-forward.  Someone without a perl background should be able to modify those pages without much difficulty.  The plugin system is simple, so that when you need the power of Perl, you can get it without a lot of pain.  In fact, typical OO-style perl modules can be used in TT without modification.
</p><p>I'm surprised that subversion has become so popular.  I think I'll wait a little longer before moving away from CVS.  I suspect subversion may a few frightening bugs lurking.  Debugging my own code is hard enough without having to think about the code-magement stuff.
</p><p>I'm glad to hear that someone you had some slack time and you hard did anything involving perl (save for combust and TT<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-).</p>

I certainly wouldn't put my clients' code on it yet, but it has too many cool features not to play with it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
