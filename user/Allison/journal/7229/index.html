<div class="span8">
<p>Last night I committed the POD versions of all the Apocalypses to cvs.perl.org. They're in the perl6 repository in /doc/design/apo (the Exegeses are soon to follow in /doc/design/exe). The original POD documents weren't maintained and many revisions have been made to the HTML. So, I've been on a little archaeological expedition. :)
<p>
Many thanks to <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/weblogs/author/129">Schuyler</a> for excavating the raw HTML from the depths of O'Reilly's CMS. And to <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/TorgoX/journal/">TorgoX</a> for Pod::HTML2Pod, which did all the grunt work.
<p>
Now for the real task, updating them to fit the current design. This'll take us a little longer.</p>

This is excellent. And I have created a spot on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/apo/" title="cpan.org">search</a cpan.org> so they can be viewed as HTML as you update them

Thanks, Graham. That's going to be amazingly handy.<br> <br>And it would be even better if the Exegeses and Synopses were also available there. In which case, maybe the spot ought to change from<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/apo to<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/perl6?

Sure thats not a problem. Robert intends to get these on dev.perl.org, but until then I can host them.<br> <br>I can easily add any POD. It would help if they were in CVS though.

I've added the Synopsis to CVS. I'll have the Exegeses up in the next few days.

The plan for CVS is to have<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/apo<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/exe and<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/syn. Since there will eventually be around 30 of each, it's nice to keep them separate.

<h3><a href="/user/Damian/">Damian</a> on 2002-08-22T17:17:51</h3>
Understood. And that makes sense.<br> <br>But I still think would also be nice to have a single search.cpan.org page that aggregates them all, as it's likely I'm going to want to refer back and forth between each apocalypse and its corresponding exegesis and synopsis.



<h2>Re:And back to HTML</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gbarr/">gbarr</a> on 2002-08-22T18:36:24</h3>
OK, I have moved it to<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/perl6. There will be links for all pods you add to CVS under design

Looks great. I'll probably start using that instead of dev.perl.org =)<br> <br>One minor thing (isn't there always one? =)): Would it be possible to have the apocalypse titles shown?<br> <br>Like on <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/apocalypse/" title="perl.org">this page.</a perl.org><br> <br>cheers,<br>

When all the details have been worked out, someone should <a href="/submit.pl" title="perl.org">submit this</a perl.org> to let more of the world know about it.
