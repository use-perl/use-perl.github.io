<p>I broke through the "jetlag barrier" last night -- slept a solid 8 hours. :) I'm finally coherent enough to make a few notes about the trip: two weeks, two countries, two conferences.
<p>
The first week was Zurich, for the <a href="http://perl6.ethz.ch">Perl 6 Mini::Conference</a> -- two days of public conference and 3 days of private design meetings. Many thanks to ETH and particularly to David Schweikert for arranging this conference. It was organized on an interesting premise: the fees of the public conference would cover the expenses of the design meetings and whatever remained (nothing to sneeze at) would go to The Perl Foundation. Conference-goers get the immediate benefit of previewing the changes to come and at the same time fund the development effort. We've already had a couple of people express interest in doing something similar in other cities. I hope it works out. The design meetings were quite productive and it was exciting to watch people catch the Perl 6 bug.
<p>
Then on to <a href="http://www.yapc.org/Europe/2002/">YAPC::EU</a> in Munich. Many good talks by many good speakers. I enjoyed catching up with friends from all over the world. Conferences seem to be the only time I get to see alot of people.
<p>
My favorite moment: walking around several monuments to King Ludwig I before the talks started one morning.
