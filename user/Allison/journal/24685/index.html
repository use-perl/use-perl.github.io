<div class="span8">
<p>I just watched the final episode of Enterprise. It was a dignified ending, and paid a fitting tribute to the best character in the series.
<p>
I strongly suspect this will be the final Star Trek series. People complain that the last two were dropping in quality (my housemate is one of the loudest complainers). Probably true. I've always found the-story-behind-the-story more compelling than set dressing, so I'm often blind to the surface if I see a deeper truth.
<p>
I've been watching Star Trek since I was 11 years old. I feel a bit like I've lost a dear old friend. One who taught me to believe that life can be better than it is. Who taught me that even though violence, horrors, and death fill the world, they're balanced by friendship, love, joy, and laughter. Who taught me to focus on the good.
<p>
<i>"Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable&mdash;if anything is excellent or praiseworthy&mdash;think about such things."</i>
<p>
To quote another old friend <i>"So long, and thanks for all the fish."</i></p>

<p>This is stunning.  A web site read by geeks and not one comment on this entry.  Shame! Shame!
</p> <p>I'm happy that ST is off the air.  I'm a big fan and I tired of watching the butchery to a once-beloved show.  So, let's let the Federation ferment for a couple of years.  New myths for a new year!  Mama needs her stories!</p>
<p>Oh, I nearly forgot: there is only one Captain of the Enterprise and his middle name is Tiberius.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>

I liked TNG.  Good stuff, picked up where Kirk left off very well.<br> <br>I love DS9.  Sisko is The Sisko.  A nice divergence from regular ST fare.  I got the seven seasons on DVD.<br> <br>Voyager was, to me, eh, but a lot of people I know liked it a lot.  I watched much of it, so I couldn't have hated it.<br> <br>Enterprise was teh suck.<br> <br>I don't think this will be the last ST series.  But I hope it is the last one for awhile.<br>

What I hope is that someone will come out with a new series. Completely new universe, completely new characters. Stargate Atlantis is interesting, but still based on an old familiar fictional universe. We need a new Babylon 5, Firefly, or Farscape. We lost Andromeda and Enterprise this year, and there just isn't much left to get me to bother watching TV.

I never liked Andromeda or Firefly.  Andromeda was just cheesy and Firefly<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I never did appreciate the Buffy-style humor in Whedon's work.  The others I liked quite a bit.  At least Atlantis kept things interesting by doing the Voyager thing and going to a new location with new villains (although I don't really *like* that galaxy or those villains<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but at least they tried).<br> <br>Battlestar Galactica is not new, but it is a compeltely new vision of something old, and is the best new scifi series since Farscape IMO.<br>

</i> </div> </blockquote><br/><br/>Objectively, I know that each Star Trek but the first is a pale comparison to the original. And the first is just an oddball knock-off of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050073/" title="imdb.com">Wagon Train</a imdb.com>. I remember laughing at how cheesy the original series was. And yet, I faithfully watched it (weekdays at 5pm, IIRC). There's some kind of lesson there about "objectivity".<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
