<p>Our house has guest laptop. It's an old 466MHz clamshell iBook and sits in the living room beside the couch so visitors can hop on our wireless network. (It also has its own slashdot account, BTW.) 
<p>
Last year the battery died. I never bothered replacing it, so it sits chained to its power adapter. Today it lost a power cord. As in, shooting sparks out a hole in the insulation where the wire broke. The annoying thing is, I can't find any way to buy just the AC cord for an old iBook adapter. It's a nonstandard connector. So, I get to buy an entire adapter just to get the cord. &lt;sigh&gt; Let's hear it for Apple! ;) (To give credit where it's due, they did switch to a standard connector in newer iBooks and PowerBooks.)
<p>
At some point you start to wonder if it's worth spending money to keep the old stuff hobbling along... okay, it's more of a nagging itch in the back of my mind... a mere echo, really. I mean, I'm still actively using the 25MHz 486, so a 466MHz G3 has lots of life left in 'er. :)</p>

I've got a whole adapter and and cord from an iMac/iBook in that series if you want it too since it's just collecting dust.

Foo. I already bought a no-brand replacement. That was a totally awesome offer from you both. Thanks!

Yes, those adapters sucked.  I went through a whole box of them while using the good ol' Pismo.  Sometimes Apple would replace them, but most of the time not - not even on warranty.  Suckers.  And here we are, still throwing money at them and buying stock.  Tsk tsk tsk.<br> <br>
