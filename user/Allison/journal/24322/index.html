<p>I have this bad habit of leaving my cell phone sitting in the car until the battery dies. Then I find it a week or two later with half a dozen important messages.
<p>
I wish they'd come up with a cell phone I can wear as a watch. No, wait, what am I saying... I don't even wear a watch (never could remember to put it on). Ok, how about a multi-phone plan? I can have one in the car, one in my room, one in my coat pocket, and one in my backpack. Not to mention, my laptop should pop up an alert when my phone rings. Actually, I suspect there may be enough technology lying around to make that last work, with <a href="http://www.asterisk.org/">Asterisk</a>, etc. Now for an infinite supply of time...</p>

At Vonage they have a neat feature so you can have an extra number ring at the same time as your Vonage VoIP phone.<br> <br>Of course it doesn't work well with a out-of-reach or dead cell phone as that will usually just kick you to voicemail.<br> <br>Some day though, in a future near you, they'll figure it out<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br> <br>

<blockquote> <div>...with half a dozen important messages.</div> </blockquote>
<p>Is the most important thing here the assumption people make that if they successfully leave a voicemail message, it will reach the recepient, and reach the recipient in a timely fashion? So if you're able to get notification that voicemail has been recorded, that's the most important battle won, as you then know that you need to find your phone.</p>
<p>I guess in an ideal geek world, the cellphone company would be able to e-mail you a attachment with the audio of the voicemail message, but I doubt that we live there yet.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-( Is the cellphone company able to send notificaions of voicemail waiting, and if so can it divert those to another phone number? If so, that phone number could be a VoIP number, and hey presto, your laptop would ring to tell you that it's time for a new game of hide and seek...</p>

Most (all?) of the VoIP providers can email you the voicemail as a WAV file.   The cell phone companies should be able to do that too.<br> <br>

I suspect just getting an email every time I get voice mail would be a huge improvement. It would at least remind me to charge my phone.
