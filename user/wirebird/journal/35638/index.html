<p>I had a couple of Wirebird posts come through from the web form for approval lacking any body text, so for debugging purposes I had it start dumping all the form variables on POSTs.  Alllllll of the POSTs.  Before validation (where most fail) or spamfiltering (where the rest fail) or approval (where email spam, but never comment, sometimes makes it).  Now, understand that as a mailing-list admin I've seen more email spam than any human ought to, so nothing should surprise me.  (Well, except for getting spam that's actually targeted at women. That's still so rare as to surprise me.)<br/><br/>It's only been logging for an hour or two, but... holy wow.  Comment spam has a *much* different skew than email spam.<br/><br/>All I can say is I had *no* idea there was a market for such amazingly... *specific* types of porn.

While I was writing that, I was pretty sure I remembered a webcomic addressing the subject, but couldn't quite place it. And somehow, I was pretty sure I didn't want try Googling for it.<br><br>So yeah, "corrolary to rule 34 of the Internet: if you doubt that porn of a particular type exists, look at some unfiltered comment spam." Or perhaps "even if you *can't* imagine it, someone else has, and there is porn of it."<br>
