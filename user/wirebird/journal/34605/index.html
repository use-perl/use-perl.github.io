Apparently it's no longer okay for women to enjoy traditionally-feminine things, and certainly not okay to admit that you believe that men are more likely than women to be geeks, even if you otherwise level the playing field, whatever the heck THAT's supposed to mean.<br />
<br />
Hi.  My name's Karen.  I'm a woman in IT/open source. And I wouldn't have known that was a problem til everybody told me it was.<br />
<br />
And OMGWFTBBQ!!1!! I'm also a craftblogger. I SEW TEDDY BEARS! I'm setting back women's lib (is it still called that?) by decades!<br />
<br />
Yyyyyyeah. Clearly I'm missing the seriousness of the issue(s).

I wish I could say something about this topic, but it always seems to come out as lame, wrong, misogynistic, or worse.

Oh hey, go for it. I'm apparently fairly misogynistic myself, merely for holding the outdated belief that very possibly men and women are not identical.<br><br>I like to think I'm smart enough not to confuse the general with the specific, though, and assume that because *most* women are not inclined to technical careers, *no* women should be inclined to technical careers (even though (egad, don't tell that snippy chick from the Times) I've retired from my technical career to become a stay-at-home-mom).<br><br>Bah.<br><br>

<p>Most people&#8217;s thinking is limited to the options &#8220;men are superior&#8221;, &#8220;women are superior&#8221; and &#8220;they are the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>Strangely, &#8220;different but equal&#8221; is rarely even considered &#8211; even though it&#8217;s the right answer. See also <a href="http://www.psy.fsu.edu/user/baumeistertice/goodaboutmen.htm" title="fsu.edu">Is There Anything Good About Men</a fsu.edu>.</p>
