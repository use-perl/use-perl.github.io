<p>I was waffling, what with the price of gas, and with the husband not going (especially if the husband's employer paid like last year, which makes my total expenses pretty much, um, lemme add it up: the conference registration fee)... and then the TiBook's keyboard decided numbers were unnecessary. (And actually, they almost are. But the symbols above the numbers... I can't get by without those.)<br/><br/>Add that to its intrasigence when it comes to connecting to networks, and... bah. That was the tipping point.<br/><br/>Le sigh. I kinda liked the Moose track.

You don't need a laptop in order to go to a conference. In fact, you might learn more<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

Yeah, I was thinking if I did go I'd definitely stay out of IRC...<br>

Chicago... not as much fun as hauling the family along (at almost-eight, the kiddo would have *so* much fun at MOSI), but that's impractical.<br><br>Sausages?  You mean hot dogs? We're close enough to actually have Chicago dogs here and there.<br><br>Wind... dude, this is Kansas. *Our* wind is non-metaphorical.<br><br>Perl... well, yeah, that's a given.<br><br>M&#248;&#248;se... yeah, M&#248;&#248;se does call to me. Is it me, or was there M&#248;&#248;se year-before-last (when I didn't come), no M&#248;&#248;se last year (when I did), and M&#248;&#248;se this year (when I'm not gonna come)?  People are gonna start asking why they never see Karen and M&#248;&#248;se in the same place at the same time.<br><br>Also, you left out beer. I'll have to get some money to some KC.pm guys so they can proxy some Boulevard.<br>
