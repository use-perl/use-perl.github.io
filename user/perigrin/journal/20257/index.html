<p>I've come back from OSCON (<a href="http://chris.prather.org/photos/oscon_2004/">pictures</a>) to start my last project for the year here at work. Half of it is mod_perl which is nice safe territory for me, the other half is a Java applet for the front end.

<p>It's been some time since I've done *anything* in java, and I haven't done anything this ambitious ever. Does anybody know a good reference for someone who totally grok's Perl's OO and Package mechanisims into the proper mindset that produces decent (for whatever value of decent) Java?

Good Day from the Twin Cities!<br> <br>
I've often found Bruce Eckel's "Thinking In Java:  The Definitive Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in the Language of the World-Wide Web" stuff to be closest in understanding to OO Perl.  I think that is because he started doing his "Thinking . .<nobr> <wbr></nobr>." series with C++!  The Third Edition (December, 2002) is available in paperback but as I recall he's got previous editions available on his <a href="http://www.bruceeckel.com/" title="bruceeckel.com">web site</a bruceeckel.com>.<br/><br/>I'm right in the middle of reviewing his "<a href="http://video.haas.berkeley.edu:24874/ramgen/media-services/Eckel6-25-04.rm" title="berkeley.edu">Java Issues &amp; Directions</a berkeley.edu>" (2 hours of streaming RealMedia)

The third edition is now available on his website, and has been installed on my Palm.<br> <br>I'll give it a look see, but the last thing I want now is yet another high level intro to OO. I've always groked OO, to the point where I find it hard to understand non OO code. And the beginning seemed to be more of the same.

Just pick up a copy of Java in a Nutshell. It's incredibly terse, but that's all you'll need.

Which one? I just bought two (Java in a Nutshell, and Foundation Classes in a Nutshell) to cover *just* my applets (one new, two inherited).<br> <br>Mostly I'm looking for something like Damian's OO Book, or Effective Perl. I'd like to figure out how to do things that are simple in Perl, even if they're not quite as simple in Java. Like dynmaically building objects in a method.
