<p><p>Something is not right with me right now.  When I crawled out of bed at 3:00 in the afternoon my throat was about the size of an apple.  I've gotten it down to the size of a hockey puck now, but I still feel like crap.  Ohh well, I'll stare at Apple's new dual ghz G4 and feel betrayed.   My dual 800mhz just isn't as kewl as it used to be.</p>

<p>Martin and I have been working on a set of tools for the FreeBSD ports collection.  Think portupgrade but kewler.  I just finished a bunch of the libary stuff, and I'm working on the shell interface right now.  Thank god for Term::Readline.   Next up I'm going to learn TK once and for all and make a nice X interface, or maybe martin can do that.... he's a glutten for punishment.</p>

<p>Mike Furh and I had agreed to work on Net::DNS together, so we decided to fix a few of the bigger bugs and release a 0.14 release, just to get it back up on CPAN.  I haven't heard from him in a month, I think I'm going to email him again and see if he has a problem with just moving Net::DNS to my CPAN account.  Then we can work on cleaning up the devel branch for a .20 release.</p></p>
