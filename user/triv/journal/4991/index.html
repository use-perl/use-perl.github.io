<p><p>I just saw it tonight, thoughts.</p>

Good:
<ul>
<li>The action in this movie was much much better.  The end was very strong.</li>
<li>Yoda fighting was very kewl.  It was almost so quick that is was a blur, but if you think about it that's how it <i>should</i> be.</li>
<li>The CG in this movie felt solid, this is much different from episode one.  In menace, I always felt like nothing was quite real.  You still felt that in places in AOTC, but not nearly as often or strongly.</li>
<li>John Williams did a much much better job with the music.  Phantom's music was a little weak,  none of the powerful horns or rising strings in the other Star Wars movies.  It's back to how it should be in this one.</li>
<li>Humor returns to Star Wars.  I loved Obi-wan in the bar especially</li>
</ul>

The Bad:
<ul>
<li>I saw AOTC on a really big screen, and I don't think the digital filming quite held up.  The darkness was jaggy and forced, while the contrast seem unnaturally high.  There was none of the rich beauty that a well shot fill like this should have.</li>
<li>The dialog is horrible.  Lucas needs to get someone else to write.</li>
<li>It still doesn't seem like a romantic struggle between good and evil, it seems like a political movie.</li>
<li>Anakin does not seem like a dark lord in the making, he seems like a pissed off teenager.  I really did not like his charactor</li>
<li>The jedi seem very powerless in their downfall.   It seems very forced, and not quite right.</li>
<li>The romance between Amadala and Anakin is just plain bad.  I don't know if it's directing, or writing, or acting (I doubt that).</li>
</ul>

<p>It was a vast improvement over Episode I.  Then again, that's not that hard to do.</p>

<p>7.5 out of 10.</p></p>
