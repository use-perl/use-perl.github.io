<p>Yesterday I was reading the letters page of the Jan/Feb 2005 issue of Oracle Magazine, and found the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I nominate Tim Bunce (<I>Oracle Magazine</I> Editors' Choice Awards 2004 Open Source Developer Of The Year) to receive the IT Humanitarian Of The Year Award or a Nobel prize.
<P>
I respect his unselfish contribution and his universal mind-set to help IT brains around the world, across all countries and continents.  Tim has helped lead lots of precious brain power in struggles and journeys to discover the new challenging territories that will eventually lead to the better quality of life ahead of us.

Dang, I half expect Tim to raise the dead, too.  I missed that little OS Dev of the year award, and would be interested in what was said about him in regards to it.
<P>
Then, that afternoon, I was talking to someone about the <A HREF="http://jobs.perl.org/job/1560">programmer positions I have open</A> and he said "That sounds cool, but I'm waiting to hear from Valueclick.  I'd love to work for Tim Bunce."
<P>
Such a popular guy!</p>

Tim amazes me with his generosity of time to the Class::DBI list.  Great to have someone so knowledgeable paying attention and contributing.

As a no one, who knows no one personally, wherever I go in perl land, it seems there he is with words of wisdom helping someone with something. That's a nice quality to have.
