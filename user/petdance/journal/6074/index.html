<p>I've posted 
<A HREF="http://www.petdance.com/perl/geek-culture/">my lightning talk from YAPC::NA 2002</A>.  It's a response to some of the pointless hostility I see going on the Perl community.
<P>
Yes, I know, things are better now than they have been in the past, but it still could use some help.</p>

<h2>Great talk</h2>

<p>Glad to see you posting here.  I read through your lightning talk and was immediately struck with a Perl Monkish desire to give you a <tt>++</tt><nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>One of the problems I see with the 'Net today is that it's so impersonal.  I see some things posted online that a person wouldn't dare to say in real life.  Rather than single anyone out, I have to confess that <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=21576" title="perlmonks.org">I've done the same thing</a perlmonks.org> and was taken to task by a couple of people who I hold in high esteem.  I'm now embarrassed by what I wrote, but I left it up there as a reminder to myself not to do that again.</p>

Thanks for the kind words.

Right.  We forget that there are other real people on the other end of our email, or web postings, or IRC chats.  By extension, too, I think we forget that once it's been typed, it's possible for anyone to read it, even if that's not our intent.</p>
