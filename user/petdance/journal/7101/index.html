<p><A HREF="http://www.parsley.org/">Mrs. Petdance</A> loves 
<A HREF="http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/tradingspaces/tradingspaces.html">"Trading Spaces"</A> on TLC.  She has a season pass on the TiVo for them.  She watches them, and discusses various decorating debacles with her mom and sisters.  It's a family-wide love affair.
<P>
Well, now, since we have the TiVo, she doesn't even watch the show.  She just goes for the money shot: Right to the end of the episode when the couples see the rooms.  No suspense, no buildup: Just hot vicarious decorating action.
<P>
In other TiVo news, the TiVo is always interesting in deciding what we might like to watch in addition to Austin City Limits, Teletubbies and The West Wing.  Today it decided to tape an hour of the Weather Channel.
<P>
And isn't it kinda funny how we still call it "taping"?</p>

Well, I'll still call 'em albums if they're indeed an album, in the sense of being an album of work, as opposed to an EP or something.

My wife is hooked on Trading Spaces as well. My favorite is when they will have day long marathons on Saturdays. And she'll usually watch them even if she's already seen it. Well, if she likes the designers anyway.
<p>
And speaking of designers, there are a couple I wouldn't mind working on my place. Frank in particular comes to mind. I once saw some freehand art he painted on a wall, and it was pretty darn amazing. And he's a good designeer too. None of this dark, crappy stuff some of the others do.

Oh wait, I'm being sucked in... The vacuum is too strong... Can't get away... HELP!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

To call it "recording," not "taping."  "Record" is a music industry term that still means "album" or somesuch.
