<p>I'm done maintaining 
<A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTML-Lint/">HTML::Lint</A>.  I'm switching to my new 
<A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTML-Tidy/">HTML::Tidy</A>, which is workable but not very well documented at this point.  It's just a wrapper around
<A HREF="http://tidy.sf.net/">tidylib</A>, but a configurable one.  It's aimed at automated testing.
<P>
So does anyone want to pick up HTML::Lint and run with it, carrying on a pure Perl solution to HTML validation?</p>

Andy,
<p>
I Can take this. I'd appreciate if you can take a little time and let me know what's involved in the maintenance of a CPAN module, as this would be my first module.

First, make sure that you're actually serving a need.  Do you really need the functionality of HTML::Lint that HTML::Tidy doesn't serve?

Good question. I looked at HTML::Tidy and it appears that it depends on libtidy. I am currently using HTML::Lint on my development system and a couple of others as well. Since it is pure-perl there was no need to install the library. But since they are all development boxes, it should be no problem installing HTML::Tidy (and libtidy) on them. So, on that respect, I can't say that I am serving a real or critical need.
<p>
Honestly speaking, I thought it would be a learning experience for me and this was at least one of the reasons for my offer.

Drop me an email and we can talk more there.  You'll need a PAUSE ID, too.
