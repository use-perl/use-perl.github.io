<p><p>Iain Truskett, or Spoon, will be sorely missed by the Perl
community.  He
<A href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/burninggirl/2003/12/31/">died on
December 29th, 2003</A> in his home in Canberra, Australia.
</p>

<p>Iain was a tireless contributor to Perl.  Along the way, he:
<ul>
    <li>
    <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/spoon/">Wrote 15 Perl modules</a><br>
    Iain especially loved to automate the web.</li>

    <li>Created and maintained the <A HREF="http://books.perl.org">Perl Books site</A>.</LI>

    <li>Contributed two hacks to 
    <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/spiderhks/"><CITE>Spidering Hacks</CITE></A>.</li>

    <li>Contributed <A HREF="http://dellah.org/perl/changes/">numerous patches to Perl</A>.</li>

    <li>Contributed many patches to my pet project, <A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-Mechanize">WWW::Mechanize</A><BR>
    If it weren't for Iain, I'd still have that bug with the <TT>back()</TT> method.</LI>

</ul>

<p>Even more importantly, Iain was a great colleague.  I never met
him, or even spoke to him except through email and IRC, but I feel
like he was a friend.  He was always willing to help out when
possible, and at least discuss an idea when not.</p>
<p>One night, we were in IRC helping someone with a testing problem.
The problem was solved with a module that the person didn't know existed.
I said "We should get together a 
<A HREF="http://qa.perl.org/test-modules.html">list of all the Perl testing modules</A>
and summarize what they do.  Would you be willing to help out?" A
couple of hours later, he'd taken care of A-M, where it took me
days to finish up N-Z.  Later, when I thanked him for jumping on
it so quickly, he confessed, "I was really just avoiding real
<NOBR>work.&nbsp;:-)"</NOBR>
</P>
<p>Farewell, Spoon.  I wish I'd had a chance to meet you before you
left so soon.  We'll miss you.</p>

<h2>Yeah.</h2>

I only spoke to him a couple of times; he patched some of the code in Time::Beat, a silly little module that was one of the first things I did. But it still hurts.

I would like to add he was very active on the DateTime project. He will be missed very much.
