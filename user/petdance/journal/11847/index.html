<p>Last weekend, Amy's cousin brought her boyfriend to Easter dinner.  Turns out that he's a Perl guy who's done stuff on various sourceforge projects.  We chatted about geekery and that was it.
<P>
So last night, we were at Amy's mom's house, and the conversation went something like this:<BLOCKQUOTE>
Glo, Amy's mom: What were you talking to Brian about?  Computer something?<BR>
Me: Yeah, he's a Perl programmer, too<BR>
Glo: A what?<BR>
Amy: Perl, it's a programming language he uses.  I don't understand either.<BR>
Me: Come on, you know some stuff!  Who wrote Perl?<BR>
Amy: Randal?<BR>
Me: No.<BR>
Amy: Damian?<BR>
Me: No.  Ok, maybe it hasn't rubbed off yet...  But at least you knew the names!
</BLOCKQUOTE></p>

<h2>Heh - who wrote Perl...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2003-04-25T16:35:02</h3>
I've written "Perl", but I've not written "perl" {grin}.



<h2>Echo That</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chaoticset/">chaoticset</a> on 2003-04-25T19:25:33</h3>
I've noticed the same thing with Laura -- she has a rough concept of who Damian, Larry, Randal, gnat, and tchrist are.  (Partly because I'm so hard to shut up, I suspect.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  )
<p>
Reabena knows who some of them are too, but she's actually a <em>geek</em>, so I'm not sure that it counts...</p>



<h2>It's all about the community</h2>

<p> <i>Me: No. Ok, maybe it hasn't rubbed off yet... But at least you knew the names!</i> </p>

<p>Ah, she knows the truly important part, then.</p>



<h2>Ummm</h2>

If her boyfriend's a geek, then she's probably a geek by injection...<p>John</p>
