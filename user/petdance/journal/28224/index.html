Today was my 15-year anniversary with 
<a href="http://www.follett.com/">Follett Corporation</a>, with the last five at
<a href="http://www.titlewave.com/">Follett Library Resources</a>.
Today, I also gave my two-week notice.
</p>
<p>
Everybody at work was dumbfounded.  Pete thought I was making it up.
</p>
<p>
I'm going to be working with 
<a href="http://socialtext.com/">Socialtext</A>.  It's exciting to have the
opportunity to work for a Silicon Valley startup, without having to move
to California.  It will be great to work with a bunch of Perl friends that
I already know (Casey West, Ingy, Dave Rolsky, Kirsten Jones), and even
more cool folks that I only know a bit so far. The stuff they're doing
with enterprise-level collaborative software really grabs me, and I
think it's the way software development is going to go in the next decade.
</p>
<p>
It's going to be radically new, since I've been working for sizable
companies for 20 years, and now I'm going to a startup.  But it's also
going to be the same thing I do now, working through IRC and AIM with
a lot of open source projects.
</p>
<p>
I'm psyched.
</p>

Hey, the folks I'll be leaving behind made up an internal wiki page of "books that we need to get since Andy's taking all his" and your <i>Practical Subversion</i> was one of 'em.

Startups can be fun! Hope this is one of them<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>I don't believe it, either</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2006-01-04T15:42:57</h3>
<p>I'm with your dumbfounded coworkers.  I think you're making it up.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Congratulations!  I hope you find it as wonderful (or preferably more) as your present position.</p>
