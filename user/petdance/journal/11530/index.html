<p>Just got this in the mail.  It made my day, and it just adds fuel to something I've been thinking about recently.  The article he discusses is one that <A HREF="/user/merlyn/">Randal</A> wrote recently.
<ECODE>
I ran into the Linux Mag with the article about
WWW:Mechanize.  It finally got me interested in Perl
(had been using PHP on some stuff).  Coming from a VB,
Java, C++ and C# background it took me a while to get
used to the sigils. lol.  Been playing with it for a
couple of weeks now.  I had been looking for a tool
like WWW::Mechanize for a long time.  Any plans to
expand on this module?<br/><br/>... # many questions about WWW::Mechanize<br/><br/>I wanted to let you know that your ideas/code had
brought another person into the Perl fold.<br/><br/>Thanks,
</ECODE>
I was chatting w/Uri the other day and he said, roughly, "No knock on you or Mechanize, but I don't understand its popularity.  It really doesn't do that much."  He's right, of course.  It's basically a wrapper around LWP::UserAgent, HTML::Parser and HTML::Form.
<P>
So why is it so popular?  Is it just that people talk about it?  It fits a niche need that people need and makes it accessible?  It's not even anything I've done so much.  All I did was 
<A HREF="http://use.perl.org/user/petdance/journal/7667">fork it from WWW::Automate</A>, fix some bugs, and talk about it.  
<P>
Is discussion the key?  Is it a social thing?  Is talking about the tools we write what it takes? 
<P>
And how cool is it that a given module sells Perl as a language?  Who would have thought of WWW::Mechanize as a killer app?</p>

<h2>Wrappers</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/koschei/">koschei</a> on 2003-04-08T22:28:42</h3>
Wrappers are good things. Even if they just wrap something simple, they present a simpler interface.<br> <br>Compare using WWW::Mech to creating the UA, sending reuest, sending result to HTML::Form, or LinkExtor, getting a new request object from that, sending that. It's simpler and results in one only having to worry about the methods you provide rather than the methods these arbitrary modules provide.



<h2>Sweet Spot</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2003-04-09T06:38:37</h3>
It's all about the sweet spot.  I must admit that every time I contemplated doing what WWW::Mechanize does, I usually gave up on LWP and went back to curl(1), plus a few bits of shell scripting nastiness.  WWW::Mechanize makes it easy to say what you want, clearly and concisely.
