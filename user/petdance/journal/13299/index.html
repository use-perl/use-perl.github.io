<p>Random thoughts from my trip to Portland:
<P><br/><br/>It's awfully hard to find an electrical outlet in O'Hare, and when
you do, it's rarely by a seat.  Silly me, I left my iBook unplugged
last night, so it only had about an hour of battery time.  I had
to scrounge 110V AC here and there before I got on the plane.
<P>
There's certainly a lot of porn in the airport shops.  I wonder
when most Hustler purchases are made: On the way out on a business
trip? On the way off the plane?
<P>I'm blessed by having a window seat and nobody in the middle seat.  It looks like it's about the only vacant seat on the whole plane.
<P>
We've been sitting on the plane for two hours now, waiting for
thunderstorms to clear up.
<P>
Our in-flight movie is "Chicago", which has been edited for content.
During the Jailhouse Tango, the line "single my ass" has been
changed to "single my eye", but yet all the writhing in lingerie,
especially from Catherine Zeta-Jones, is in there.
We can see asses, but they can't say it.
<P>
Thank goodness for nethack.  Thanks much to David Hand for getting
the darn thing to compile under OS X.
<P>
It's pretty interesting listening to ATC traffic on channel 9.  I can't imagine what it must be like to have to deal
with roughly 100 planes on the ground, all wanting to take off.
Some quotes:<br/><br/>  "I've got so many planes wanting to go,
    I'm just not able to give estimates on individual delays."  <br/><br/><P>
"I know you've got a lot of planes, but we have a
    problem with our plane.  If we're not off by 25, we're not going to be able to go."<BR> "I'll keep that in mind."
<P>
"Is this how people in Seattle feel?" (it's raining like crazy)<BR>
"Yeah, but there's no lines." (There are 70 planes waiting to leave)<BR>
"Thing I hate about that town, you can't find a good cup of coffee."
<P>
"something something something the flight crew."<BR>
"You mean the parking crew."<br/><br/><P>
But I'm here now, and I'm glad I've got my wifi.</p>
