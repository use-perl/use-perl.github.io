<p>This is also getting posted on jobs.perl.org, but until Ask approves it, I'll post it here, too.
<P>
We need a hotshot internals whiz to fix a segfaulting Apache.  Three of us on my team have spent the past two weeks trying to find this insidious problem, and need you to be a set of fresh eyes.  Show off your core-reading, valgrinding, Apache-fu chops.  Work with us to find the problem, solve it, and then use the rest of the week making sure it's actually fixed, and that it doesn't reoccur under load, so we can roll out our project.
<P>
You need to be well versed in: Linux, Apache, mod_perl and PHP.  As asides, we're also using gd, GD, Chart::*, XMLRPC under PHP, and using Oracle as a database backend.
<P>
Most of all, you need to work with me and my team, onsite in McHenry, IL, to find the problem.  We'll fill you in on what we know so far, and then we'll get down to finding the problem.
<P>
Email me at andy@petdance.com (my home account).  Please sell me on why you are the hotshot we want to come in and pull us out of this mess.  Include your rates and any other details.  We'd prefer to have someone local to the Chicago area so we don't have to fly you in and put you up, but if that's what we need to do, we will.</p>

Bam, it's approved.

It sounds like a fascinating problem!  I wish I could get involved, but being in the UK and interested from a strictly amateurish point of view, I'm probably not the best person.

<p>However, with that many components involved, the first thing I would suspect would be multiple versions of shared libraries.  This is like <a href="http://axkit.org/wiki/view/AxKit/FAQ#AxKit%20Segfaults" title="axkit.org">what happened to AxKit</a axkit.org>, which wanted to use XML::Parser under mod_perl.  Except Apache comes with expat statically linked in (oh and it's a slightly different version too).  And because ELF has a global namespace, things get very confused and segfaulty.  This is one area where windows DLLs possibly have the upper hand.

</p><p>Dynamic linking is a fascinating subject.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1558604960" title="amazon.com">John Levines book</a amazon.com> really showed me what's involved, and is a good read.

</p><p>Good luck fixing that segfault!
