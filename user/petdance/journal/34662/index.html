<p><P>(Originally posted at <URL:http://perlbuzz.com/2007/10/evolution-requires-mutation.html>)</p>  

      <p>
        In the past couple of days, I've seen some counterproductive
        social behaviors that help scare away community members and lead
        to boring monoculture: Taking a public dump on the projects of others when they do not directly affect you.
        It's rude, it discourages future risk taking in everyone, 
        it goes against the very nature of open source that has
        brought us here today, and it leads to monoculture.  I'd
        like people to stop.
        </p>

        <h2>Mutation #1: kurila</h2>
        <p>
        Gerard Goossen recently released
        <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/kurila/">kurila</a>,
        a fork of Perl 5 that includes some speedups and tweaks
        that seem to scratch Gerard's itches, as well as bundling extra
        modules.  I'm right now trying to get an interview with
        him to find out more about his project and the reasons
        behind it, because there are probably some interesting
        lessons in there.  However, the disapproval on the Perl 5 Ports list
        was swift and severe.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            All forking based on the Perl 5 syntax and code base,
            throwing away CPAN compatibility, seems to me to be a
            complete worthless waste of time.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
        So what?  Who is anyone to say how Gerard is to use his time?
        Is there any harm here?  No?  Then leave the guy alone, please.
        </p>

        <h2>Mutation #2: lambda</h2>
        <p>
        Eric Wilhelm released <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/lambda/">lambda</a>,
        a distribution that lets you
        use the Greek character lambda (&#955;) as an alias for <tt>sub
        {...}</tt>, apparently as a nod to Python's <tt>lambda</tt>
        keyword for anonymous functions.  Immediately people jumped
        on him saying that the module should go into the Acme::
        namespace, as if the namespaces of CPAN mean anything in
        2007.  There was also this cluck-cluck from someone I figured
        would be more encouraging (and later apologized, as it turns out):
        </p>
            <blockquote>
            Well, if you want to use it in your own code and your work's code,
            that's fine (because I'm sure you find typing CONTROL-SHIFT-EL so much
            easier than "sub {}" :) but if it shows up in your CPAN modules, you
            might get a few complaints since this sugar, while a really nifty hack,
            adds nothing complex but does screw up older editors and will confuse
            the heck out of a lot of maintenance programmers.
            </blockquote>
        <p>
        Personally, I figure that if someone's a smart enough
        programmer to do a hack like the lambda module, he or she
        is also smart enough to figure out potential downsides.
        And so what if he doesn't?  What's the harm here?
        </p>

        <h2>Mutation #3: perlbuzz</h2>
        <p>
        <a href="http://perlbuzz.com/">Perlbuzz</a> itself has always come under this umbrella of disapproval.  Even before
        we announced the site, Skud and I have fended off the comments saying "We already have
        <a href="http://use.perl.org/">use.perl.org</a>, we don't need Perlbuzz."  Maybe not, 
        but why do you care if we start the site?  Why does it bother you?  And why do you 
        find it necessary to tell us that we're embarking on a waste of time?
        </p>
        <p>
        I hope that in the past few months, the work that Skud and I have done have shown
        you, the reader, that Perlbuzz is a worthwhile addition to the Perl community,
        and a valuable news source that overlaps other news sources while not being a subset.
        What if Skud and I had listened to the <i>tsk tsk</i> of the doubters?
        Perl would be right where we it was before, with nothing new.
        </p>
        <h2>Evolution requires mutation</h2>
        <p>
        Why are we so quick to take a dump on the projects of others?
        The only way anything interesting happens is that people
        try weird, new things and see what sticks.  What if Larry
        had listened to those way back when who said "Ah, we've got
        Awk and shell tools, we don't need Perl?"
        </p>
        <p>
        I fear our tendency to monoculture.  I want crazy new projects to thrive, 
        not get squashed at their very infancy.  Next time someone comes out with a project
        that you think is silly, congratulate the person rather than scoffing at it.  Who
        knows what it might lead to?
        </p>
<p>(And a big thank you to Jim Brandt for the "Evolution requires mutation" idea.)</p></p>

Weren't you the guy just taking a big dump on the Chicago.pm list? Why not list all the things that you dump on (including use.perl, which you suggested should be taken over by force)? So, when are you going to stop taking big dumps?<br><br>So what if people dump on ideas? It's better than telling people that public debate is forbidden. Perhaps you just don't like open discussion and freedom.<br><br>

For anyone else reading this, if you take any of brian's assertions seriously and are concerned about them, please let me know and I'll refute each.  Otherwise, I'll let this lie.

Someone sent me a chat transcript from August 26, although I asked Pudge about this today and he says the suggestion was never that serious:<p><blockquote><div>michaelschwern: One proposition was for someone to propose to take over maintenance of use.perl from pudge.<br>Andy Lester: But all this gets back to my original premise<br>Andy Lester: of where are people to do shit?<br>michaelschwern: ?<br>Andy Lester: OK, so say we in this room says "Let's overhaul use.perl.org"<br>Andy Lester: Who's going to do it?<br></div></blockquote><br><br>As for the other thing I mentioned starts with <a href="http://mail.pm.org/pipermail/chicago-talk/2007-October/004458.html" title="pm.org">a thread started by Andy on the Chicago.pm list</a pm.org>. Basically, Andy's stil upset that we started Windy City Perl Mongers, and likes to "take a dump" on it from time to time.<br><br>So, refute away Andy, or be a man and admit that you dump on things as much as anyone else does.

I read the whole thread. Andy's first post was terse but I would not call it a dump and it did foster other talk of which Andy took part and did not dump. I don't see the point here. Not being involved in the Chicago.pm, I would agree with Andy's posts. Especially when you read the second one was created because "Perl lunch" notices were bouncing. After that Andy gave another good suggestion of creating a "social" list for things of that sort under Chicago.pm.<br><br>I read it all and I didn't see dumping.<br><br>Caveat:<br><br>I don't know Andy<br>I don't know if there is a history of dumping<br>

<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2007-10-15T07:32:14</h3>
<p>OK, I'm very confused.  I know and like both you and Andy, so perhaps that doesn't help, but I read that thread and I didn't see any dumping.    You have two lists for the Chicago area.  Andy doesn't think that makes sense and others disagree.  Of course, your definition of "dumping" could be considerably different from my own and even if our definitions were the same, the criteria could be subjective enough that we still couldn't agree.</p>

However "dumping" and exchanging ideas on something are totally different things.<br><br>"I am not sure why you did this could you fill me in?" is much better than "You did what? That sucks and you are stupid for doing it!". Even if after you get the explanation and don't agree you can still say "I see what you did but I don't think it will work."<br><br>So the Perl community should foster an exchange of ideas and polite discourse and discourage "dumping".<br><br>I don't know any of the "background" issues that caused the article to be written but I think the premise is a good one.

I agree with you. same goes to lines like:<br><br>"why do you write this module when there are dozen of them on CPAN do the same thing. stop wasting your time."<br><br>that's the sorta thing discourages people to innovate and invent something better.

<p>Your filibustering is getting old.</p>

<p>Hasn&#8217;t it occured to you that making a habit of loudly berating the critics might just be a tad counterproductive if a friendlier Perl community is what you want to achieve? &#8220;Beatings will continue until morale improves!&#8221;</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t you think it might, f.ex., be more effective to dispense a few friendly encouraging words where you perceive undue stop energy, instead of telling everyone else that they are doing it wrong, days after the fact? If you didn&#8217;t try to avert the problem when it happened, what point is there in castigating the perpetrators after the fact? Do you seriously think that is an effective way to <em>ever</em> get anything whatsoever fixed? Are you trying to be part of the solution?</p>

<p>You are not the community&#8217;s daddy. Lead by example.</p>

Sure there is a big difference but that doesn't mean you can't explain that to the person instead of dumping. "You did what? That sucks!" is never really  acceptable.
