<p>How exhausting the last three days have been!  Moved out of our old house on Tuesday, and bid adieu to our stuff on a truck.  Wednesday was the day of closings, and then yesterday was the day of moving everything in.  Here's what happened to our house:
<UL>
<LI>Cleaner came to do the bathrooms and kitchen
<LI>Carpet installers put in new carpet in top 2 floors
<LI>Garbage man came and took away huge pile of crap from the driveway
<LI>Movers unloaded everything into the house
<LI>Heating/AC guy fixed up the AC, which had apparently never been serviced in the 7 years the folks were there before
<LI>Water softener guy came out and did some magic
<LI>Someone from the city installed a new water meter
<LI>DirecTV guy put up a dish, and was a big ol' crab about it
</UL>
I'd really like a nap right now.</p>

Then again, my wife just had a baby, and I'm complaining about being tired, but she is doing all the work feeding the little tyke. So I guess just watching stuff happen can be tiring sometimes<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Planning all that to happen in a timely manner must've been very tiresome.
