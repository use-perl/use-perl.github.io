<p>I'm looking for recommendations on mailing list software.  I'm playing with chromatic's Mail::SimpleList, but what else is out there?  I'm not a hardcore user, but I'd like to have a half-dozen lists or so.  Web-viewable archives would be nice, too.</p>

Siesta is the mailing list module (with readymade scripts for mailing list foo) by fine london perl mongers (amongst others).
<p>
You can find <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/rclamp/Siesta-0.66/lib/Siesta.pm" title="cpan.org">siesta on CPAN</a cpan.org> as well as the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/rclamp/Mariachi-0.52/" title="cpan.org">mariachi</a cpan.org> mailing list archive tool that goes with it.
</p><p>
There is also an <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/02/05/siesta.html" title="perl.com">article</a perl.com> at perl.com and richard clamp has done several talks on the subject at YAPC and london.pm
</p><p>
Uses perl, Template Toolkit and modern email modules to do everything people have been asking for in the last couple of years.</p>

I remember reading about this long ago, and was suitable impressed. But it looks like there has been no development in over a year and a half after the 0.66 release. Is it that feature complete &amp; bug-free that it's needing nothing? Or has there just not been a CPAN release?

There's stuff in the SVN tree that fixes various things - I should probably do another CPAN release soon.<br> <br>To be honest it's a bit of a catch-22. it works fine (apart from the web frontend but I usually use the command line tool anyway) and, whenever anybody asks for a feature we usually implement it within a day. But without those feature requests coming in I've got other projects that I'm mroe motivated to work on.<br> <br>TBH, there's very little that it can't do that Mailman can do and it's much easier to extend and write custom plugins for. And it has per-user reply-to munging which stops people whining on mailing lists.<br> <br>Best thing to do is try and install it and use the Perl.com article to set up a list. Then tell us if  we need more or better docs. Or other features.<br> <br>Gratuitous ego stroking is good as well.<br> <br>PET YOUR DEVELOPERS TODAY!

I use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/" title="gnu.org">mailman</a gnu.org> for our company's internal list.  It also provides a web archive of postings as well as a friendly web interface for administrators and members.

mailman, although python, is the best tool for the job.  Its currently being use for all the Perl Monger group lists.
