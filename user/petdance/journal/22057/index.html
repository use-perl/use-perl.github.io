<h1>Naming TAP, the Test::Harness protocol</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>I've wanted to name the Test::More protocol for as long as I can remembering being into testing, so that we can write a spec and let others write to it.  So far I have a shell library and a PHP library that create output in that format.
<P>
Now it has a name: "TAP", for Test Anything Protocol.  How did I come up with that name?  Another cross-country brainstorm meeting on 11/4/2004, as seen below:<br/><br/><P>
<b>AIM Chat with Jeff Bisbee, Shawn Boyette, Richard Dice, Jason Gessner, Joe McMahon, Chris Shiflett, Ricardo Julian Besteiro Signes, David Wheeler.</b><br>
<b>Jeff Bisbee</b>: hey guys<br>
<b>Joe McMahon</b>: hi ho<br>
<b>Chris Shiflett</b>: Hello.<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: Hey Joe<br>
<b>Jeff Bisbee</b>: not going to have a lot of time just this minute<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: That's OK.<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: You can bail.<br>
<b>Jeff Bisbee</b>: but I'll watch the conversation<br>
<b>Richard Dice</b>: Hello.<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: Wish Piers was here. He's the king of AIM naming.<br>
<b>Richard Dice</b>: Sorry... what was the topic of this chat again? It flashed on my screen too quickly.<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: The protocol that Perl uses for testing needs a name<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: ok 1<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: ok 2<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: ok 3<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: etc<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: Shiflett's doing some stuff with Geoff Young doing PHP testing from Perl.<br>
<b>Richard Dice</b>: Call it "a-okay!" (or given my own proclivities, "eh-okay")<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: And we need to have a NAME for the protocol so we can say "You have to be able to write to this protocol."<br>
<b>Jason Gessner</b>: pOKe<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: Good.<br>
<b>Casey West has joined this chat.</b><br>
<b>Jason Gessner</b>: perl's OK for everybody<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: Keep dumping ideas.<br>
<b>Joe McMahon</b>: K<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: I suggested POK<br>
<b>Richard Dice</b>: Sorry.... I need a bit more description. What it seems like you're describing is the functioning of the test harness. Protocols... aren't those network things?<br>
<b>Pete Krawczyk has joined this chat.</b><br>
<b>Pete Krawczyk</b>: Afternoon.<br>
<b>Richard Dice</b>: Or, when applied to the programming interface to them, APIs?<br>
<b>Casey West</b>: protocols are interfaces<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: Nope. Test::More just generates "ok 1\nok 2\n" etc<br>
<b>Chris Shiflett</b>: green light protocol<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: and Test::Harness parses it.<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: That format needs a name.<br>
<b>Chris Shiflett</b>: nod<br>
<b>Casey West</b>: The Perl Test Harness has an interface with the output of testing scripts. Andy wants to name that interface.<br>
<b>Chris Shiflett</b>: pokay<br>
<b>Casey West</b>: And, well, he just said that. <br>
<b>Jeff Bisbee</b>: mmm'k<br>
<b>Jason Gessner</b>: hehe<br>
<b>Jason Gessner</b>: i like mmmm k<br>
<b>Pete Krawczyk</b>: Doesn't Test::More also generate 1..n and #diag too?><br>
<b>Jeff Bisbee</b>: south park <br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: Pete: Yes.<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: I was simplifying.<br>
<b>Chris Shiflett</b>: mmmk protocol, yeah <br>
<b>chromatic has joined this chat.</b><br>
<b>Chris Shiflett</b>: nod format<br>
<b>Casey West</b>: PTH - Perl Test Harness. Not very creative, but descriptive.<br>
<b>Joe McMahon</b>: count-ok<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: chromatic: We're naming the Perl test9ing protocol, so that PHP can call it something.<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: But Test::Harness is the harness.<br>
<b>Jason Crome has joined this chat.</b><br>
<b>Casey West</b>: Well, "PTH Format"<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: The goal here is that ANYTHING can write that format.<br>
<b>chromatic</b>: PHP, eh?<br>
<b>Pete Krawczyk</b>: I like "STP" - simplified testing protocol<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: Shell, PHP, C++, whatever.<br>
<b>2</b>:15 PM<br>
<b>Jason Gessner</b>: PCP<br>
<b>Jason Crome</b>: good afternoon everyone<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: I already have code to do the first two.<br>
<b>Casey West</b>: It rolls off the tongue, if your tongue is limp or stuck to a flag poll.<br>
<b>Jason Gessner</b>: perl confirmation protocol<br>
<b>chromatic</b>: test_format_HarNessPer_l<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: and then I'm going to distrbute them in T::H<br>
<b>Richard Dice</b>: TOF -- testing output format<br>
<b>Shawn Boyette</b>: THHPT (The HTTP Harness for Perl Testing) (apologies to Breathed)<br>
<b>Pete Krawczyk</b>: I don't think "perl" should be part of it, because while its home is Perl, it is portable to other areas too.<br>
<b>chromatic</b>: As far as I can tell that follows PHP best practice naming conventions. It has everything: camel case, odd word order, and underscores in the wrong places.<br>
<b>Chris Shiflett</b>: scoop<br>
<b>Chris Shiflett</b>: the scoop<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: I agree with Pete:<br>
<b>Casey West</b>: TRF - test reporting format; TRP - test reporting protocol<br>
<b>Joe McMahon</b>: right - even Java could use it<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: EVEN JAVA!<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: It's part of my Evil Plan to have anyone able to write it, so that they can I&lt;prove&gt; anything.<br>
<b>chromatic</b>: Portable Test Report Protocol<br>
<b>Richard Dice</b>: Yeah... it's about time we inflict some of our shite on the Java people for a change.<br>
<b>Joe McMahon</b>: TAP - test anything protocol<br>
<b>Chris Nandor has joined this chat.</b><br>
<b>Casey West</b>: PTP - Practical Testing Protocol<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: TAP is a good idea.<br>
<b>Jeff Bisbee</b>: tap is good<br>
<b>Kevin Meltzer has joined this chat.</b><br>
<b>Jeff Bisbee</b>: Happy Gilmore... just _tap_ it in<br>
<b>Casey West</b>: TAP works<br>
<b>Joe McMahon</b>: tests on TAP<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: And so I say to you, Tap into America!<br>
<b>Jason Crome</b>: TAP is good<br>
<b>Chris Nandor</b>: i like tap. lots of good Spinal Tap references possible.<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: Keep going.<br>
<b>Chris Nandor</b>: like i said <br>
<b>Richard Dice</b>: Only if I get to write Spinal::TAP<br>
<b>Joe McMahon</b>: turn on the TAP<br>
<b>Jeff Bisbee</b>: TAP::That::Ass<br>
<b>Casey West</b>: The output engine could be TAP::Microphone<br>
<b>chromatic</b>: TAP WFM<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: OTOH, it's hard to google on TAP<br>
<b>Kevin Meltzer</b>: Guinness::On::TAP<br>
<b>Richard Dice</b>: (The double colons in the middle are actually umlauts.)<br>
<b>Nat Torkington has joined this chat.</b><br>
<b>Nat Torkington</b>: what?<br>
<b>Chris Nandor</b>: who?<br>
<b>Kevin Meltzer</b>: I'm in this late, I like "TAP", but what's it stand for?<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: We're naming the Perl testing protocol.<br>
<b>Richard Dice</b>: Test Anything Protocol.<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: Test Anything Protocol<br>
<b>Shawn Boyette</b>: Testicles And Penis<br>
<b>Kevin Meltzer</b>: Test It Today<br>
<b>Pete Krawczyk</b>: Generic Universal Testing Syntax- GUTS<br>
<b>Richard Dice</b>: Sounds like a Steve Jackson game.<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: Does "TAP" mean anything else?<br>
<b>Nat Torkington</b>: what's the heart of the testing protocol? daily tests? feature tests? consistency? coverage? .... ?<br>
<b>Kevin Meltzer</b>: Test All Perl<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: Gessner: Weren't we going to write HTTP::Tap at one point?<br>
<b>Chris Shiflett</b>: rip - red ink protocol, like red ink used for grading papers<br>
<b>chromatic</b>: Nat, just the ok/not ok stuff.<br>
<b>Casey West</b>: This is naming simply the output format from tests that conforms to Perl's test harness requirements.<br>
<b>Joe McMahon</b>: couple of brand names - TAP Air Portugal<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: Nat: We just need to name the "ok 1\nok 2\n" thing, so that PHP et al can write to it.<br>
<b>Nat Torkington</b>: PERT = Perl's Regression Tests<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: That's a mis-Google waiting to happen.<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: But it could be anything, too<br>
<b>Pete Krawczyk</b>: Nat: I personally would like to keep Perl out of it to encourage other langs to pick it up<br>
<b>Pete Krawczyk</b>: The name, that is<br>
<b>Casey West</b>: Test Reporting Language - TRL. MTv can bite me.<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: Yes, it's not a Perl thing.<br>
<b>Nat Torkington</b>: I just tried to Google a bunch of project names, and it's almost impossible when they're real english words. Name it something like STF2004 (Simple Test Format) so that it can easily be googled for.<br>
<b>Kevin Meltzer</b>: All Your Tests Belong To Us<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: And really, Test Anything Protocol is pretty wide open.<br>
<b>Kevin Meltzer</b>: *ducks*<br>
<b>Joe McMahon</b>: STP - simple testing protocol (collision)<br>
<b>Pete Krawczyk</b>: Test Reporting Syntax - TRS! Then we can have "TRS Reports"<br>
<b>Pete Krawczyk</b>: wait, d'oh<br>
<b>Pete Krawczyk</b>: wrong acronym<br>
<b>Chris Shiflett</b>: rifts - red ink format for testing stuff<br>
<b>Pete Krawczyk</b>: Test Protocol Syntax<br>
<b>Nat Torkington</b>: CTOF, common test output format?<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: "I see you forgot your code coverage page on your TPS report."<br>
<b>Joe McMahon</b>: CTP - common test protocol<br>
<b>Nat Torkington</b>: TTS, The Test Syntax. pron: "titties"<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: I want it pronouncable<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: like prove.<br>
<b>Kevin Meltzer</b>: Are we thinking of a name, or an acronym to build a name from?<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: I would prefer a name.<br>
<b>Chris Shiflett</b>: fiddle<br>
<b>Kevin Meltzer</b>: Generic Testing Protocol<br>
<b>Jesse Sheidlower has joined this chat.</b><br>
<b>Pete Krawczyk</b>: I would imagine we could probably backronym most any name<br>
<b>chromatic</b>: mm, testzilla<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: Hey Jesse<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: Let's ask the OED guy!<br>
<b>Casey West</b>: "agent 42", just like you see in random packs of underwear that's been tested by agent $N.<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: Why fiddle?<br>
<b>Kevin Meltzer</b>: Open Test Protocol<br>
<b>Joe McMahon</b>: inspector 9<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: But it's not open.<br>
<b>Nat Torkington</b>: heh, call it the Universal Testing Format, Version 1. UTF-1. confuse the shit out of everyone.<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: It's whatever I say! hah!<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: TXML!<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: TESTING XML!<br>
<b>Chris Shiflett</b>: fiddle - no good reason, other than it tells you whether you need to keep fiddling<br>
<b>Kevin Meltzer</b>: Is it really a protocol?<br>
<b>Joe McMahon</b>: bad andy no biscuit<br>
<b>Chris Shiflett</b>: and because fiddle is fun to say<br>
<b>Jeff Bisbee</b>: dalek? <br>
<b>chromatic</b>: Test Control Language!<br>

<b>Andy Lester</b>: ooooh<br>
<b>Joe McMahon</b>: axioms<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: keep going, Casey.<br>
<b>Andy Lester</b>: evidence?<br>
<b>Nat Torkington</b>: call it Simple Test Output Protocol, and postfix the language name. STOP-Perl, STOP-PHP. I think we can all get behind that.<br>
<b>Kevin Meltzer</b>: NOOK<br>
<b>Casey West</b>: proof, really, that's the best I can do. <br>

I think "Office Space" is a funny movie, just like I think Dilbert is a funny comic strip.  However, I don't want anyone to think that I go along with the premise that "work sucks, everything related to work sucks, bitch bitch bitch."</p>

<h3><a href="/user/jhorwitz/">jhorwitz</a> on 2004-11-29T23:21:22</h3>
Actually, TAP is a common protocol used for pager communications over modems.  More details <a href="http://www.gsmfavorites.com/sms/tap/" title="gsmfavorites.com">here</a gsmfavorites.com>.
<p>
But realistically, if you're dead set on using TAP, I don't think there will be much confusion between the two.</p>

<h2>Any C library implementations?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nik/">nik</a> on 2004-11-30T08:27:47</h3>
Do you know of any C library implementations (presumably equivalent to Test::More in functionality).<br> <br>A few weeks back I finished converting most of FreeBSD's test regression suite (/usr/src/tools/regression for those of you on a FreeBSD system; http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/tools/regression/ if you're not) and one of the ToDo items there is replace most of the ASSERT() calls in the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.c tests with calls to an ok() from a hypothetical libtest.so...

<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2004-11-30T10:58:40</h3>
Not that I know of, no, but I can't imagine it'd be too difficult.

<h2>Re:Any C library implementations?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/geoff/">geoff</a> on 2004-11-30T15:01:13</h3>
I have it in mind to add TAP support to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Apache-Test/" title="cpan.org">Apache-Test</a cpan.org> for Apache-based C modules, similar to the way we've done for php.  the logical extension of this (for me) is to also provide python and parrot support, since between perl, php, python, parrot, and C we would have testing for just about all the <code>mod_*</code> bases covered from a single point of entry.  I'll post a link here when I get around to it... <i>someday</i>.  <br> <br><br/><br/>and yes, I know <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/chromatic/journal/" title="perl.org">chromatic</a perl.org> is working on the parrot bindings.  once he finishes those it will be simple to take care of <a href="http://www.smashing.org/mod_parrot/" title="smashing.org">mod_parrot</a smashing.org> for <a href="http://www.smashing.org/" title="smashing.org">Jeff</a smashing.org>.
