<p>I've got a new job.  I'm no longer at <a href="http://socialtext.com/">Socialtext</a> doing wikis, but am back at <a href="http://www.flr.follett.com/">Follett Library Resources</a>.
<p>
I used to be the manager of the Development department here at FLR, but now I'm just a plain ol' Senior Programmer.  The current manager is a guy I hired years ago who is a great leader, and a natural for the position, and so working for him, with our roles reversed, is no trouble whatsoever.  It's great to work in a company again with real management.
<P>
My mom asked me "Do you like not having the boss responsibilities? Do you have aspirations to move up again?"  I really don't see my move back here as "down".  It's just a different role.  When I took the manager job, it wasn't because I wanted to move "up", but because it was part of what I needed to do to make things happen.  I had to hire people to make the department better, and I needed to be the technical leader.  After five years of getting the department into shape, I had come to the end of what I wanted to do, so I left.  Now that I'm back, it's with a new set of challenges, leading work on a new project overhauling a website for a sister company,  doing new cleanup and refactoring.</p>
