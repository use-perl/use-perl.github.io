ack, my replacement for grep for 95% of the times programmers use grep, just got <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/ack">released to CPAN with version 1.70</a>.
</p>
<p>
At long last, you can now get contextual lines before and after matched lines, just like GNU grep's -A, -B and -C options.  You can also match on a specific line number or range of line numbers with the new --line option. For example, if you want to see the first line of every Perl file in a tree, you'd just do <tt>ack --line=1 --perl</tt>.  Thanks very much to Torsten Biix for putting both these features together for me.</p>
<p>
Finally, Elliot Shank pointed out that one of my favorite features, the <tt>-1</tt> option, was never documented.  Now it is.  The <tt>-1</tt> option says "stop after the first match of any type."  If you find yourself acking for lines, or searching for a specific file with <tt>ack -g</tt> and then having to Ctrl-C to stop the search process, just add a <tt>-1</tt> and Ctrl-C no longer.
</p>
<p>
ack is available in the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/ack">ack distribution</a> on CPAN, or by installing the module App::Ack from the CPAN shell.  You can also download the <a href="http://ack.googlecode.com/svn/tags/latest/ack-standalone">single-file version</a> direct from Subversion and drop it right into your ~/bin directory.</p>

Thank you for ack.  Thank you doubly for ack-standalone!

You're very welcome.  Do you just toss the ack-standalone in your ~/bin dir and carry it around?  Or is there another reason it's a ++ ?

This is the first I had heard of the standalone version.  Previously I only had ack installed on my personal system because I am reluctant to do system level installs on any of our servers and I've never had any luck with user-directory cpan installs.<br><br>So, I just copied ack-standalone into ~/bin on one of the servers and it worked great.

That's why I have it like that.  I think I'm going rename it to ack-single-script or maybe ack-no-dependencies so people notice it more.<br/><br/>
If you don't have your ~/bin directory in Subversion, do so.  Makes it even easier to have everything synced between your machines.  The way I do it is documented at <a href="http://xoa.petdance.com/How_to:_Keep_your_home_directory_in_Subversion" title="petdance.com">http://xoa.petdance.com/How_to:_Keep_your_home_directory_in_Subversion</a petdance.com>.

Yeah, I was just thinking of giving that a try.  Perhaps I can even keep ack automatically up to date using svn:externals and a symlink?

<p>If others are anything like me, then the problem isn&#8217;t that people don&#8217;t figure out what &#8220;standalone&#8221; means, it&#8217;s that they install <code>ack</code> from CPAN and never bother to look at its website (let alone the Google Code project). But there is no mention of <code>ack-standalone</code> whatsoever in the distro docs (ie. the parts that search.cpan.org exposes prominently), save for a passing one in the <code>Changes</code>. Not even the installation instructions in the <code>README</code> say anything about it. I knew it exists only because I saw a post of yours mentioning it somewhere on some mailing list.</p>

<p>If you want people to notice it, advertise it in the <code>README</code> and the POD.</p>
