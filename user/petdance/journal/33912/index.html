<p>I'd like to see some sort of "Help Wanted" or "Help Available" board that would let people post their projects that they need help on, or where people could say "I have these skills, I'd like to help on a project."
<P>
I'm almost thinking it'd be a wiki, but it could also be like jobs.perl.org.  I very specifically do not it to be "Just post to your use.perl journal", because not everyone reads everyone's use.perl journal, and plus I want to be able to post new people who are eager to help on something to a dedicated place where their skills could get used.
<P>
Thoughts?</p>

It's not exactly what you want, and it's fairly dead, but there's <a href="http://apprentice.perl.org/" title="perl.org">http://apprentice.perl.org/</a perl.org><br><br>It could probably be repurposed, revitalized, and so on.  I don't know if there's a benefit to that.

That would be very nice. I have been looking for something like that for a while. I finally helped Mr. Bunce get the new DBI/DBD faq site going.<br><br>I would definately post to it. It really wouldn't matter what as long as I was helping the Perl community and using Perl to do it.  : )

That sounds like a fantastic idea, though I'm not sure "apprentice" quite fits the bill.  Maybe something more like hits.perl.org, or do.perl.org, or a completely separate site.  Something like Amazon's mechanical Turk that could be easily extended to the open source community in general.<br/><br/>This sounds like a job for Catalyst!  Also, since the site doesn't exist yet, I guess I'll just say here that I'd be willing to help make it happen<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
