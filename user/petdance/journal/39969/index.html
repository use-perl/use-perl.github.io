I know that a lot of people are moving their blogs over to <URL:http://blogs.perl.org>, leaving <URL:http://use.perl.org> behind.  Part of the frustration is that Chris Nandor, Pudge, hasn't done much to modernize use.perl.org, but hey, it's Pudge's choice, and he runs the site, and we're all here by grace of him running it.  Beggars and choosers, y'know.  If you're frustrated with a Perl news site, you can go <a href="http://perlbuzz.com/">start your own</a>.
</p>

<p>
So certainly, I think this spam I just received is just out of line.

<p>I've made several offers to accept styling and so on. While I think mere styling is a stupid reason to dislike a site, I've made the offer.  No takers.  Shrug.</p>

<p>Oh and BTW I've never heard of blogs.perl.org. Not sure I see the point. Worse commenting system, slightly prettier.</p>

The big points I've heard was that it's easier to write in and it can handle inline images.

<p>Images makes sense.  Not sure I can recall anyone complaining about useperl being hard to write in.  Maybe different kinds of non-HTML markup?</p>

<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2009-12-01T17:43:37</h3>
<p>And tags, and trackbacks, and syntax highlighting, doesn't look completely awful when not logged in, OpenID support, etc.  In a week or so, it should be set up on a new, beefier server and we should be much closer to prime time!</p>

Why do you continue to evade the issue of spam being sent out offering a way to eliminate you?  Aren't you concerned for your safety?

<p>No, I am not concerned. I have a<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... plan.</p>

<h2>Mmm maybe ..</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/thickas/">thickas</a> on 2009-12-02T08:44:00</h3>
Is this more of the less-anachronistic Perl way of pushing people out the door, especially those who do stuff ?<p>
I hope not.</p><p>
Thanks pudge for use.perl.org. I like it and while I have nothing much to say, I like reading this site and do so on a daily basis.</p><p>
The writing has shall we say has a certain cognitive resonance.</p><p>
Strangely enough, to me it looks crisp and readable, but then I have always thought that pictures unless they are good (and usually that means the products of artists who illustrate their prose [Ardizone, Burningham<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...]) don't add much.</p><p>
By comparison, the look of say PerlBuzz is Ok too, but the tone<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.... the politically-correct-call-no-one- a-slimey-mofo is not one that appeals to me.</p><p>
I also read Ars Technica, and although it has pictures (and ads ad-infinitum) its the content that gets my attention.</p>

It's sad that the philosophy of trying not to be a dick to other people is tarred with the broad brush of "politically correct," thus making it easy to dismiss.
<p>
Clearly, there is a market for websites where calling others a slimy mofo is encouraged.  I'd never considered this as a market niche.</p>

<p>This should be handled soon.  The new server has finally been allocated and work will begin (tonight, I think) to start installing the MT dependencies.</p>
