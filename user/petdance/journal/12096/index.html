<h2>A symptom of Hollywood</h2>

<i>Obviously, in the terms of this movie, any school where the kids have to study is bad, just as a school where the kids can run around and raise hell is good.</i>

<p>
Unfortunately Hollywood plants this seed in several school related films. You're not cool unless you skip school (Ferris Bueller), treat school as a joke (Grease) or the only sane one in a bunch of weirdos (The Faculty). You also get the view that 'jocks' are all bozos. Maybe they are, but I seriously doubt it. There probably are films that do treat studying responsibly but I can't recall one.
</p><p>
Personally I find too many of the "comedy" movies coming out of Hollywood very lightweight on any real humour. The last great Eddie Murphy (IMHO) was 48 Hours, since then he's used one of two characters (straight and comedic) in every film. Films such as Dumb and Dumberer only further the cause into mediocrity (then again I am not a Jim Carey fan at all).
</p><p>
Slightly OT, but having seen recently the "initiation ceremony" that has been featured in the <a href="http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_1357393,00.html" title="news24.com">news</a news24.com>, perhaps its about time Hollywood took a turn for the better and made nerds and geeks cool for daring to want a decent education. They're certainly the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/default.asp" title="microsoft.com">ones</a microsoft.com> <a href="http://www.woz.org/" title="woz.org">who</a woz.org> <a href="http://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressroom/html/index.html?ellisonl.html" title="oracle.com">epitomize</a oracle.com> American success stories<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Legally Blonde shows students seriously studying. The "bubblehead sorority valley girl" turns out to be the best student at Harvard Law School.</p>

I knew there had to be one recently, I'd forgotten about Legally Blonde. It was a shame that too many of the characters stuck to stereotypes, though it wouldn't have been the film it was if it hadn't<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>Children's movies</h2>

Just about <em>all</em> movies that get released are children's movies.<p>New excuse for watching only porn: with porn, at least its script (if any) hasn't been thru ten revisions plus reshooting after the test-marketing.</p>
