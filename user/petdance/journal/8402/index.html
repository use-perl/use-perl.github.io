BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Saddam Hussein won another seven-year term as Iraq's president in a referendum in which he was the sole candidate, taking 100 percent of the vote, the Iraqi leader's right-hand man announced Wednesday.
<P>
"This is a unique manifestation of democracy which is superior to all other forms of democracies even in these countries which are besieging Iraq and trying to suffocate it," [a government official] said at a news conference in Baghdad, apparently referring to the United States. 
<P>
"This is a great day to celebrate," [a voter] said. "We are not surprised with the 100 percent vote for the president, because all Iraqis are steadfast to their president, who has been known to them for 30 years."

<blockquote><div>Among the theme songs that have played repeatedly on Iraqi television this
                 week is an Arabic version of Whitney Houston's hit I Will Always Love You.
                 It's the soundtrack for several minutes of footage broadcast on and off all
                 day showing the Iraqi leader kissing babies, hugging elderly women and
                 praying at the country's Muslim shrines. In reality, the sole candidate
                 doesn't need to press the flesh. But that hasn't stopped Iraqi officials and
                 voting officers from touting the referendum as a show of democracy.
