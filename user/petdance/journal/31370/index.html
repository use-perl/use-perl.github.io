<p>The Chicago Hackathon (<a href="http://hackathon.info">http://hackathon.info</A>) is excited to have Krugle part of the proceedings.  Krugle (<a href="http://krugle.com">http://krugle.com</a>) is a search engine for source code, projects, and technical information across the web, and they want your feedback.  The Krugle team wants to hear from Perl programmers about how Krugle can be more useful to the Perl community.
<p>
On Saturday, Krugle will be hosting a demo of Krugle, as well as feeding us pizza.  They're looking for content advisors, feature feedback, and other interesting ideas.  If you're interested, plan on stopping in the main meeting room.  If you're not, just come by, grab some pizza, and head back to hacking.
<p>
Ken Krugler, the founder, will be hosting the demo and conversation. He first cut his coding teeth in the Lisa/Mac vortex, and then spent 15 years solving I18N problems. For the past 18 months he's been obsessing about exploratory vertical search for code. In his spare time, he fiddles with cellular automata.</p>

"What can Krugle do for us that search.cpan.org cannot?"<br><br>Perhaps when indexing files from the CPAN, Krugle can link back to the search.cpan POD docs or something as well?<br>

I don't know what they can do.  The possibilities are endless.  That's why I'm so excited to have them here and listening to what we need.<br/><br/>search.cpan.org hasn't had any radical improvements in years.  I'd love it if Krugle came up with something that leapfrogged search.cpan.org.  There's a lot to be said for the work that's done for profit, rather than volunteer, in terms of motiviation and tuits.
