<p>I just floated this idea to Chicago Perl Mongers.  There was talk about Chicago hosting YAPC 2005, but I'm not sure we're ready for that. But I think a mini-YAPC might be cool. Not a full-blown YAPC, but some sort of mini-convention, more social than tech.<br/><br/><UL>
<LI>Some weekend in, say, mid-February, far enough away from June/July of YAPC.<br/><br/><LI>Weekend = Friday noon to Sunday night.
<LI>Minimal tech: Maybe one or two talks a day.  Lightning talks would be swell.
  Emphasis is on what makes OSCON so great: The hallway sessions.<br/><br/><LI>Family-oriented.  People can bring the spouse(s) and kids.
<LI>Held here in Chicago, or more likely, a suburb like Schaumburg or Arlington Heights, so that people who want to deal with the city can, and those who don't, don't.<br/><br/><LI>Costs would be low, only including the actual costs.<br/><br/><LI>Announce it far enough in advance that people can plan.  Mostly local folks, of course, but who knows who else might show up?  "Local" might mean anything from Minneapolis to Detroit to Green Bay to Memphis.
</UL>
Thoughts?  Anyone done something like this?</p>

<h2>YAPC::Simple::Chicago</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jbisbee/">jbisbee</a> on 2004-08-02T06:01:10</h3>
Sounds like a great idea.  You can count on my wife and I flying up from Florida to attend.
<p>
Even if you don't put a bid together for YAPC 2005, it wouldn't hurt to start compiling information.  You never can be too prepared and if you could wrangle up enough folks to delegate tasks to, it actally can be quite fun.</p>



<h2>Workshop</h2>

We have done something similar twice in Denmark, we called it a workshop.<br> <br> <p> <a href="http://perlworkshop.dk/" title="perlworkshop.dk">http://perlworkshop.dk/</a perlworkshop.dk> <br> </p><p> <a href="http://perlworkshop.de/" title="perlworkshop.de">http://perlworkshop.de/</a perlworkshop.de> <br> </p><p> <a href="http://www.perl.it/workshop/" title="www.perl.it">http://www.perl.it/workshop/</a www.perl.it> <br> </p><p> <a href="http://vienna.pm.org/en_workshop.html/" title="pm.org">http://vienna.pm.org/en_workshop.html/</a pm.org> <br> <br>There are plenty of workshops around...</p>

<p>There were 6 workshops this year: you forgot <a href="http://conferences.mongueurs.net/2004/" title="mongueurs.net">France</a mongueurs.net> and <a href="http://workshop.perlpromo.nl/" title="perlpromo.nl">Netherlands</a perlpromo.nl>.
Until now, Perl workshops have been a European
thing. Rather small, but I would say that the important
word is <i>local</i>. Which means that English is usually <b>not</b> the langage used in most of the talks.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt> </p>

Oh, I did not mean to forget anyone in that sense or create and extensive liste, the URLs was only meant as inspiration and was based on what I could remember and a swift googling...<br> <br>Btw: the Perl Workshops in Denmark have been held in English<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>Perl Skitrip</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ask/">ask</a> on 2004-08-02T06:10:12</h3>
I vote for the Perl Skitrip in February.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>
&nbsp; - ask<br> <br>ps. I think a mini-YAPC would be great.  Maybe with a bunch of 15-20 minute blizzard-talks?



<h2>Sounds fun</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2004-08-02T07:13:06</h3>
I'd probably go if I could crash at someone's place (hint, hint<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br> <br>It's worth it just for a chance to eat at my food Mecca, Soul Vegetarian East (yummy fried vegan food heaven).



<h2>Sounds like a great idea to me...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/speters/">speters</a> on 2004-08-02T19:40:43</h3>
<p>I will probably be showing up from Wisconsin since there aren't a lot of conferences that end up this way.  If you all get this going, please post more information!</p>

<h2>.ca did this</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/KM/">KM</a> on 2004-08-02T21:30:48</h3>
In '04 I believe some folks in Ottowa (?) did this. They had a 1.5 day workshop with day 1 as training type talks, and day 2 as lecture type. Depending on venue costs, and actual people who would attend, it may or may not be fiscally reasonable.<br> <br>But, since you'd have to check into venues and costs... may as well write them down for future use for a YAPC bid<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) In fact, just put one in for YAPC::2005. At the very least, you'll get a taste of the things needed to be checked into, and could be used for a YAPW (Yet Another Perl Workshop).<br> <br>Ask mentioned a Skiing YAPC. A few of us looked into this, and it was fairly expensive to do. Could be looked into again though.<br> <br>What I'd like is another Camp Camel like event. Who's got some land?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
