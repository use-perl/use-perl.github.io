<p>Last time, <A HREF="http://use.perl.org/user/petdance/journal/20393">I dreamt about Jesse Shiedlower</A>.  This time it was Ingy.
<P>
I was at some conference, and I was going to do a presentation, and I was getting my iBook all set up.  And I go to plug the power into the wall, and the end of the power cord is just two bare wires, just the blades that go into the electric outlet.  All the plastic has been burned off of them, and I can't plug it into the wall.  And it was Ingy who had done it.  And he was standing there, laughing at me.  He was proud of how he'd screwed up my presentation.  I was so mad at him.  "Why the fuck did you DO THAT?  Why did you burn my power cord," I yelled at him, and he just kept laughing.

<h2>Is this a trend?</h2>

<p>Back from YAPC::Europe yesterday, after several nights without enough sleep (got to bed at 7 AM on Saturday), I slept in the plane from Belfast to Paris and again in the train from Paris to Lyon.</p>
<p>In the train, I dreamt about several Perl people... We were in a hurry to catch a Perl author to have books signed before he left. At some point, there was a river and Merijn jumped into the water to swim across, while I took the longuest path (using a bridge). Somehow  I managed to arrive a little before him. I woke up before we catched the author we were running after.</p>
<p>Maybe too much Perl conferences? Or is this the beer?</p>

<h2>You need to run an experiment</h2>

Try meeting more Perl conferences and having more beer, and see which causes the dreams.  All in the name of science of course.
