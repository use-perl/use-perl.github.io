<div class="span8">
<p>I've just released Module::Starter 0.02, meant as a replacement for <I>h2xs</I>.
<P>
I think <I>h2xs</I> is very out of date as far as current best practices for modules.  It's also very intimidating for people who just want to create a module, and have no need for all the compiler hoohah that h2xs throws at you.  Module::Starter is meant to make things much eaiser.
<P>
Here's a sample run of Module::Starter's command-line program:
<ECODE>
$ module-starter --module=Foo,Foo::Bar,Foo::Bat --email=andy@petdance.com --author="Andy Lester"<br/><br/>$ find Foo
Foo
Foo/.cvsignore
Foo/Changes
Foo/lib
Foo/lib/Foo
Foo/lib/Foo/Bar.pm
Foo/lib/Foo/Bat.pm
Foo/lib/Foo.pm
Foo/Makefile.PL
Foo/MANIFEST
Foo/t
Foo/t/00.load.t
Foo/t/pod-coverage.t
Foo/t/pod.t<br/><br/>$ cat Foo/Makefile.PL 
use strict;
use warnings;
use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;<br/><br/>WriteMakefile(
    NAME                => 'Foo',
    AUTHOR              => 'Andy Lester <andy@petdance.com>',
    VERSION_FROM        => 'lib/Foo.pm',
    ABSTRACT_FROM       => 'lib/Foo.pm',
    PREREQ_PM => {
        'Test::More' => 0,
    },
    dist                => { COMPRESS => 'gzip -9f', SUFFIX => 'gz', },
    clean               => { FILES => 'Foo-*' },
);
</ECODE>
Comments are welcome, and expected.</p>

Ideally there'd be a local config file that would save me having to type my own name and email address all the time.<br/><br/>And overridable templates for what I'd like in my modules, MANIFEST.skip, extra default tests etc.<br/><br/>(And are bugs *really* to be reported to bug-test-html-tidy@rt.cpan.org?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br/><br/>Tony

Personally I also like a README in there. I note that the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Starter/Starter.pm" title="cpan.org">POD on CPAN</a cpan.org> is difficult to read, perhaps it might be worth adding a cheat, something like 'Below is the example layout of the POD', with a few choice '----' to highlight the block. Or is there a way to stop that from happening ?
<p>
I definitely like Tony's idea of a configuration file. Perhaps something like the one the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/cpan-upload/cpan-upload" title="cpan.org">cpan-upload</a cpan.org> script uses.</p>

<p>
Nope, and it highlights the danger of how I've been doing new module creation: Cut &amp; paste from an existing good module.</p>

<h2>Multiple periods in filenames...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rooneg/">rooneg</a> on 2004-04-05T14:55:43</h3>
Might want to avoid the 00.blah.t style names for the tests.  Multiple periods in filenames tend to screw up VMS systems, IIRC.



<h2>ExtUtils::ModuleMaker</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jbisbee/">jbisbee</a> on 2004-04-05T15:19:39</h3>
Geoff Avery has <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/rgeoffrey/ExtUtils-ModuleMaker-0.32/" title="cpan.org">ExtUtils::ModuleMaker</a cpan.org>, a replacement for h2xs.
<p>
It hasn't been updated in awhile and I do like the name Module::Starter better.  Just wanted to bring it to your attention if you didn't know about it.</p>

Any others that I don't know about?  obra claimed "~dozen" existing similar packages, but that seems high.

On search.cpan.org, just did a search for h2xs and skimmed the results.  ExUtils::ModuleMaker seems like the only one that I could find.
<p>
I take back not being recently updated, Geoff updated it in June of 2003 (during the last YAPC::NA in Boca Raton where he did a presentation on it)
</p><p>
Kinda like does what you want with the command line tool 'modulemaker' (reminds me of brian d foy's 'release').</p>

Barries has Module::Husbandry but I think it's been abandoned in the face of his paid work getting in the way.<br> <br>Ron Savage has Module::MakeDist<br> <br>Jonas B. Neilson has  Module::Template::Setup<br> <br>Those were the ones I found by doing a search of "Module" on search.cpan.org<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... note that I have used Barries Module::Husbandry and it has some nice command line tools for moving files into and out of packages (and I can attest it works under Windows despite the POD).<br> <br>

There is Mark Fowler's mmm script (which has the template support that other people asked for), and I am still working on my scriptdist script which I have been using to do the same thing.<br> <br>When I was researching this for an upcoming TPJ article, I found all sorts of prior implementations, most of which are not on CPAN. As with a lot of things people hack on something to get what they want, and that is where their work stops.
