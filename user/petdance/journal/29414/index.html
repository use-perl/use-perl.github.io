<p>I just released Test::Harness 2.57_06.  I removed failing test percentages from the output.  It's always seemed silly to have shades of grey in what is a black/white issue: Did the tests pass or fail?</p>

I don't like the change myself. I'm bright enough to figure out that anything less than 100% pass is bad when developing.<br><br>When using other peoples test suites seeing, for example, 99% ok tells me something very different from seeing 3% ok. For me the difference between "nearly there apart form this bit of functionality that I don't care about" and "completely f**ked" is useful. Yes I can figure it out from the test/pass numbers - but the percentage gives me a handy overview. Math is hard!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>Not something I feel<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/that/ strongly about - but I don't see the utility  of the change myself (beyond code simplification in T::H).

An implied question when I do a test run is "Did I screw up something fundamental, or just some edge case?" Numbers help me get that answer.

You get the numbers.  You just don't get the percentages.
<p>
There's no difference between blowing 3 tests out of 100, or 3 out of 10,000.  So 97% is no worse than 99.97%.</p>

<p>
As an alternative, how about replacing the percentages with some pithy text?
</p>
<p>
"You missed one."<br>
"A pair slipped by."<br>
"You've got a few problems."<br>
"Uh, oh. Not good."<br>
"Hands up, and back away from that keyboard."
</p>

I use the percentages to track progress, and it's something I can point customers to.<br><br>Was there some other reason for this change?

Other than removing extra code, and not wanting to support the "correctness" of that percentage, no.  I had a ticket in RT where 99.994% rendered as 100%, which was misleading.<br/><br/>But mostly it was because it just doesn't make sense to talk about tests in a way other than pass/fail.<br/><br/>The whole end-of-the-run reporting system is on my short list to overhaul anyway.

<h2>Makes sense to me</h2>

Given that you are still reporting the number of failed tests, not displaying the fairly meaningless percentage is no loss at all.
