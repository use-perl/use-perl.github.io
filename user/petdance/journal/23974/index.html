<div class="span8">
<p>I'm finally convinced that cuddled elses are bad.  Here's a script I wrote to uncuddle them in all our Perl and PHP:
<ECODE>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w -i -p<br/><br/>if ( s/^ (\s*) } \s* (els(e|if|eif))\b \s* /$1}\n$1$2 /mxs ) {
    s/\s+$//; # Strip trailing whitespace while we're at it
    $_ = "$_\n";
}
</ECODE>
so now you can just say "./uncuddle `find . -name '*.pm'`"
<P>
To be clear what cuddled elses are, it's this:
<ECODE>
if ( ) {
    ...
} else {
    ...
}
</pre>
instead of
<ECODE>
if ( ) {
    ...
}
else {
    ...
}
</ECODE>
The key is that having the <TT>else</TT> outdented shows that it's a point of the flow of control.  It all the more important if you get into elsifs.
<ECODE>
if ( A ) {
    ...
} elsif ( B ) {
    ...
} elsif ( C ) {
    ...
} else ( D ) {
    ...
}
</pre>
instead of the more clear
<ECODE>
if ( A ) {
    ...
}
elsif ( B ) {
    ...
}
elsif ( C ) {
    ...
}
else ( D ) {
    ...
}
</ECODE>
Yes, it adds one more line to the screen.  I'm OK with that.</p>

If you don't mind using a sledgehammer to pound this nail, you can always use perltidy, which lets you do it either way (your way by default, I IRC).

I wanted a surgical approach w/o resorting to perltidy.  My solution also fixes the PHP code we have that cuddles.

I don't cuddle them myself, but it always struck me as one of those silly stylistic things that you have to be consistent on, but which choice you make doesn't really matter.<br> <br>But I'm interested in cases where someone gave up a stylistic choice like that, because it may be that there really is a reason to prefer one over the other.<br> <br>Thanks,<br>Ben

If you can't succinctly explain why they are bad, I doubt that a lengthy explanation in a book will convince me.

I did succinctly explain in the original post.

I beg to differ.  You asserted that one is more clear, and gave only one reason for anyone to think so: that uncuddled "shows that it's a point of the flow of control."  But so does cuddled.<br>

<i>The key is that having the else outdented shows that it's a point of the flow of control. It all the more important if you get into elsifs.</i> <br> <br>But the code following the condition is indented so I don't see what uncuddling would gain you when it comes to visual clarity. Furthermore, by cuddling them it becomes obvious that the various if/elseif/.../else cases are really part of one bigger statement where only one of the indented code-blocks is ever executed.<br> <br>Finally, the lines you save by cuddling could make a function just fit on the screen which is a good thing as it respects the principle of locality (i.e. everything about a function can be seen without the need for scrolling).

Seconded.  I find "} else {" or "} elsif (COND) {" to be a natural "step" in my program.  Putting that on two separate lines won't gain me any more understanding.

<h2>Etymology?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/offerk/">offerk</a> on 2005-04-20T08:09:17</h3>
OT, but I'm curious - does anyone know where/when the use of "cuddle" as used here (i.e. with respect to brace positioning) originated?<br>I couldn't find any reference to this use on Wikipedia, M-W or dictionary.com .



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Etymology?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/orbit/">orbit</a> on 2005-08-31T02:44:20</h3>
Probably (in this case, anyway) from the recommendation in Damian Conway's recent book, Perl Best Practices, in which Damian advises against 'cuddled' else's
