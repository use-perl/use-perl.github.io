<h1>Socialtext wiki beta testers needed</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>I work for Socialtext, and we make an industrial-strength wiki for  
large groups.  For details on what makes Socialtext more powerful  
than most wikis, see <a href="http://www.socialtext.com/products/features">http://www.socialtext.com/products/features</a>.
<P>
We're releasing Socialtext as open source.  The official release will  
be at OSCON in Portland, but right now, I need beta testers who are  
willing to test out the tarballs and the installation instructions,  
and provide feedback.
<P>
I need someone fairly technically savvy, because part of the install  
may be debugging what we missed in the instructions or tarballs.   
I'll probably have multiple releases of the tarballs, too, as I get  
feedback from the testers.  Note that this is just testing the  
install & installation instructions, not the application itself.
<P>
Beta testers must meet these minimum requirements:
<UL>
<LI><br/><br/>Needs a box to play with that they don't mind screwing up
<LI>Must have root on the box
<LI>Able to run Postgres
<LI>Apache 1 & mod_perl, optionally with Apache 2 too
<LI>Perl 5.8.4
<LI>Experience installing apps from tarballs, not Debian or RPM  
packages
<LI>Availability to work with me on problems if I need to get some  
post-mortems.
</ul><br/><br/>If you're interested, please email me at andy.lester=&gt;socialtext.com,  
NOT here, with the words "OSR beta" in the subject.  Please let me  
know what system you're running.  We aren't supporting Windows at  
this point, but will be glad to hear from Mac folks.
<P>
Thanks,<br>
Andy<br/><br/></p>

I keep seeing this wordgroup, and although I think I know what it means in terms of hardware, in the context of software I have no idea.<br><br>Maybe you want to explain this a little?<br><br>You put this as the first thing you say about the wiki, so it's obviously important. And probably you meant to imply that other wikis aren't "industrial strength". But that's about all I can guess...

Lots of wiki packages have basic editing capabilities, but aren't suited to large numbers of users, with different workspaces, RSS feeds, etc.  Socialtext does.
