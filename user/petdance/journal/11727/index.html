The standard "don't whine unless you implement it yourself" approach is a
little dangerous for an open source developer. If you recognize a good
idea from your users, you should either implement it yourself or (in the
case of Perl) make a call-for-action saying it should be done, and see
<B>someone implementing it for you</B>.

<h2>docs</h2>

<p>Something I just don't understand about this whole debate is why the <a href="http://www.bookpool.com/.x/koz9jbsra0/sm/0596000278" title="bookpool.com">camel</a bookpool.com> and the
<a href="http://www.bookpool.com/.x/koz9jbrher/sm/0596001320" title="bookpool.com">llama</a bookpool.com> don't suffice for Perl documentation. I learned Perl from reading (and continuing to read) these books. Perhaps I'm more comfortable with books than I am online docs. Is Shlomi talking about another level of documentation?</p>

He's saying that Larry &amp; Randal should give away the Camel &amp; Llama for free.

DagNabbit, now I'm interested in the whole thing.  I was trying to read about Shlomi without reading everything: conserve my time and gather the perls of wisdom second hand.  Now that I know this dude wants handouts (or, rather, now that the gossip says that he wants handouts), I have to read the whole thing.  Maybe I'll get a laugh out of it.

(heh, for pearls of wisdom, try <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=251071" title="perlmonks.org">this thread</a perlmonks.org> at Perlmonks - Damian's response is priceless.)</p>

<h2>Not just that</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2003-04-23T01:58:25</h3>
But Shlomi suggested other people fix Perl's docs, after he submitted two bad patches for the docs.  If it is so easy to get people to do it, why were his attempts such failures?
