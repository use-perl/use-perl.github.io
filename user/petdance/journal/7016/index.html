<p>My latest little project of necessity is <A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Carp-Assert-More">Carp::Assert::More</A>.
<P>
I've become so spoiled by the swell convenience functions of Test::More that I missed them when I was throwing assertions in code.  So, I started a module of 'em.  
<P>
Down the road, Schwern has asked me to see if I can incorporate them and the rest of Carp::Assert into using Test::Builder, since they're so similar.  My first thought is not a good one: Since Test::Builder uses a singleton, I'm not sure that a piece of code that both Carp::Assert and Test::More could co-exist in a single piece of code.</p>

<p>
Unless I'm tremendously misunderstanding your point, the Test::Builder singleton exists to make that possible.  That's why we wrote it that way.  As long as you can translate things into calls to Test::Builder::ok() somehow, it ought to work.

Here's an example:  I've got a module Foo that asserts regularly.  Now, I go and run some tests against Foo's functions, including those that assert.<blockquote><div> <tt>package Foo;<br> <br>sub wango {<br>&nbsp; my $self = shift;<br>&nbsp; assert_isa( $self, 'Foo' );<br>&nbsp; # Now do my object magic<br>}</tt> </div></blockquote>but then, I also want to test that, so in my<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.t file:<blockquote><div> <tt>my $foo = new Foo;<br>isa( $foo, 'Foo' );<br>my $n = $foo-&gt;wango;<br>ok( $n, 'wango returned non-zero' );</tt> </div></blockquote>In this case, the singleton would be used by (in order) <tt>isa</tt>, <tt>assert_isa</tt> and <tt>ok</tt>.  Test::Builder's singletons counts would get screwed up.
<p>
Or maybe I'm the one who's not understanding....</p>

Oh, I think I understand.  Writing tests for a module that uses Test::Builder can be tricky, yes.  That's why there's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=all&amp;query=Test%3A%3ABuilder%3A%3ATester" title="cpan.org">Test::Builder::Tester</a cpan.org>.

<p>
If we made Carp::Assert use Test::Builder, then EVERY module that uses Carp::Assert (which I hope would be many) would suddenly become one of those tricky modules and people would have to use T::B::T.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(</p>
