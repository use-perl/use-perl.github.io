<p>I'm in the final stages of hiring 
<A HREF="http://jobs.perl.org/job/462">a programmer</A>, and the variety of resumes in the mere 100 or so that I've seen is amazing.  Here are some tips that may help you out next time you're looking for a job (assuming that you're getting your resume directly to me, the hiring manager).<br/><br/><P>
First, and most important: <B>Tell me what you can do for me</B>.
Start your resume and cover letter with a summary of what you can do for me.  Imagine me reading your resume: It's Monday morning, I have 50 file attachments in my inbox, plus I have Real Work to do.  I'm not going to read your resume word for word.  <A HREF="http://petdance.com/resume/">My own resume</A>, while tailored for the book publishers for whom I freelance, is a good example.  In the top 5 lines, you know what I am.
<P>
Here's what I want to know right away:
<UL>
<LI>How many years you've been programming
<LI>What you're most interested/proficient in
<LI>Skills that make me say "Oh, that would be cool to have in the department."
</UL>
Here's what I don't want to see right away: Irrelevant skills or experience that hides your talents.  I'm not looking for a FORTRAN programmer, so that FORTRAN, while potentially interesting, is not the first thing I want to see.  So many people drown the "signal" of their strengths in a sea of visual "noise".  Again, my resume lists those extra things, but the key things (Perl, Unix, etc) are bolded to stand out. 
<P><br/><br/>Once you get past that, you're halfway there.  Now, just don't commit these sins:<br/><br/><UL>
<LI><B>Put your name on everything.</B>
<BR>Just because it's in your resume, don't
neglect to put it in your cover letter and everything else you send me.<br/><br/><LI><B>Don't tell me about your money problems.</B>
<BR>Never discuss money in a resume or cover letter, unless it's specifically requested.  On a higher level, your money concerns are yours, not mine.<br/><br/><LI><B>Use the right terminology.</B>
<BR>When I see "Perl/Cgi" or "PERL", I know the writer either
<BR>A) doesn't really use Perl that much, 
<BR>B) doesn't pay attention to the printed word<br/><br/><LI><B>Back up your claims</B>
<BR>Don't just put "Perl" in your "Languages I know"
section, and then fail to include either on-the-job explanation below.
If you haven't used Perl on the job, then explain how you do know it.  I don't have any problem with "Wrote Foo::Bar and Mail::Glonko modules available on the CPAN."  What I don't want to see is only one occurrence of the string "Perl".<br/><br/><LI><B>Have a decent website</B>
<BR>If you have a website as a web programming professional, I expect
something a little bit better than something on geocities.  I'm no Jakob Nielsen, but at least it's my own domain.<br/><br/><LI><B>No typos.  None.</B>
<BR>Maybe in the cover email, but certainly not in an attached doc.<br/><br/><LI><B>Always include dates in your employment history.</B>
<BR>I won't be fooled that they're missing, and I'll wonder what you're hiding.<br/><br/><LI><B>Learn about what I need.</B>
<BR>Try to know something about what my company does.  I take my job and my company seriously, and I'd like you to, too.
</UL>
And, as always, I wholeheartedly recommend

            I won't be fooled that they're missing, and I'll wonder what you're
            hiding.</em>
<p>I'm curious why you prefer to have dates on the CV.</p>

I'm curious why you prefer to have dates on the CV.
</i>
<p>
Two reasons:
</p><ul>
<li>So I can see how long you've been doing what you're doing at the job.</li>  <li>So I have some idea how long you stay at your jobs.</li>
</ul>
Neither of those are criteria for hiring (for me), but they will lead into questions if there's an interview.  "I see you were at WidgetCo for only 4 months before you left for SpamInc.  Why is that?"  etc
