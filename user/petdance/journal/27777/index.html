Nice to see a healthy dose of Rush in there, but you still need a nice collection of Yes and ELP<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;) Failing that I would recommend listening to the last few albums by <a href="http://www.gep.co.uk/iq/" title="gep.co.uk">IQ</a gep.co.uk> (<i>Ever</i> being a particular favourite, which includes the 15+ minutes of <i>Further Away</i>).

I really don't dig the ELP, and Yes I've never really liked enough to buy anything beyond <i>Fragile</i>.

Ahh, memories of college radio and long breaks out on the balcony...or back in the days of vinyl, you could just find a record with an infinite loop at the end and let it play ad infinitum, or, if you really didn't care if you had listeners, you could play some <a href="http://www.rru.com/user/meo/music/mmm/" title="rru.com">Metal Machine Music</a rru.com> (the side with the infinite loop at the end)<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I got a lot of uninit warnings from your script, like the data could not be retrieved properly.  I dunno:<blockquote> <div><tt>Use of uninitialized value in printf at<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/private/var/tmp/folders.501/Cleanup At Startup/untitled text 13-154924196.547 line 40.<br>24:17 "" by&nbsp; from ""</tt></div> </blockquote>I wonder if maybe because it was not restricted to a specific media type(s)?<br><br>This is a lot more reliable and a lot faster for me (though also far less applicable for the article you're working on):<blockquote> <div><tt>#!/usr/bin/perl<br>
