Yeah, it was good, but I'm still working on the slides and the presentation.  Bill Odom has suggested I turn it into a screencast, which I may just do.

<p>
And, just to be weird with the locations, I'll be doing my project estimation and tracking talk for the Chicago PHP User Group: <a href="http://chiphpug.php.net/" title="php.net">http://chiphpug.php.net</a php.net></p>
