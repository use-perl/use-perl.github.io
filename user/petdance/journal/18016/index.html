<h1>A testing story with a happy ending</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>It all started easily enough.  There was a little note sent to the Perl
bug database:</p>
<pre>
    perlop man page mentions: Binary "x" is the repetition operator
    ... repeated the number of times specified by the right operand.</pre>
<pre>
    It should mention what about if the right operand is negative, e.g.,
    print '-' x -80</pre>
<p>I figured I could make a quick documentation fix, and maybe even add
some automated tests to the Perl test suite.</p>
<p>The <code>x</code> operator in Perl does repetition on a scalar or list, as
appropriate.  For example:</p>
<pre>
    $a = "abc" x 2;     # $a = "abcabc";
    @a = ("abc") x 2;   # @a = ("abc","abc");</pre>
<p>If the right-hand operator is 0, then you get an empty scalar or list,
as appropriate.  If the right-hand operator was negative, it was the
same effect as having it be zero.  As the bug said, the man page didn't
say anything about it.</p>
<p>I added a little sentence to the paragraph describing the operator, and
then I added some tests.  If it's worth documenting, it's worth testing.
Documentation and tests are as much a part of the code as the code itself.</p>
<p><em>t/op/repeat.t</em> already had a lot of tests in it, like:</p>
<pre>
    is('-' x 5, '-----',    'compile time x');
    is('-' x 1, '-',        '  x 1');
    is('-' x 0, '',         '  x 0');</pre>
<p>So I added the obvious add-ons:</p>
<pre>
    is('-' x -1, '',        '  x -1');
    is('-' x undef,'',      '  x undef');</pre>
<p>And then went to add them to the list-related sections:</p>
<pre>
    @x = qw( a b c );
    is(join('', (@x) x -14), '', '(@x) x -14');</pre>
<p>Before I sent the patch in, I ran a full <code>make test</code> and found that
the last test didn't pass.  In fact, it caused a Panic in Perl, and the
program died.  I boiled it down to a simple:</p>
<pre>
    perl -e'@x=(1);@y=(@x)x-1'</pre>
<p>Turns out that that case of a negative or zero operand wasn't handling the stack correctly (in the bleadperl only, fortunately).
A quick patch made it all better.</p>
<p>Some morals to this story:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a name="item_never_underestimate_the_power_of_one_little_test_2">Never underestimate the power of one little test.</a></strong><br />

<p>I want to get automated tests going in our shop, and I'd like to frame your points 1 and 2, and put them on the wall.</p>

Sure, go ahead.  Point #2 is in one of my presentations at
<a href="http://petdance.com/perl/" title="petdance.com">http://petdance.com/perl/</a petdance.com>.  I also made a slightly different version that was less code-intensive if that would help.
<p>
Heck, I'll come talk to your user group about testing, if you want...</p>

I can't agree more.  Testing is underappreciated in coding, as well as in system administration.  I've seen people do major upgrades without doing any testing afterwords.  ugh. (and if it's a good enough test to do after an upgrade, why isn't it automated and added to your Nagios configuration?)
<p>
Oh well.  I'm preaching to the converted.</p>

<p> <br> </p><ul><li>Hi Andy,</li></ul> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'll add a few (for what it's worth - after spending some time writing test code today) to the list (and a few q's)<br>btw I'm coming from a <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-unittest.html" title="python.org">python</a python.org> <br>testing pov so I'm curious how testing approachs differs for perl.  <br> <br>*<b>automate where possible</b> <br>-write automated test tools to generate test code stubs from source code<br>
&nbsp; to save time, effort and concentrate on thinking about tests.<br>*<b>make tests pass by default</b> <br>-lots of talk about failing code by default. the reverse is faster<br>
&nbsp; as reports are cleaner so it's easier to see if the current test your working on<br>
&nbsp; is ok.<br>*<b>test by intention</b> <br>-and then comment what the test is trying to acheive<br>-try reading old test code after many months and try to understand *why* you wrote it.<br>*<b>ship test code</b> <br>-I see this with most perl code anyway but it's worth including.<br> <br>what I would be interested to know is do you?<br> <br>*write the tests before writing the code?<br>-when do you write them?<br>-for me it's...  think about errors-&gt;code-&gt;auto-gen test-&gt;write testcode.<br>*average number of tests you have per module?<br> <br>



<h2>When to write tests?  How many?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2004-03-25T15:32:22</h3>
<i>
*write the tests before writing the code?
-when do you write them?
</i>
<p>
Short version:
</p><ol>
<li>Think about what the code should do.</li>
<li>Think about the API.</li>
<li>Write the documentation for the code, explaining what the parms do.</li>
<li>Write the test code that uses the API.</li>
<li>Keep doing #3 and #4 until all the cases are covered.  "Oooh, I hadn't thought of the case where a length is negative."  So you type in the docs "If the length passed is negative, then a warning is thrown," and then write the test that tests that.  Or vice versa.</li>
<li>Write the code.  You may go back to #3 and #4 as necessary because you think of more things as you write.</li>
<li>Check it into CVS.  Move on, knowing that you're covered.</li>
</ol>

<b>Tests and documentation are as much a part of the code as the code itself.</b>
<p>

<i>
*average number of tests you have per module?
</i>
</p><p>
As many as it takes to cover it.  As many as you need to get all the weird corner cases handled.  There's no way to put a number on it.
</p><p>
A test coverage tool like Devel::Cover can help make sure that you've exercised all your cases.</p>
