<div class="span8">
<p>I've uploaded the new 
<A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Harness/">Test::Harness</A>, version 2.32.  (Also available at
<A HREF="ftp://pause.cpan.org/pub/PAUSE/authors/id/P/PE/PETDANCE/Test-Harness-2.32.tar.gz">the PAUSE FTP site</A> if it's not updated yet on search.cpan.org)
<P>
Test::Harness now comes with a command-line utility called <I>prove</I> that runs tests against the harness.  
Why have a separate utility?  What's wrong with "make test"?
<p><em>prove</em> has a number of advantages over <code>make test</code> when doing development.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_prove_is_designed_as_a_development_tool"><em>prove</em> is designed as a development tool</a></strong><br />
</li>
Perl users typically run the test harness through a makefile via
<code>make test</code>.  That's fine for module distributions, but it's
suboptimal for a test/code/debug development cycle.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_prove_is_granular"><em>prove</em> is granular</a></strong><br />
</li>
<em>prove</em> lets your run against only the files you want to check.
Running <code>prove t/live/ t/master.t</code> checks every <em>*.t</em> in <em>t/live</em>,
plus <em>t/master.t</em>.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_prove_has_an_easy_verbose_mode"><em>prove</em> has an easy verbose mode</a></strong><br />
</li>
To get full test program output from <code>make test</code>, you must set
<code>HARNESS_VERBOSE</code> in the environment.  <em>prove</em> has a <code>-v</code> option.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_prove_can_run_under_taint_mode"><em>prove</em> can run under taint mode</a></strong><br />
</li>
<em>prove</em>'s <code>-T</code> runs your tests under <code>perl -T</code>.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_prove_can_shuffle_tests"><em>prove</em> can shuffle tests</a></strong><br />
</li>
You can use <em>prove</em>'s <code>--shuffle</code> option to try to excite problems
that don't show up when tests are run in the same order every time.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_not_everything_is_a_module">Not everything is a module</a></strong><br />
</li>
More and more users are using Perl's testing tools outside the
context of a module distribution, and may not even use a makefile
at all.
<p></p></ul>
<P>I welcome your comments and suggestions about <I>prove</I>, and I hope you find it as useful as I have over the past couple years of development.</p>

Only question, why <i>prove</i>?  I might have expected <i>runtests</i> or <i>testrun</i> or some such.  Too bad <i>test is taken.
</i><p><i>
-sam</i></p>

I knew I shoulda put a section called "Why prove?" in the docs.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>

First, <i>test</i> was right out, even if it wasn't already taken.  It's one of those words that when I see it as a file I assume is garbage, like <i>temp</i> or <i>foo</i>.

<i>runtests</i> is 8 characters, and it's two words.  I wanted a single word.

The program started as <i>smoke</i> at my day job, but <i>smoke</i> already has a meaning to Perl, or at least to the people who run the builds.
</p><p>
So I had to have a single word, and I convened an impromptu brainstorming session in AIM one day.  I don't remember who was in it: Piers Cawley, David Hand, Joe McMahon and Chris Nandor, at least.  We threw ideas around for about half an hour until someone suggest "prove".  Here's what Merriam-Webster says about prove:

</p><blockquote><div>
<b>1</b> <i>archaic</i><nobr> <wbr></nobr><b>:</b> to learn or find out by
experience<br> <b>2 a</b><nobr> <wbr></nobr><b>:</b> to test the truth, validity, or
genuineness of  &lt;the exception <i>proves </i>the rule&gt;
&lt;<i>prove</i> a will at probate&gt;
<br> <b>b</b><nobr> <wbr></nobr><b>:</b> to test the
worth or quality of; <i>specifically</i><nobr> <wbr></nobr><b>:</b> to compare against a
standard -- sometimes used with <i>up </i>or <i>out</i>
<br> <b>c</b><nobr> <wbr></nobr><b>:</b> to check the correctness of (as an arithmetic result)<br>
<b>3
a</b><nobr> <wbr></nobr><b>:</b> to establish the existence, truth, or validity of (as
by evidence or logic)  &lt;<i>prove</i> a theorem&gt;  &lt;the charges
were never <i>proved </i>in court&gt;
<br> <b>b</b><nobr> <wbr></nobr><b>:</b> to demonstrate
as having a particular quality or worth  &lt;the vaccine has been
<i>proven </i>effective after years of tests&gt;  &lt;<i>proved
</i>herself a great actress&gt;<br> <b>4</b><nobr> <wbr></nobr><b>:</b> to show (oneself)
to be worthy or capable  &lt;eager to <i>prove</i> myself in the new
job&gt;
</div></blockquote>
"To test the validity of", "to check the correctness of", "to show to be worth or capable": Sounds like what we're trying to do, right?  There's also the idea of a "proving grounds" that ties in with those.
<p>
And it's only 5 characters and easy to type, which is key.</p>

Heh. <i>taken</i> would be a great name.<br> <br>"Why is it called <i>taken</i>?"<br>"Because <i>test</i> is <i>taken</i>."<br>





</blockquote>


<h2>Allow some pre-test code?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cbrandtbuffalo/">cbrandtbuffalo</a> on 2003-11-09T19:32:19</h3>
We often need to pass environment variables to our tests to simulate a particular run environment. We also tend to have logic wrapped around these variables to set parameters for sandbox testing, QA testing, etc.<br> <br><br/><br/>Would it be possible to pass something into prove to make it run some pre-test code? If given a certain flag, maybe have it look for a default config-type file in the current directory and require it before running?<br> <br><br/><br/>Just a thought...thanks for the new tool!



<h2>'prove' is useful</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/markjugg/">markjugg</a> on 2003-11-12T17:53:40</h3>
I've already found this useful. using "make test", it was hard to remember the syntax to run just some particular tests and be verbose about something. This made it easy to re-test a particular script for DBD::Pg:
<p>
<code>
prove -v  -Iblib/lib -Iblib/arch t/01setup.t t/15table_attrs.t t/99cleanup.t
</code>
</p>

<h2>Re:'prove' is useful</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2003-11-18T19:07:51</h3>
And this is now easier as<blockquote><div> <tt>prove -v -b t/01setup.t t/15table_attrs.t t/99cleanup.t</tt> </div></blockquote>
