<p><p>Microsoft is running the 3rd annual Scripting Games competition, and this year they added a Perl division alongside VBScript and Windows
PowerShell:
  <p><URL:http://www.microsoft.com/technet/scriptcenter/funzone/games/default.mspx>

<p>The games have already begun on Friday, but the deadline for the first 2 events isn't until Wednesday morning, so it is not too late to enter and get a perfect score!

<p>All Perl entries will be judged by running them with ActivePerl 5.10.0.1002, so you can start using all the new 5.10 features if you want.

<p>The competitors pack is a self-extracting ZIP file containing additional data files needed for some challenges. It is provided as an .exe file
(probably so it could be digitally signed), but you can unpack it with normal "unzip" too (this is just a subtle hint that the actual challenges are not platform specific; you just need to remember to prefix the path to any of the data files with <code>C:/Scripts/</code> before you
submit your scripts).

<p>I'll be providing sample solutions and a running commentary for the Advanced Perl Division to the scripting guys at Microsoft, who will
publish them from each events page after the deadline. They should also become linked from here:

<p><URL:http://www.microsoft.com/technet/scriptcenter/funzone/games/games08/experts.mspx>

<p>So let's show them that there are a sufficient number of Perl users that it is worthwhile keeping a Perl division in the Scripting Games for the
upcoming years! :)

<p>BTW, you also have a chance to win a Perl Dev Kit license if you enter the contest for at least a single event!
