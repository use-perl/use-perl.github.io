<p>This <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/31084.html">article</a> certainly raises an interesting piont of view on the recent rise in mailer-daemon spam I have been getting</p>

Are the bounce messages you get mostly for russian spams? If so, that's a spammer who has picked a bunch of perl hackers for the "from" address.<br> <br>It's not an attempted way to deliver spam.<br> <br>Though I do think MTA's should stop including the full body of the message in NDRs.



<h2>Um, me too?</h2>

I was wondering about that because I got a couple of really weird bounces this weekend, and the only reason I found them was that I had to filter through all the bounces for the stuff TPR sent out on friday. (About 15% of the email addresses go bad after 3 months).<br> <br>I've since erased all that stuff, but they all had a phone number to call and didn't say anything about who or what I was calling. It didn't look like the usual abuse of my @cpan.org address. It didn't look like it had anything to do with russians as far as I could tell.<br> <br>But, does it get confusing to have a Matt Sergeant and a Matt Sargeant working at the same place? Did the Register really interview both of them?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
