<p>Well unfortunately some of us don't have a choice. For the past
couple of months I have had an iBook on loan from Apple, for which
I am very grateful. It has been a great experience, but it will
not be long before I must learn to live without it.
<p>
For many years I have used either KDE or Gnome as my desktop
environment, but when I have had to use a windows box, it has not
bothered me much. By that I mean that the change in UI has not
bothered me much, having to use Windows has always bothered me :)
<p>
My work habits cause me to work from a laptop for several hours of
the day, so recently I have been using the iBook instead of my
win2k laptop.
<p>
The other day I had to power up my win2k laptop for the first time
since I got the iBook. My first response was "Argh, this is painful!!". 
I just found the UI difficult.
<p>
In fact now that I think of it, since I have had the iBook I have
been getting a little frustrated with KDE and Gnome at times, but
they have been only minor frustrations and often overcome by the
fact that I can configure them to do things how I want. Windows
is not so forgiving.
<p>
Anyway, I guess my point is that although I did not take to the
Apple desktop at first, it has grown on me very quickly in a very
short time. There are many things about the iBook I just thought
I would never get used to, like only one mouse button, but I did.
I still have some frustrations with it, but as the iBook I have is
a loaner, it is running Mac OS X 10.1 and I have been told many
issues I have with it are resolved in 10.2.
<p>
So soon I have to send the iBook back, and yes I will miss it.
Right now I am in the middle of moving house, so I don't have any
spare finances. But you can be sure once I have moved and sorted
my finances, I will be buying a Mac
