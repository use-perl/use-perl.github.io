<p>Why is it that some people think they have a birth right to be helped, however hard they make it for you to help them. 
Most people are happy for whatever help you can give them. But occasionally you get someone who sends the briefest description then takes offense when your response does not fix their problem. Take a read of this email

 Neither am I because the details you give me are nothing. You give
 nothing then there is nothing I can return.

OK, maybe I was a bit blunt in my first reply, but he then followed this with a long essay, which I just ignored.
<p>
Then today, over a month later, I get
<P><ECODE>
"Neither am I"? Are you sure you didn't mean "So am I"?

Do i  need to write you another fucking 50 page guide on how to
communicate online for those who never learnt to communicate offline?

</ECODE><p>
Which is nothing more than an attack on me and only served to get him added to a blacklist.
<p>
Why do people shoot themselves in the foot by directly attacking the same person they are trying to ask for help?</p>

<p>Make up a special auto-reply just for that guy, including something like:

</p><p><blockquote><div> <tt>Dear sir/madam,

</tt><p><tt>Your e-mail address has been blocked for usage of improper language: "Do i  need to write you another f****** 50 page [...]".

</tt></p><p><tt>Your e-mail address will remain blocked until you learn how to behave yourself.

</tt></p> </div></blockquote>
<p>Of course this could pose one problem... the guy would probably try to contact you via some other address...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-|</p>
