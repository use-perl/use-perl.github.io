<p>I try not to regret too many things in life, other than things I didn't do. But there are times when you look back and have to regret doing something. This is a situation I find myself in now.
<p>
I have never written a book before, so I did not really know what to expect. But I was convinced by a previous author, offering guidance and direction, to sign up as a co-author with them for my idea of a book on Net::LDAP. As they had previously published a book with AW we signed up with AW. Our contact at AW was very understanding of me being a new author, was very helpful and offered some good advice.
<p>
That was last year. Since then our AW contact has changed and our new contact does not seem to be quite so helpful. To add to that I rarely hear from my co-author, in fact the only thing I have heard in the last few months is <cite>"How are you doing, how much time have you had?"</cite>
<p>
So I will place this in the box of one of life lessons, but I do regret it as I now feel the book will never happen.</p>
