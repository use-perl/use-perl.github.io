<p><p>
The Perl Foundation took part in Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of Code</a> program and managed to get <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/news/2005/googlesoc2.html">8 projects funded</a>. As the projects were starting, I 
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme/journal/25874">interviewed the students</a> to see what their plans were. Now that the summer is over,
I'm interviewing both the students and their mentors as a project postmortem. What happened? What went right? What went wrong?
</p>
<p>
Ahoy matey! It's <a href="http://www.yarr.org.uk/talk/">Talk Like a Pirate Day</a>, so
up now is <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme/journal/25881">Refactor Pirate so that the intermediate code emitter is independent of the Python parse tree (AST)</a>, by Curtis Hall with mentor Michal Wallace. First up is the mentor, then the student.
</p>

<b>Hi there! Tell us a bit about yourself.                                                    </b><br/>
<p>
I'm 29, live in Atlanta, and run a little web hosting
company called <a href="http://www.cornerhost.com/">cornerhost</a>.
</p>
<b>What qualifies you to be the mentor for this project?                                      </b><br/>
<p>
I did some of the earliest work on pirate. Other
people (mostly Sam Ruby) have since made a lot of
improvements but the overall structure of the code
never really changed. So basically I was the guy
that created the mess Curt was cleaning up. :)
</p>
<b>How did you communicate with the student during the project? What you communicate about?   </b><br/>
<p>
We met up several times early on via AIM and
shared a terminal session through the magic of
the GNU screen program. We mostly worked through
the old design and the problems it had, as well
as how we wanted things to look, and then figured
out how to make the transition.

Once Curt was on a roll, we mostly just checked
in periodically over AIM or email.                                
</p>
<b>What is the state of the project? Where is it available?                                   </b><br/>
<p>
Curt has completed most of the refactoring. Last
I heard there were still a few failing tests that
he was cleaning up. It should be available for
download via the web or cvs soon. Check the 
<a href="http://pirate.tangentcode.com/">pirate site</a> for updates.
</p>
<b>Did you learn anything that surprised you?                                                 </b><br/>
<p>
I'm looking to expand my company a bit, and have
never really dealt with a multi-person project
from the management side. So working with Curt was
really interesting from that point of view. I'm hoping
he'll stick around to do some work for my
company. :)
</p>
<b>Where is the project going to go now that the summer is over?                              </b><br/>
<p>
Well, the goal of refactoring pirate was to make the
code flexible enough so that other languages can use
it. So part of the next step will be comparing notes
with the other compiler writers (like the pugs team)
and seeing how we can work together.

Another big part will be making pirate self hosting.
In other words, we need to get pirate running on
parrot so that it can load and compile code at
runtime.
</p>
<b>What, if anything, would you change about the SoC next year?                               </b><br/>
<p>
I think it would have been fun to have a little more
communication between the other participants. I only
just now found out there was a mailing list list for
the whole summer of code project. Doesn't look like too
many people posted once things were underway. It might
be fun to encourage people to post on their progess
next time around, either through the list or with
blogs or whatever.
</p>
<b>Got a silly fact about yourself or the project?                                            </b><br/>
<p>
I was born without an E in my first name... :)
</p>

<b>Now back to the student. Hello again! Did you have a good summer?              </b><br/>
<p>
Yes I did, was pretty busy with the project, but had a little time to relax.
</p>
<b>Did the project go as expected?                                                </b><br/>
<p>
Yes it did. It went very well. I learned so much more than I had expected.
</p>
<b>Did you learn anything that surprised you?                                     </b><br/>
<p>
Well, I learned about real world refactoring and coding, and the different
utilities and tools you need to make a project like this work.
</p>
<b>What's the status of the project? Where is it available?                       </b><br/>
<p>
It's in the final stages of cleanup right now. Newer revisions will be updated
at <a href="http://pirate.tangentcode.com/">pirate.tangentcode.com</a>.
</p>
<b>Where is the project going to go now that the summer is over?                  </b><br/>
<p>
It's going to get cleaned up and hopefully used in my next project, to
port Icon
to the Parrot VM.
</p>
<b>What kind of help did you get from your mentor?                                </b><br/>
<p>
Guidance and roadmaps to show me where to begin and how to keep track of what
I'm doing. My mentor helped with answering technical questions that I didn't
know.
</p>
<b>If you were going to do this again next year, what would you do differently?   </b><br/>
<p>
Set short term goals and stick to them instead of offshooting to tangents and
parts of the same project.
