<p>OK, so I haven't been underwater for the whole of the past six weeks - for at least some of it I was on dry land. I even managed to <a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/?search=fort%20lauderdale">take some pictures</a>. Somehow I managed to catch up on email, play with Ajax, and do some module releases.
<p>
I released <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-DAV-Server/">Net::DAV::Server</a> 1.24, which included a big patch from Mark A. Hershberger and is slightly further along the way to  handling the WebDAV standard. There's still some way to go, but more people seem interested in WebDAV thesedays (*cough* <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">livejournal</a> *cough*).
<p>
I also released <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-DPAP-Client/">Net::DPAP::Client</a> 0.25, which now works with iPhoto 5 (thanks to Jack/ms419). Oops, how did I not patch that before...
<p>
Also, I've been toying with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Catalyst/">Catalyst</a>, yet another MVC web application framework which does seem quite elegant. However, I can't play with something without a proper test suite, so I created <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-WWW-Mechanize-Catalyst/">Test::WWW::Mechanize::Catalyst</a>,  which meshes Catalyst with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-WWW-Mechanize/">Test::WWW::Mechanize</a> to help test Catalyst applications. Now we have testing, I can properly play with it. It does seem quite neat (the software that runs <a href="http://www.astray.com/">www.astray.com</a> is fairly similar in concept, but a bit messier), and it appears to have gained the mindset of a few interesting people. I'm sure we'll discuss it in depth at <a href="http://yapc.elixus.org/english/">YAPC::Taipei</a>.
<p>
I *am* looking forward to Taipei, but I have a few days of crazy travelling and jetlag before that. More importantly, we get to celebrate ingy's birthday! There may be dancing. And orange. Fear!</p>
