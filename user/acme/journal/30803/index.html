Yesterday evening I travelled up to Birmingham with Ranguard and Tatsuhiko. We thought we were on the same train as Fotango people, but they must be ghosts because we didn't see them at all. The Virgin trains were actually pretty impressive; vaguely clean and with power sockets. We made it to the conference hotel, which is pretty good apart from the stupid wireless costs (5 pounds an hour!).
</p>
<p>
We met up with gellyfish and a few mongers and wandered down the canal to a bar were we could register for the conference, drink a few beers and meet up with everyone. It's nice to meet the old hands and also meet new people.
</p>
<p>
This morning was fun. The conference venue is very close to the hotel and is wonderfully organised. Thanks all! Larry gave a great talk about everything and Ovid gave a good introduction to what TPF does. I'm now typing in <a href="http://www.birmingham2006.com/cgi-bin/yapc.pl?act=talk-item&talkid=68">How to Join the Perl Community</a> by JosÃÂ© Castro.
Now what shall I hack upon? Let the conference begin!
</p></p>

<p>I think they were also offering &#163;10 a day. Although I suspect I could expense it, I figure I'll take the economic disinsentive as a hint to socialise more. [hmmm, so can I expense that...]</p>

You could try to drink &#163;5 of beer/hr, although, given current &#163;/$ exchange rates, that the &#163;10 daily could get you a long ways on imported American beer.
