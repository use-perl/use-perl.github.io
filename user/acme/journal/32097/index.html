<p>I'm confused about video projectors. LCD TVs have got bigger and brighter and cheaper in the last few years, but video projectors just aren't cheap yet. How come they haven't become more like a commodity?<br/><br/>P.S. Happy new year!</p>

<h2>Lamp and tiny screen</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Juerd/">Juerd</a> on 2007-01-08T12:51:22</h3>
There are two expensive parts in an LCD video projector. The lamp, and the tiny screen. People want resolutions of at least 1024x768, but don't forget that this has to fit in a small enclosure. These screens are much smaller than laptop screens.<br><br>High DPI is still more expensive than normal DPI, but that doesn't mean they didn't get any cheaper. Prices dropped as much as 50% the past few years.<br><br>If you want a home projector for watching videos, consider getting a cheap DLP based one. DLP is cheap, compared to LCD, and produces a higher contrast. Don't use that for presentations, though, because the refresh rate (caused by a rapid rotator) makes it unpleasant for some people to watch stills.
