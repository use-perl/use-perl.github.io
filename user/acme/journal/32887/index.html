<p>Google's <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/sawzall.html">Sawzall paper</a> mentions "protocol buffers":
<blockquote>
Although originally conceived for de&#64257;ning the messages communicated between servers, GoogleÃ¢â¬â¢s
protocol buffers are also used to describe the format of permanent records stored on disk. They
serve a purpose similar to XML, but have a much denser, binary representation, which is in turn
often wrapped by an additional compression layer for even greater density.
</blockquote>
... which always intrigued me. Facebook has just released <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/thrift/">Thrift</a>, 
which appears to fill the same niche: "a software framework for scalable cross-language services development. It combines a powerful software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between C++, Java, Python, PHP, and Ruby". From the interesting <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/thrift/thrift-20070401.pdf">whitepaper</a>:
<blockquote>
Thrift is a software library and set of code-generation tools developed at Facebook to expedite development and implementation of
ef&#64257;cient and scalable backend services. Its primary goal is to enable ef&#64257;cient and reliable communication across programming languages by abstracting the portions of each language that tend to
require the most customization into a common library that is implemented in each language. Speci&#64257;cally, Thrift allows developers
to de&#64257;ne data types and service interfaces in a single language-neutral &#64257;le and generate all the necessary code to build RPC clients
and servers.
</blockquote>
Now who wants to add Perl support?

<h2>protocols were born to be free</h2>

Sounds a lot like what we used for our backend work in my previous job. Nice to see companies opening up a little. I shudder to think of the number of hours wasted reverse engineering the aim protocol when a simple language independent description is available  to those on the inside.
