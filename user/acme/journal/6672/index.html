<p>Well, it's all very sad. It's the last day of TPC and, sniff, after this it's all over. It started off with a crap keynote by some Java people who told us what we already knew but very badly and a guy walking through the special effects in Lord of the Rings (apparently they use a lot of Perl!) which was very cool indeed. His talk was mostly video and whereas yesterday I wanted to go and work for bioinformatics, today I want to go and work in special effects! 
<p>
Today is Parrot day, with Dan and I talking about Parrot from the big picture to assembler to Targeting Parrot (my talk! just over!) and Parrot extensions. I've been doing a lot of speaking to people about Parrot recently and it seems many are interested. Quite a few Perl gods a here and with any luck I haven't made a fool of myself. Anyway, hopefully we'll get some more hackers on perl6-internals...
<p>
There's a town hall meeting to come and then lots and lots of drinking. Real beer and tequila, oh yes...</p>
