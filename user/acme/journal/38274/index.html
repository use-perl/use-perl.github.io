<p>I'm pleased to announce the next Perl 6 Microgrant is to <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Whiteknight/journal">Andrew Whitworth</a> for the purposes of writing a book about the Perl 6
programming language on <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikibooks</a>, a Wikimedia Foundation project.
<blockquote>
<p>
This book project will entail a number of important aspects, and its
success will be determined by them:
</p>
<p>
1) Writing the bulk of the content, which will be derived not only
from the various Synopses, but the official test suite and directly
from the active developers. Information which is speculative (such as
from non-finalized synopses) may be included but will not be the focus
of initial effort due to their unstable nature. A successful book will
include the information and examples necessary to teach the core
language to a person who is not currently familiar with it, and bring
that person up to a basic level of understanding.
</p>
<p>
2) Aggregating and integrating existing Perl 6 documentation which is
licensed compatibly with Wikibooks, or for which the authors agree to
grant a license for the use of their work at Wikibooks. While not a
metric for the success of this project, being able to include a
comprehensive listing of related resources and obtain small donations
of content will help to make the book viable and to get a larger
community involved.
</p>
<p>
3) Attracting readership and additional authors/editors/contributors
to the book to ensure it remains viable in the long-term as an
authoritative Perl 6 resource.  Success in this is harder to gauge or
estimate, but the net result should be that more readers are exposed
to Perl 6 and able to learn it on their own, and that more volunteers
are attracted to the Perl 6 project to aide in documentation and book
writing.
</p>
</blockquote>


Good luck Andrew! If you're interested in submitting a Perl 6 microgrant, you can at <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=07/03/22/1542235">find more information about how to do so</a>.</p>
