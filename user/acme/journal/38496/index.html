<p>          <div class="asset-body preview-links"> <p>Hi there porters,
</p><p>
Perl 5.005 is a great version of Perl and still used by many people. There have been a few distribution updates and tool changes which mean that it no longer compiles cleanly everywhere, so I believe it&#39;s time for another maintenance release of perl5.005, which will lead to perl5.005_05.
</p><p>
Please compile and make test this release candidate on as many platforms as possible:
</p><p>
 &#160;<a href="http://acme.s3.amazonaws.com/perl/perl5.005_05-RC1.tar.gz" target="_blank">http://acme.s3.amazonaws.com/perl/perl5.005_05-RC1.tar.gz</a>
</p><p>
This is a release candidate. I&#39;m interested in compilation fixes. I&#39;m not interested in fixing warnings.

</p><p>
It is hosted on the Perl 5 Git repository:
</p><p>
 &#160;<a href="http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/log/refs/heads/maint-5.005" target="_blank">http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/log/refs/heads/maint-5.005</a>
</p><p>
Which means you can see the Changes file here:
</p><p>
 &#160;<a href="http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/blob_plain/ba3f100:/Changes" target="_blank">http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/blob_plain/ba3f100:/Changes</a>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2009-02-17T04:26:44</h3>
<p>Far be it from me to tell anyone what to do in his or her copious free time, but the one thing you <em>can't</em> say about people who haven't upgraded Perl in just shy of nine years is that they're on the edge of their seats, waiting to upgrade to a new version of Perl.</p>

Every so often people complain to me that it doesn't compile any more. The reasons are known and can be fixed easily, hence this release.

<blockquote><div><p> <em>Every so often people complain to me that it doesn't compile any more.</em></p></div> </blockquote><p>Again, I'm not interested in telling you what to do for fun, but doesn't at least one of the thirteen subsequent stable releases compile for them?  Perhaps one released this millennium?</p>

But I'm sure they have their reasons for wanting that one.* "There's nowt as queer as folks".</p><p> <small>* I had good reason for wanting 5.004_<b>04</b> to work on a modern Linux in 2001. Reasons exist.</small> </p>

<h2>Re:Why?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chorny/">chorny</a> on 2009-02-17T10:33:38</h3>
<p>I tried to run 5.5 and 5.4 with CPAN::Reporter (was not successful with 5.4, but several bugs in modules where fixed). Reason was to help people understand that if they use one feature from newer Perl, their CPAN distribution already does not work on older Perl's and they can use all features - too many CPAN distributions try to be compatible with old Perl, but in reality they are not.</p>
