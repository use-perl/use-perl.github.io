<p>I'm scared. I'm not often scared.<br/><br/>I have snowboarded. I have dived. Heck, I've even combined the two and gone ice diving (ask me about it sometime). I've given presentations in front of hundreds of people. But I'm now scared.<br/><br/>My god-daughter is coming to stay with me. She is French, 9 years old, and very cute. Her parents are staying in a hotel and she is staying with me. For the weekend. And I don't know her very well. Panic!<br/><br/>Yes, I've bought lots of Christmas presents and games. Yes, I have lunch and dinners planned out. What if she gets bored of me? What if it rains and we have to stay in? What if she burns the place down? What if she doesn't understand my French?<br/><br/><i>I'm scared...</i></p>

Simple : hot milk with a touch of vodka<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<br>
<br>But, more seriously, keep kids busy and they tend to enojoy themselves.  Have a list of busy things for them to do, and when they get bored, shuffle them along to another busy thing to do.

Is her name Mathilda? You could teach her to become a cleaner<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>Well, someone would have to teach her how to waltz too. I'll bet Leon would look pretty smart in a little maid outfit though and it's sure to amuse the little girl.</p>

<p>I've rented the nieces and nephews for a few days before and survived.  Take her to the Museum of London and maybe the Albert and Victoria. I don't see how she could possibly be bored in London. I'm sure she'll like you...just don't take her to a London.pm meeting<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
