<p>Since winning the Tanaka Business School <a href="https://www3.imperial.ac.uk/portal/page?_pageid=69,354585&_dad=portallive&_schema=PORTALLIVE&newsid=294">Ideas Challenge</a> in December with my sister, I've been thinking about applying for an MBA. I definitely only want to study for one year, rather than two. It shouldn't really be suprising, but the most interesting source of information I've found is <a href="http://mbaleague.blogspot.com/">blogs</a>, for example <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0110351/">Un Film Snob Pour Martiens</a> and <a href="http://brit-chickmba.blogspot.com/2004_03_01_brit-chickmba_archive.html">Brit-Chick MBA</a>. Overall it seems like a lot of work and possibly quite rewarding. A good start for AcmeCorp?</p>

<h2>What do you want out of an MBA Program?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2005-01-12T03:10:34</h3>
There are many reasons to get an MBA.  Many of them are bad.  Many MBA programs are bad.  In the US, the bulk of them are geared to giving students a very expensive yet meaningless faux certification that makes it easier to get a middle management job at a somewhat higher salary.  For these programs, Business Administration is just a name, and has virtually nothing to do with the curriculum.
<p>
Some MBA programs here (Harvard, Wharton) are geared for training and/or grooming the executive ranks in big business.  A good deal of Wharton grads, for example, don't care at all about the curriculum -- they're there for the networking opportunities five and ten years hence.  Some employers hire Wharton grads by the dozen because of the prestige, intimidation and networking opportunities they bring.
</p><p>
Some MBA programs, like Stern at NYU, are actually about learning the what it takes to run a business successfully.  Part of the curriculum is writing a business plan and building that business before you graduate.  There graduation rate is noticably lower than other top schools, because many students drop out to run their businesses full time.
</p><p>
Other programs, like UCLA (?), recognize that the true purpose of an MBA is networking, so the course work focuses a lot on team building and group activities.  Other programs focus on a set of skills; I worked with a Babson MBA once who talked about how the Babson curriculum focuses on cultivating a sense of entrepreneurship.
</p><p>
So, what do you want to get out of an MBA program?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>
