<p>Well, I got to try out Acme::Colour in real life this weekend. I got my new flat and decided to paint it. Stealing little bits of tester paper from the paint shop I decided to paint my bedroom Orange (of course), my coridoor Portugese Blue, and my living room Arctic Storm Grey. Acme::Colour starts with white and then tints the colour by adding variours tints, and that's exactly what they did at the paint store. They typed in a colour code into a machine, put in some white matt paint, and it added some red, blue, and black and then mixed it all together. I had no idea I would see a real application of it so soon!
<p>
I learnt how to cook tonkatsu, which was nice. Someone in the course didn't eat pork, so they used beef instead, which was very very nice indeed. Mmmmm.
<p>
I've been toying with permissions at work, and having stolen ideas from the java.security.Permission module I'm playing with a dead simple Permission module, which permits actions on a resource (or not). abw is simplifying it and then I need to think of a good name for it. I don't think I can create a top-level CPAN namespace every week. Andreas might get angry ;-)
