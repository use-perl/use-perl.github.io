Whoopsie, haven't blogged since <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/oscon2005/">OSCON</a>, which was fun. I stayed around in San Francisco for a bit (wow, those hills are steep. also <a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/default.asp">In-N-Out</a> is tasty) and I'm now back in sunny London. I was actually interviewing for a few positions around San Francisco but my timing is off: USCIS have <a href="http://uscis.gov/graphics/publicaffairs/newsrels/H-1Bcap_12Aug05.pdf">announced</a> (PDF) that there are no more H1Bs (the "tech visa") left for the coming 14 months, which is sucky. Dear all countries of the world: people who come to work for you or visit you are good for your economy, please start thinking more long-term.
</p>
<p>
I quite liked OSCON. I enjoy meeting people and seeing what everyone is up to. Thesedays, I'm more interested in the enterprise track: more hits, more data. Things you should be using: <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> (with InnoDB and constraints, replicate down for reads and partition data if you must), <a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/">memcached</a>  (fast, simple caching is all you need, trust me), <a href="http://www.danga.com/mogilefs/">mogilefs</a> (don't spend $$$ or implement your own distributed file system or I'll hit you), Perl (well, <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> really - dependencies are your friend), <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">apache</a> (nothing better yet), <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/">xen</a> (I hate hardware, so virtualise it all so you can have no scheduled downtime), <a href="http://svk.elixus.org/">svk</a> (for development - even if you don't need the neat distributed stuff, it's faster and uses less space than the svn client). Got any tips?
</p>
<p>
I'm really looking forward to <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/">YAPC::Europe</a> in Portugal in a week and a bit (arrgggh, slides!) and then <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/eurooscon/">Euroscon</a>.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of Code</a> is coming to a close (note to Google: having that not updated isn't very professional). I wonder how the projects are going, and how organisations/mentors get to decide if the project is finished (and the student gets their $$$$).
</p>
<p>
Also, I'm sick of people writing frameworks. Something I stressed in my interviews is that I'm all about getting things actually done. Spending six months writing a framework with no idea of what it'll actually be doing isn't my cup of tea: I'll do the project instead and ship it. Only if I do three or more things which share some similar code will I actually consider writing a framework. Frameworks all the way down is lunacy, and I recognise it in too many companies. Get it done instead! ;-)
</p>
<p>
So back to square one. Anyone want a cool Perl hacker in London?

Sorry to hear that, Leon.  I was looking forward to seeing you more in the US.  Guess I'll just have to go to London more.

<p>Amen. People building for reuse before there are a waste of space. Rip your frameworks out of your products, don't try and guess what you're going to be doing in six months time.</p>
