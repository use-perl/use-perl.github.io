<p>For the past couple of days, I've been in lovely sunny Portugal. I was
a speaker at <a href="http://www.di.uminho.pt/join2003/">JOIN2003</a>,
a technical conference at the University of Minho at Braga.

<p>

Speaking before me was <a
href="http://research.microsoft.com/Users/simonpj/">Simon Peyton
Jones</a>, Haskell guru extraordinaire. The university teaches Haskell
in the first year and lots of the students are complete
Haskell-heads. Luckily I found out that they teach Perl in the last
year (for the natural language processing course), but I was
constantly joking that Perl was more, well, practical.

<p>

Simon gave a retrospective on Haskell, noting what he thought were
particular good and bad moves for the language in the past. I haven't
really done much Haskell since university so it was a great recap - I
even understood what monads are about. I particularly like his view
that the major problem with monads was the name, which just scares
people off. Also, he suggested that being lazy by default was a
problem (for performance: most functional programs can work just fine
without laziness for 90% of the time), and that Haskell2 (or whatever)
should be lazy just on programmer demand. I noticed a lot of
similarities between Haskell and Perl 6, which I think should be
interesting.

<p>

I then presented my "Little languages in Parrot talk", putting in a
little bit more about the history of Parrot and Perl 6 than I normally
do. I rattled the talk of pretty quickly as we were a little behind
the schedule. It was fun being back at university again, but it was
annoying how few questions the students asked. Howerver, I think
overall my talk was successful as I have inspired a few people to
investigate Befunge.

<p>

Speaking after me was <a href="http://www.dedasys.com/davidw/">David
Welton</a>, who explained how he built Rivet, a PHP-alike using Tcl and
Apache. There were, of course, many other talks afterwards, some of
which abused Powerpoint in horrible ways. In particular "Oracle and
Very Large DataBases" was presented by a marketing droid and very
boring. Some of the student talks were quite interesting however.

<p>

In the evenings there were a couple of fun events. One was a
Counterstrike tournament, originally Staff versus Students but the
Staff chickened out. I was a judge in a programming competition, with
students having to write UNIX filters for a variety of problems in a
short time using whatever language they chose. Many chose Haskell, but
the Perl people showed off a little bit too. Some even chose to
program C, but mostly spent the whole time fixing off-by-one errors
and segfaults. Haskell won two out of three, with a particularly cute
C program which called main() recursively winning the code style
award. There was also an event where you had to find answers to a
series of questions using the web, where I managed to scare everyone
by correctly guessing the 300th digit of pi.

<p>

Throughout the conference, the organisers (Magda and Alberto) took
great care of me, taking me out on the town and showing me Porto. I
didn't know Portugal very well, but found it all very laid back and
the food here is great. I also tested my theory that Chinese food is
different around the world and succeeded by having some decidedly
weird deep-fried ice cream.

<p>
Overall it was great fun and a wonderful conference to start my Perl
Conference World Tour with. I shall leave you with the wisdom from one
of the JOIN adverts:

<h2>Haskell?!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/educated_foo/">educated_foo</a> on 2003-06-08T14:45:26</h3>
Wow.  The anecdotes I've read have all seemed to point to Haskell's being hard as a first language, so I'm surprised the students chose it freely for random coding tasks.  What kind of Haskell environment did they use?  What other languages had they seen (and in what order)?  Did you get a sense for what portion of the students "got it"?<p>/s</p>

Hi! I'm the Alberto guy!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
Here in the university, programming languages are presented in this order (this will change a little sooner or later): Haskell, C, Prolog, Java
Other languages are used but under other subjects: Perl for system admins and natural language processing, Visual Basic (yuck!) for some database applications, and so on.
</p><p>
Regarding the use of Haskell and not another language, teachers noticed that students which already program (C, for example) have more dificulties to learn Haskell than the virgin ones<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

This makes sense to me.  I started out with Scheme, then C++, and it took me awhile to be able to write idiomatic Haskell.  I'm still not comfortable in Prolog, but since I don't really have a use for it, that's not such a big deal.<p>
I'm impressed by the language variety there, btw.  Where I am now (UCSD), they throw the students right into Java, then have them pick up a bit of C/asm for compilers and OS.  While the PL course here is sometimes taught in Haskell, it's optional, and most students don't take it (a shame).  Most of the upper-level undergrads I've dealt with don't have a strong grasp of programming language semantics.  So I find it surprising that a curriculum showing all three major programming paradigms succeeds (if it does) with more than a small minority of the students.  Haskell's never struck me as particularly forgiving, either -- some of the type errors it gives are (to me) less than transparent.

<h2>Not the 300th digit</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ambs/">ambs</a> on 2003-06-09T10:16:09</h3>
But the 400th digit! In fact, Leon pointed that the 400th digit of Pi is a 4. In fact, the 400th decimal digit of Pi is a 4. The real 400th digit (counting the 3) is a 9 (I think!)



<h2>Befunge</h2>

&gt; Howerver, I think overall my talk was successful as I have inspired a few people to investigate Befunge.<br>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>Niark, niark! Seems that my plan for world domination works!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-&gt;
