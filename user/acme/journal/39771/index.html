<p>            <div class="asset-body preview-links"> <p>A few weeks ago I was up in the hills about Geneva reminiscing with my sister about all the things we used to enjoy when we were smaller. When I was younger I used to really enjoy programming computer games, first on my 48K Spectrum and then later on in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOS_BASIC">STOS BASIC</a> and then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68000">68000</a> assembly language on my Atari ST.</p><p>I haven&#39;t programmed a game in a very long time. However, I&#39;m an avid gamer, playing games while travelling on my DS and at home on my Xbox 360. I almost enjoy reading <a href="http://www.edge-online.com/">Edge magazine</a> more than I like playing games.</p><p>At YAPC::Europe in Lisbon, Domm pointed out that the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/SDL_Perl/">Perl SDL project</a> (which wraps the <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">Simple DirectMedia Layer</a>) was languishing and that we should all programs games in Perl.</p><p>A few months later I got around to playing with SDL and made a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_clones">breakout clone</a> which I styled after <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0000472">Batty</a> on the Spectrum, but with gravity. It was fairly easy to program, but there was a lot to grasp. The Perl libraries are a mix between a Perl interface to SDL and a Perlish interface to SDL, with limited documentation, tests and examples.</p><p>Of course this is where I join the #sdl IRC channel on irc.perl.org and start discussing with the other hackers (kthakore, garu, nothingmuch). We decide on a major redesign to split the project into two sections: the main code will just wrap SDL and then there will be another layer which makes it easier to use. I&#39;ve started writing a bunch of XS on the <a href="http://github.com/kthakore/SDL_perl/tree/redesign">redesign branch</a> of the repository while trying to keep <a href="http://github.com/acme/bouncy">Bouncy (my game)</a> still working. There is a bunch of work still to do but we&#39;ve made a good start. This is what Bouncy looks like at the moment:<br />

The physics are pretty fun and it runs pretty fast (1800 frames/second). I'm taking a little break as I'm off to Taipei...

<p>You know, with a share/ and script/ directory, and the core code in a module, this would be pretty trivial to move to the CPAN. (If only for the exercise)</p>

Bouncy requires an experimental redesign branch of
SDL. when it's stable it'll get tidied up and go to CPAN.
