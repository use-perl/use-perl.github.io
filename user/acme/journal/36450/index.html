I thought I was over my jetlag, but instead I woke up at 4am this morning.
This was a perfect excuse to head over to Tsukiji for sushi for breakfast.
So good!
</p><p>
First talk this morning Kang-min Liu "&#8206;JavaScript::Writer fun".
"my new toy". "You write Perl, Perl writes JavaScript".
AUTOLOAD magic. "The stock price on Prototype.js is going down"
</p><p>
Daisuke Murase (&#8206;typester&#8206;) - "&#8206;FormValidator::Assets&#8206;", which looked
interesting.
</p><p>
Hiroshi Sakai (&#8206;ziguzagu&#8206;) - &#8206;"OpenSource TypePad Mobile&#8206;" was all about
hacking Atom and Movable Type open source including HTML::Split,
teasing about HTML::MobileFilter, open emoticons,
</p><p>
Masahiro Nagano (&#8206;kazeburo&#8206;) - &#8206;"memcached in mixi&#8206;" gave general details
about memcached use and then went into details at mixi: 94% cache hit rate,
223 GB cache in total, maxing out at 15,000 requests per second at 400Mbps.
Interesting they up the number of buckets in memcached's internal
hash table from 16 to 25 as they have large objects.
</p><p>
Chia-liang Kao - "Branch Managment with SVK 2.2". Workflow for feature-based
development - features or bugfixes handled in branches, then merged to RC
(QA, testing) and then merged to trunk and live. There is a new 
svk branch command.
</p><p>
Tatsuhiko Miyagawa - 20 modules I haven't yet talked about". Renamed
to 10 modules: HTTP::ProxyPAC (Spidermonkey, argh), 
pQuery ('no capitalization 'pQuery::DOM'),
PHP::Session "I've actually never used it",
autobox::DateTime::Duration,
Time::Duration::Parse,
Encode::DoubleEncodedUTF8 "useful and evil",
URI::Find::UTF8,
Lingua::JA::Hepburn::Passport,
LWP::UserAgent::Keychain,
XML::Liberal "People are stupid. Cloud is full of crap. Software can fix it".
"I want to hear your version of this talk if you have >10 modules on CPAN".
</p><p>
We had a quick lunch - curry-don, mmm.
</p><p>
Jesse Vincent - &#8206;Everything but the secret sauce&#8206;
Find bugs faster: TAP::Harness::Parallel, 
  TAP::Harness::Remote, TAP::Harness::Remote::EC2,
  Carp::REPL.
Build web apps: Template::Declare (soon: compile to JavaScript),
  CSS::Squish.
Ship software: App::ChangeLogger, Shipwright (build all dependencies,
  everything above libc - platform neutral source distribution
  or platform specific binary distribution).
Get input from users: Date::Extract, the feedback box.
Own the Inbox: Net::IMAP::Server, with.hm.
</p><p>
Then we ate Yahoo! Japan snacks. Really.
</p><p>
Casey West - "Build Domain Specific Languages with Perl" 
testing DSL along the lines of "Title should be {'Twitter'}".
</p><p>
Jeff Kim - "Gungo and cloud computing, a scalable crawling
and processing framework" deployed on EC2 and S3 and a happy user.
</p><p>
Then the wrapup started - Jose Castro told us what he had learned
in Tokyo (he can stop Japanese babies crying), Schwern told us
that Perl is a zombie (oh no wait, it was really about 
decentralising and caring about people who aren't other
programmers) and then it was over. Many thanks for an excellent
conference!
