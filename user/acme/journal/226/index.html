<p>OK, it's been a long weekend, and Trelane's convinced me to use this as a real journal, not just a tech journal, so....
<p>
I organised a London.pm technical meeting so that I could practice my "Instant Compilers" talk on people (and we also got Simon Wistow with "Flash in the Pan", and Simon Cozens with "Mail::Audit").
<p>
My talk went fairly well. I got the timing about right, but 
it's hard to decide what level to aim it at and what details to gloss over. I'm sure it'll turn out okay - everyone who was there enjoyed it and learned something. The other talks were fine too.
<p>
"Instant Compilers" is about building a framework to compile little (and not so little) computer languages into Perl. It's pretty cool stuff. All will be revealed at <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/perl/">TPC5</a>...
<p>
(cross-over with Simon's journal) Then we went drinking, had Pimm's, and went drinking again. It was fun. (end cross-over).
<p>
On Sunday, muttley organised a "Hackspoitation" video evening, which rocked. I hadn't seen "Tron" before. I hadn't seen "Takedown" before either, but that was less interesting ;-)
<p>
On Monday, I <i>didn't</i> do a constrained walk around the Circle Line, but rather met with the walkers in a pub and then went out with Trelane to a rather splendid summer dinner in 
<a href="http://www.zagat.com/search/Details.asp?RID=8115&NDPH=dakota&VID=1&PID=1&LID=39">Dakota</a>, which had wonderful corn blinis. There are so many cool restaurants and bars near where I live (Notting Hill). I dispair sometimes... &lt;g&gt;
<p>
Hmmm, that didn't work. Forget all that - I'm not a real person, honest, I actually stay indoors all day and geek out. Maybe. Anyway, back to a techie journal next time I think.</p>
