<p><p><a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/iweb/">iWeb</a> eh? I noticed the <a href="http://businesslogs.com/technology/iwebgenerated_source_code_is_awful.php">bad HTML</a>. I noted the <a href="http://theubergeeks.net/iweb/Blog/B10894CC-A677-4C81-8ECC-6AC9DBA11DDE.html">horrible URLs</a>. I cringed at the <a href="http://theubergeeks.net/iweb/Welcome.html">image reflections</a> but the thing that really got me angry was the fact that the blog feeds <a href="http://rss.mac.com/colindevroe/iWeb/Site/Blog/rss.xml">are RSS</a> but Photocasts <a href="http://photocast.mac.com/colindevroe/iPhoto/testcast/index.rss">aren't </a> (on .Mac at least: "We're Sorry. The browser you are using does not support the display of photocasts."). What is this, Microsoft?

Paul always explained that PowerBooks were so heavy (even the new MacBook Pro is 2.54 kg!) because they needed a DVD drive, and yet the <a href="http://products.sony.co.uk/tx2_fs400_a600.asp">new Vaio TX2</a>, while CPU-challenged, has 7.5 hours of battery life, includes a DVDÃÂ±RW and weighs only 1.24kg. I might have to pop by Akihabara when I'm in <a href="http://tokyo.yapcasia.org/">YAPC::Asia</a>...</p></p>

<p>I get the same message on both IE and Firefox on Windows. Perhaps there's a new browser that hasn't been released yet that it'll work on. Either that or they haven't written the functionality yet. I suspect the latter.

I'm very suspicious of desktop website building packages these days, as so much cruft gets added, that simple fixes can take hours and pages can take "ages" to download. I recently reworked a friend's site, who was using the Serif Web Page Maker. His site measured in at 10 pages and over 10MB of files before I touched it. Having cleaned it up, used CSS properly and amended the images the package created, it now stands at less than 4MB, and virtually all that is now just his photos. 6MB of poorly applied CSS and images.</p>



<h2>RSS</h2>

<p>There is actually RSS buried in there somewhere..</p>

<p> <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/01/11/Photocasting#c1137118217" title="intertwingly.net">fortunately, there are fixes.</a intertwingly.net>
</p>

<p>The linked greasemonkey script works really well. Assuming you use Firefox. Which I do. Bwhahahaha.
</p>

<p>Also, I think richard has one of those vaios. He has <i>a</i> vaio, and it's <i>very</i>cute.

What huh? Did you mean me up there?<br><br>I've changed my mind. PowerBooks are heavy because they have slot-loading DVD drives. And 2.5" not 1.8" hard drives. (1.8" HDs suck. Small, hot and expensive.)
