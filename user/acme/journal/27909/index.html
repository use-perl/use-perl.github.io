<p><p>This is something I've seen on other projects, but never experienced myself before until now: open source zealots. These are people who will complain for months that if project Y were open source, then they would hack on it and improve it. To get them to stop whining, you open source the project and of course all the people who said they would contribute code do not. A month of whining and no code! As pointed out in the London.pm meeting yesterday, it's not a total loss: at least they've stopped whining ;-)

The fog effect in RealLife looks particularly good today - almost as good as in the latest Harry Potter film. Here's hoping that no dragons come swooping out of this fog...

ObPerl: Image::Imlib2 doesn't support blending two images together, so I had to use Image::Magick yesterday, erk!

<h2>Patience!</h2>

<p>Patience &mdash; since you provided the code there hasn't yet been an intersection between me encountering an itchy bit of your site and having some scratching time available, but that doesn't mean it won't happen.</p>

<p>Also there's the matter that it takes a while to get up to speed on code you haven't seen before, so it's going to take some time before contributing something from first checking out the code (and even getting as far as that first step is going to require learning at least the basics of using Subversion).</p>

What they actually mean is that if you open source it, someone else will contribute code.
<p>
It's just like with all those threads on Perlmonks and Usenet to redesign Perl or CPAN. Grand ideas, but whenever you point out noone is stopping them to submit patches, or start an alternative CPAN, nothing actually comes forth.</p>
