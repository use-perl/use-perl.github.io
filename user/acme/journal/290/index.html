<p><i>I got up at 5am this morning. I do believe I still have jetlag, ugggh. Lovely morning, though.</i>
<p>
Yesterday was the first day of YAPC::NorthAmerica 2001 and what a day it was. With an early start (for me, ahem), I met up with <i>everyone</i> (yes, that is a blanket "everyone". You all know who you are ;-).
<p>
Damian started off the conference with a keynote on Perl6, which is getting more interesting. I've seen his Perl6 talk a couple of times and the slides keep on changing and he always seems to highlight cool things I've missed. Damian rocks.
<p>
Wireless access in the rooms. Killer app. Talk about the speakers (and attendees) behind their back. Wonderful!
<p>
I then went to "CPAN, PPM and the future", which seemed to bring up all the old questions about how CPAN could be better, such as: more metadata, a ratings system (like the
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/trust-metric.html">Advogato</a> trust metric), different categorisation and so on. I think they'll be another BOF on this, and it looks like aevil will force me to go and take notes ;-)
<p>
During that talk, I finished and released version 1.0 of my <a href="http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/L/LB/LBROCARD/GraphViz-1.0.tar.gz">GraphViz</a> module. I'm giving a talk on it on Friday and I thought it would be appropriate. Of course, it's finally a 1.0 release but unimatrix and 2shortplanks have MacOS X compatibility and default node patches they want me to include...
<p>I then went to "Perl Apprenticeship Hour", where people gave out ideas for projects. gnat's were the best, of course.
<p>
A quick lunch later and I found myself in Brian Ingerson's 

"Programming with Perl and C using Inline.pm", which as usual was excellent. Brian told me at the start of the class to do something cool with Inline. I wrote, tested, and documented
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/L/LB/LBROCARD/Tie-GHash-0.10.tar.gz">Tie::GHash</a>
and uploaded it to the CPAN before the end of his talk. Brian's asked me to do a complete writeup of the process, so expect another journal entry later on ;-)
<p>
 The evening was fun. We went to a "smoked beef" place, which accomodated 50 hungry Perl hackers easily, then off to a cool pub with a guy I'd met at ApacheCon London. A few beers later, we drove up to Mount-Royal and checked out the city from a lookout point. Very pretty indeed. A racoon attacked us, but I made it back to the dorms safely, avoiding a software licensing argument (err, discussion) on the way in.
<p>
Today is going to be much more hectic. And fun. Well done to lenzo, lucs, mendel and the rest of the guys for setting up another wonderful conference!
