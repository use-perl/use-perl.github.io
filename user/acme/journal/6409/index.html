<p>Summer is here and everyone is gearing up to head down to sunny San Diego for the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2002/">O'Reilly Open Source Conference</a>. I'm really looking forward to it. I'll meet up with cool Perl (and Java and XML and Apache etc.) programmers, drink tequila, fail to make up my mind as to which of the many talks to go to, eat worms at the quiz show (oh, that was last year, maybe Jon will be more inventive this year...) and enjoy myself at the day-long Parrot track. It's going to rock.
<p>
However, if it's at the same time of year next year I won't be able to go. My sister has said that I can't miss her birthday <b>again</b>...</p>

Pah, you can still do both next year.  Buy her a plane ticket for her birthday.

I asked her this actually. Strangely enough she didn't seem to want to hang out with Perl geeks for a week at a hotel. I wonder why...

<p>Yet she insists spending her birthday with this one particular Perl geek?</p>

  Hey, some Perl geeks are sexy! Send her a pic of me, I'm sure she'll want to go next year!

<h2>Not same time</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-07-17T12:13:56</h3>
<p>Gnat implied to me that it would probably not be at the same time next year.  Which is good, because I cannot go this year because of this <a href="http://www.singingschool.net/" title="singingschool.net">singing school</a singingschool.net> (warning: religious link), likely to be the same week from here on out.</p>

<p>Note carefully that I said he <i>implied</i> to me.  He didn't guarantee or anything.</p>

<p>I made YAPC::America this year, my first conference, and I loved it.  Any more chances I get to do that kind of thing will be great.</p>

Currently the choice is between July 16-19 or June 9-14.  At this point I think we'll be going for July, but the plan is to decide that this week.  This should let you appease your sister (honestly, what nerve she has!) and let jdavidb raise his voice to Heaven.<p>

And regardless of which week, it won't be in San Diego again.  Whichever city is chosen, you <i>will</i> enjoy it.</p><p>

We aim to please.</p><p>

it all?)</p>

San Fran, San Fran, San Fran, San Fran<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br> <br>Actually, there's lots of other cool cities too.  And San Diego was cool except the hotel wasn't actually near any of the cool parts, so you couldn't _walk_ anywhere except the damn airport.

Can it be a city that has cheaper accommodation close to the conference hall/hotel of choice, seeing as I have to pay out of my own pocket. It was going to cost me close to &#163;2500 this year for flights, hotel and conference ticket, and a large chunk of that was the hotel costs<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(
<p>
Any idea whether a European venture will on the cards for next year too?</p>

Please - oh please - do find something not on the west coast of the US.<p>
Polling the participants at TPC for where they come from will show a large number from CA - strangely enough<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p><p>
Lets try smewhere else the next time: the east coast, or dare I suggest: Europe or at least somewhere exotic.</p><p>
If we have to travel 9 or 10 timezones to get to the TPC then do at least have it somewhere exotic, like the Fiji, Samoa, Barbados, the Virgin Islands,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p>
