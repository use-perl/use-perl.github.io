I received a letter from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_telecom">BT</a> today. I thought it was marketing spam. The first big heading is "You have Free UK Weekend calls from now on". Sure looks like marketing spam. The first paragraph is:
</p>
<blockquote>
At BT, we're always looking for ways to give you more value for money. From the beginning of February 2008 we are giving you, as an existing BT Together Option 1 customer, Free UK Weekend calls. You don't have to contact us or do anything to claim these free calls. You can just start using them this weekend.
</blockquote>
<p>
Ah, how friendly. The second heading is "Sign up for Free UK Evening calls, as well". Oh, they want  me to pay for something, a sure sign of marketing spam.
</p>
<p>
The third headline, the smallest, is "Other changes to your Calling Plans". This is probably the bit most people ignore. The first paragraph is about how they are renaming the plans (telecoms companies like to do this every few years to confuse their customers and to stop them from comparing plans). The next paragraph is the reason they are sending the letter: they've increased the price of basic line rental.
</p>
<p>
Dear BT, please don't hide price increases in marketing spam.
</p>
<p>
(Sorry, no Perl content, but BT have annoyed me enough in the past).

I don't believe Douglas Adams had much use for BT either.
