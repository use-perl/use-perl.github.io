<p>On Friday there was an Emap Online reunion. Emap Online is a company I used to work for and it's exactly a year ago that they made everyone redundant (which was the beginning of my couple of months of CFT). It was a fun place to work, but we were of course leaking money and it had to end at some point. We all met up in the pub we used to always go to when we were still working together, told amusing xmas stories, and then went over the road to "Yo! Below", a fun sushi / sake place. The night got sillier as we had more sake.<br/><br/>Early the next morning, I somehow work up and staggered into my Simply Japanese cookery course, where I somehow managed to make proper sushi rice and roll various bits of sushi, adding way to much wasabi for my own good. It was quite relaxing and sobered me up very slowly.<br/><br/>I've found a wonderful Japanese fishmongers (Atari-Ya) which provides amazing fish at a reasonable price (compared to, say, eating it at "Yo! Sushi"). The yellowtail (and sweet prawn) there is fantastic. I think I'll just eat sashimi from now on...</p>

<p>
Yes, yes they are. I'd only been at that company for two months and they were struggling at the end, we just hadn't realised at all. The worst thing was that they hired someone on Monday and made the whole of the company redundant on Friday (just before christmas, not a very nice present indeed). The next couple of weeks was talking about who would get what  compensation package: very little work got done, we got into work at midday, used bandwidth, went to the pub. It wasn't very happy at all. It's a shame, 'cos it was once of the more fun places I've worked...</p>
