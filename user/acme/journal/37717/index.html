<p><a href="http://a4.vox.com/6a00c2251cf7cc549d00fad6b6e61c0005-500pi" alt="IXS_0696" />[cloud slide]</a><br/><br/> <div>Yesterday <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/?p=106">Rackspace announced</a> that it had acquired <a href="http://www.slicehost.com/rackspace">Slicehost</a> (one of the best VPS hosting services) and <a href="http://www.jungledisk.com/RackspaceFAQ.aspx">Jungle Disk</a> (a backup service that stores files on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3.</a> But that&#39;s not all, it looks like they want to be the cloud provider of choice and have also launched <a href="http://cloud.rackspace.com/">Rackspace Cloud services</a>, including <a href="http://cloud.rackspace.com/cloudfiles.jsp">Cloud Files</a>: &quot;Scalable, dynamic storage. Use as much or little as you want and only pay for what you use&quot;. Rackspace have been hinting that they were working on this for a while, see <a href="http://blog.racklabs.com/?p=77">How to Build a Storage System</a> including the hint that this would be a good use for their older servers (looks like CloudFS has turned into Cloud Files).<br /><br />Now as the author of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-Amazon-S3/">Net::Amazon::S3</a> I was overjoyed. I&#39;m in the middle of rewriting that module to make it more flexible and take full advantage of the S3 service. But there&#39;s no point having backup in the cloud if there is only one place to back up, so I bought some chocolate and some Coke, hacked for an hour and released <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-Mosso-CloudFiles/">Net::Mosso::CloudFiles</a> last night.<br /><br />The Cloud Files API is clearly based on the same ideas as the S3 API, but it&#39;s slightly simpler: it is a clean REST design with plain text responses (instead of XML) and good use of HTTP response codes. The main difference I&#39;ve found so far is that one of the great features of Amazon S3 is that listing a bucket (container) also gives you the ETags of the files. It looks like in CloudFiles you have to do a HEAD request on each file to get the same functionality at the moment. Otherwise, looks nice.<br /></div><br/><br/>            </div>

<p>Sweet, nice work!</p><p>Adding more info to container and object lists is definitely on our wishlist as well.  It'll probably come in the form of a URL param to enable extended results.</p>
