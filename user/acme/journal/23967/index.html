<h1>A new Perl debugger!</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/acme/">acme</a> on 2005-04-01T06:20:17</h2>
</div> <!-- /span4 -->


<div class="span8">
<p>In my <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme/journal/23905">previous journal entry</a>, I talked about amusing comments or bits of code I found in the Perl debugger. Now, you might wonder what sort of insane person would look inside perl5db.pl for fun? Well, I blame obra. Not only did he mention that someone should write a new debugger for Perl, he also told me this while I had a laptop to hand <b>and</b> he handed me a beer.
<p>
What's wrong with the existing Perl debugger, you ask? Well, it's a bit, errr "crufty". It's grown organically, is quite huge, doesn't have a test suite, and contains amusing comments. For some reason, I was dreaming of an object oriented interface to debugging a program, which would make writing debugger front-ends easy.
<p>
So, like any good little extreme programmer, I sat down and wrote a few tests before writing any code:
</p>
<pre>
my $ebug = Devel::ebug->new;
$ebug->program("t/calc_oo.pl");
$ebug->load;
is($ebug->line, 7);
is($ebug->filename, 't/calc_oo.pl');
$ebug->step;
is($ebug->line, 8);
is($ebug->filename, 't/calc_oo.pl');
$ebug->next;
is($ebug->line, 9);
is($ebug->filename, 't/calc_oo.pl');
$ebug->run;
is($ebug->finished, 1);
</pre>
<p>
Well, there were more tests. I mean, there's quite a few things you might want to do in a debugger, like set break points (with conditions), set watch  points (conditions sans a line number), inspect variables, evaluate code, return from subroutine and more.
<p>
So I sat up late into the night, hacked on Perl code, and a few hours later had a new Perl debugger with tests and documentation. I reckon autrijus' energy must be rubbing off onto me.
<p>
And then I wondered what kind of interface you might want. I mean, having a console interface to a debugger, but it's not really exciting and I hate having to remember that "b code.pl 6 $x &gt; 7" sets a break point at line 6 of code.pl where it'll only stop if $x &gt; 7. So then I thought about GUIs, and I played a little bit with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Curses-UI/">Curses::UI</a> speccing out an interface, but I decided it wasn't quite flexible enough. <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Gtk2/">Gtk2</a> might well be the way to go, but I thought that we all have web browsers, and with JavaScript thesedays we have the technology to make nice rich web interfaces. Thus I designed a <a href="http://www.astray.com/tmp/ebug.png">sample web interface</a> which shows off the main features a debugger would have.
<p>
So I threw a few modules together and built that very web app that you see in the screenshot above. Actually, I spent more time making "s" keystrokes automatically "step" using JavaScript than I spent building the web application. I guess I should brush up on my Ajax skills.
<p>
Ok, so it doesn't do <b>everything</b> you might want a debugger to do, but I did manage to build a complete Perl debugger in a few hours, which has a nice OO interface, and a web frontend. Neat, huh?
<p>
Of course, what's really scary is that this isn't an April Fool's joke. It's actually on CPAN as <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-ebug/">Devel::ebug</a>.
Patches welcome. Enjoy.</p>

<h2>Looks Great!</h2>

This looks really great. How are the possibilities of hooking this one into a running CGI or even mod_perl process?

It's absolutely possible.

<p>Would it work this way:</p>

<p>I tell a CGI script to run under -d:ebug. Then the debugger tells me about the secret and port number, which enables me in turn to connect to that debugging session.</p>

<p>This method doesnt seem to be directly supported by the module, but I am probably missing the point.</p>
