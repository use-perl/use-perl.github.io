<p>The Perl Foundation took part in Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of Code</a> program and managed to get <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/news/2005/googlesoc2.html">8 projects funded</a>. This is the third in a series of informal interviews finding out more information about these projects. Up now is David Buchman  with "Perl Megadistro".
<p>
<b>Hi there! Tell us a bit about yourself, including age, where you
are a student and what you are studying</b><br/>
 I am currently 20 years old, and am currently a student at Middlesex County College, in New Jersey.
         I am currently studying Computer Science, in a degree program -- I have been interested in computer-related courses for some time, both hardware and software related -- additionally, I am interested in network administration.
         I am also a big supporter of open source projects, and appreciate all the work that the community has done thus far, in a multitude of aspects.
<p>
<b>You've had a Google Summer of Code project funded. What will you be
doing? How will you be doing this? What's the final product?</b><br/>
        I will be creating a megadistro, so to speak, of Perl, which will encapsulate lots of useful modules (essential and additional) -- after which, I will create Makefile to build the install -- finally,  after testing the install, ensuring that everything passes `make test`, I will package it.
        The intent for the final product, will be a nice and thorough package, of perl, built for each and every major distro.
<p>
<b>How did you get interested in this topic?</b><br/>
      I was quite interested in developing a project for the SoC (Google - Summer of Code 2005), namely with TPF (The Perl Foundation). This past semester I had just completed a course in perl, and became quite interested in the language; moreover, this past semester, I was busily developing my own, personal projects, some of which utilized perl and many perl modules.
       After trying to think of a feasible project to develop for TPF, I thought of this as the best project, in which I could benefit TPF, as well as, the community, as I had recently experienced the complexities and complications that can go into installing perl and many modules, which I needed to acquire and install (when working on personal projects, using perl).
<p>
<b>Where do you see your project going after this summer?</b><br/>
    Honestly, I have not really sought past this summer, as much work awaits, but hopefully, this project will be continually built on; the Makefile updated appropriately, more modules added here and there, repackage, and redistribute ;)
<p>
<b>Is there any way to track your progress over the next few months?
Got a blog?</b><br/>
 Although, at the moment, I had no plans with regard to that aspect, I will try to get some sort of page up, which will track my continual work on this project -- personally, I am not one to blog, anything -- I am more typically accustomed to the developer and commit e-mail lists.
<p>
<b>Did you expect to get funded?</b><br/>

   Honestly, I really didn't have any expectations as towards whether or not I would get funded; I merely entertained the idea that I would be working on a project for TPF.
       Though I have experience with open source projects, and had the opportunity to take courses related to some of the material I actually work on, whether it be perl or another area, I did not think that it would give me a better shot at getting my project funded over that of any other ambitious student.
       However, now that my project is funded, I eagerly await the mountain of work that lies ahead :)
<p>
<b>Got a silly fact about yourself or the project?
</b><br/>
   As for myself, nothing comes to mind, presently -- though if there any developments on that front, I'll make sure to let the community know ;)
       With regards to the project, I cannot think of anything particularly silly,... yet -- check back with me in a week or two, I'm sure we'll have much to talk about then.</p>

<h2>What will be included in the megadistro?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/itub/">itub</a> on 2005-07-11T21:15:14</h3>
I think that's probably a question in many people's minds. I don't think we can all agree on what should be included, but it would be good to have a way of sending our suggestions.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)



<h2>So...</h2>

he's been given a grant to create Bundle::?<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; -- or --<br><br>We already have a Perl "megadistro". It's called BioPerl!<br><br>Thank you, I'll be here all week. Tip your waitress.

<p>Google chose which projects got funding, not The Perl Foundation. You would need to ask Google about their choices.</p>
<p>Given that it's Google's money that is paying for all this, to me it seems reasonable that they get to decide where it goes. But as the SEC notes, <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/08/23/google_tops_corporate_sleaze_rating/" title="theregister.co.uk">Google is not the most transparent of organisations</a theregister.co.uk>, so it wouldn't surprise me if they declined to explain anything.</p>
