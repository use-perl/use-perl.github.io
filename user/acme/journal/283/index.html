<p>I'm writing from the registration area of YAPC::NorthAmerica, woohoo!
<p>
My flight from London went fine, and I followed unimatrix's decision to get a cab from the airport. This turned out to be a wonderful idea as the residences are, how shall I put it, on a small incline.
<p>
I got here in time to meet up with people (uri, unimatrix, ingy etc.) and to head off downtown to an asian restaurant (Mr Yans). It was quite a walk, and the restaurant was under a different name, but we met up with a great many people. So many people, in fact, that we slashdotted the restaurant (or should that be perlmongered?). So much so that half of us went to the restaurant opposite. It was a laugh though, and the food was pretty good.
<p>
Registration on the first day is about to open (I'm eagerly awaiting lenzo, lucs, and mendel), and today is a day of tutorials, which means that everyone will be writing their slides for tomorrow ;-)
<p>
I'll try and keep you updated on the conference. If you have anything in particular you want to know, just tell me...
