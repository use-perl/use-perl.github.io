This weekend I travelled off to snowy Hannover and attended <a href="http://www.cebit.de/">CeBIT</a>. It's the first time I've been to this "digital solutions for work and life" forum and it is <i>huge</i>. Just walking around completely tired me out, there were so many things to see. Here's a few highlights. I took a few photos but Engadget has completely outdone me, so I'll just link to them.
</p>
<p>
By far the most impressive stand was <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/03/10/live-from-cebit-o2-booth-tour/">O2 </a>, who had a pulsating ceiling of blue tubes and a neat on-stand radio station. People just hung out there because it was cool. Bit boring though.
</p>
<p>
The most impressive vendor was Samsung. They had a  <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/03/09/live-from-cebit-samsungs-sch-b600-10-megapixel-cameraphone/">10 megapixel cameraphone</a> (a bit chunky), lovely laptops, a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/03/09/live-at-cebit-intel-press-briefing-origami-is-dead-long-liv/">UMPC</a> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/03/09/samsungs-q1-ultramobile-pc/">system</a> (I don't see this replacing laptops, sorry) and huge screens. All the Xbox360 demo pods used Samsung screens - they were really nice. Samsung really rock this year with good design and good technology.
</p>
<p>
In general everybody showed off big TV screens. Very big TV screens. I now have TV screen envy.
</p>
<p>
I was actually looking for a GPS unit for my car and there were new announcements from both <a href="http://www.tomtom.com/products/category.php?ID=0&Language=1">Tomtom</a> (the 510, 710, 910 with nice big screens) and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/03/09/garmin-intros-c510-530-c550-and-screenless-mobile-20-with-bluet/">Garmin</a>
(the c510/530, C550 with large easy-to-use UI). It's just a shame that the units could not pick up any satellites from inside the buildings. I haven't decided which one to get yet, hmm.
</p>
<p>
I mentioned the new Microsoft Office user interface in a <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme/journal/28951">previous entry</a> and I got to see it in real life on a huge screen on the Microsoft stand. Actually looks quite nice in action.
</p>
<p>
There were also lots of MP3 players, lots of portable video players (including DVB-T and T-DMB) and lots of other things which don't interest me at this time. Did I mention that CeBIT was huge?
</p>
<p>
But my favourite stand of all was, errr, I wasn't paying attention. It was in the business processes area, and the company had set up a free waffle-onna-stick stand in the corner. Free waffles, mmmm.
