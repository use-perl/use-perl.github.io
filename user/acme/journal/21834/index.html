<p>I have a dream. I have a dream of all the media I own being seamlessly accessible, whereever I am.
<p>
One type of media that I own is music. This is an easy one, as all of the music that I own fits onto my iPod (and is backed up on many computers). Done.
<p>
I also own quite a few DVDs. Now, I can access them fairly easily, but if I want them online I need to rip them, and DVDs take up a few gigs each. This means I need diskspace. Cue some mirrored external FireWire drives - mirrored for robustness, because drives die all the frickin time. Drives will get cheaper in future, so I picked a good price point for now and will buy more in two years. Ripping DVDs takes a while, but  now I get my DVDs all instantly accessible.
<p>
I have an old-school TiVo, which I love. However, I can't access the shows that it has recorded and save them for watching months later. Or for watching on the plane. This annoyed me for a while, until I purchased an <a href="http://www.elgato.com/index.php?file=products_eyetv400">EyeTV 400</a> - a FireWire digital terrestrial television (DVB-T) receiver. <a href="http://www.freeview.co.uk/">Free DVB-T</a> is pretty big in the UK. So I win over my TiVo, as it is digital (MPEG2 through the airwaves) and it's now portable, so I can time- and space-shift movies to when I'm waiting at the airport. The software is quite nice: <a href="http://astray.com/tmp/eyetv.jpg">screenshot</a> - bear in mind it's an MPEG2 snapshot reencoded as  JPEG, it actually looks really good. All is good.
<p>
The EyeTV links in with an <a href="http://www.tvtv.co.uk/">online TV guide</a> for scheduling, which is OK. However, it can't do automated scheduling, like "record all CSI, and all good movies". Luckily, EyeTV is AppleScript-able, so Perl comes to the rescue. I've just released <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Mac-EyeTV/">Mac::EyeTV</a> to CPAN, which allows you to view scheduled programmes and schedule your own.
<p>
But that's only one piece in the puzzle. I need schedule information, which generally isn't easy to find. I used <a href="http://membled.com/work/apps/xmltv/">xmltv</a>, which has a really annoying configuration process. However, with a little bit of work I can now record all CSI episodes. Now how do I know if a movie is good? Well, xmltv gives RadioTimes ratings, but they suck. Luckily, most of the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/interfaces">data behind IMDB</a> is available, so with a bit of hacking of ratings.list, I now record films with high IMDB ratings.
<p>
Now sadly programmes tend to clash. I detect this with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DateTime-Set/">DateTime::Span and DateTime::SpanSet</a>. Two annoyances: a span has a start and an end (boo! Beginning and end, start and stop, don't mix them) and that it wasn't clear to me that a span from 9:00 to 10:00 clashes with a span from 10:00 to 11:00, pesky fenceposts).
<p>
It's all come together. I can record everything I want to record, and it's all ready to be portable or shared to my luxury flats across Europe (cough). Technology doesn't all suck, as long as I get my entertainment. Hacking this all together took an afternoon, and that's the kind of interesting project I like and want to do more of in future. Web sites just aren't da bomb any more.
<p>
In other news, I mentioned Apple System Logger in my last entry, which seems pretty much like a well-integrated messaging system, but I'm still the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22apple+system+logger%22">only hit for it</a>... (Updated: "only two hits for it" ;-)</p>

Just one question: why'd you use RunAppleScript in Programme.pm?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>I had a few little tools I used for EyeTV way back when, but I don't have anything that can use my EyeTV box anymore (it is the original USB one, and I don't get any cable or antenna signals).
