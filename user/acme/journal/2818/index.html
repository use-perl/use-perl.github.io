<p>Tomorrow is the first day of the <a href="http://www.perl-workshop.de/">German Perl Workshop</a> which the <a href="http://www.fotango.com">the company I work for</a> is kindly letting me attend. They've been asking for volunteers to write up reports, and strangely enough I was going to do that anway ;-) so here we are.
<p>
I went to the GPW last year and it was great fun and I got to practice my German. This year, I'm not staying at the hotels near the conference, but rather with qmacro, who has been kind enough to put me up (and provide an ethernet port in my bedroom!). He probably should have warned me that Joseph, his four year old son, would be dancing to AC-DC tonight ;-). Occasionally I worry that 4-year-olds can talk better German than me, but I'm sure it'll come flooding back.
<p>
The <a href="http://www.perl-workshop.de/2002/times.epl">timetable</a> for the conference looks very good. Damian will be doing a tour de force again and there are lots of interesting topics. I'm talking about <a href="http://www.parrotcode.org/">Parrot</a>, of course, so I get to confuse people with assembler. I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
<p>
This is my first trip out to Europe this year, and I'm finding using the Euro to be wonderful. You have no idea how many different currencies I used to have at home. I also vaguely know the exchange rate, which is handy.
<p>
<i>Oh, and yes, the flight over was fine</i>...</p>
