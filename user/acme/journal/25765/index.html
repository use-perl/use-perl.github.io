<p>The Perl Foundation took part in Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/summer
ofcode.html">Summer of Code</a> program and managed to get <a href="http://www.p
erlfoundation.org/news/2005/googlesoc2.html">8 projects funded</a>. This is the 
seventh in a series of informal interviews finding out more information about these projects. Up now is Curtis Rawls   with "Compiler/Optimizer Improvements to Parrot".
<p>
<b>Hi there! Tell us a bit about yourself, including age, where you
are a student and what you are studying</b><br/>
My name is Curtis Rawls, and I am a 24-year-old graduate student in
Computer Science at North Carolina State University.  My areas of
interest are in compiler technology, natural language, and interactive
narrative.  Also, I am working as an intern this summer for HP.
<p>
<b>You've had a Google Summer of Code project funded. What will you be
doing? How will you be doing this? What's the final product?</b><br/>
My project is to make improvements to the optimizing portion of the
Parrot compiler (the future VM for Perl6).  There are a lot of areas
that need attention and improvement in the optimizer, such as
implementing SSA form, register allocation, various small
optimizations, and of course documentation.  I won't have a "final
product" per se; all my changes get commited as they are completed.
My goal is to get as many improvements done as I can in the time
allotted. : )
<p>
<b>How did you get interested in this topic?</b><br/>
I came across the idea of working with Parrot while searching for a
project for a compiler optimization course I took this spring.  While
I didn't end up working with it for my class, I decided to lend a hand
to use what I had learned in my schoolwork.
<p>
<b>Where do you see your project going after this summer?</b><br/>
This is an "open-ended" project, which can also be translated as
"never-ending". : )  A lot of my efforts will be geared towards
facilitating future changes: SSA form is a base for a lot of
interesting optimizations, and documentation is the best way to get
other people involved and up-to-speed quickly.

<p>
<b>Is there any way to track your progress over the next few months?
Got a blog?</b><br/>
I don't have a blog for this project at the moment.  I work with the
other Parrot developers on the <a href="http://lists.perl.org/showlist.cgi?name=perl6-internals">perl6-internals</a>  mailing list, so all my patches, questions, and utter
confusion are on display there.
<p>
<b>Did you expect to get funded?</b><br/>
I had no idea.  The Summer of Code project is quite new, so there was
no standard of reference.  I hope the Perl SoCers will set some high
standards for the program in the future! : )
<p>
<b>Got a silly fact about yourself or the project?
</b><br/>
I had already intended to work on Parrot in my spare time this summer.
 Getting funded is great because now I have some incentive (pressure?)
to finish all my objectives.</p>
