I just sent this as an email but then I realized that I'd rather post it here for all the world to see<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br> <br>Lumping Alazbo in with SPOPS and Tangram is highly misleading.  Methinks you haven't actually looked at what it does.<br> <br>You say '"Almost, but not quite" e.g. schemas change'<br> <br>Duh!<br> <br>Alzabo is a _data modelling_ tool as well.  If your schema needs to change you can use the data modelling tool to change it.  Simple, easy, quick.<br>And then you can ask it to generate the SQL needed to update your RDBMS with the new schema (ALTER TABLE<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...).  Or you could change your schema in<br>the RDBMS and tell Alzabo to sync itself with the RDBMS.  Also quite simple.<br> <br>And once your schema changes, it can _still_ auto-generate (on the fly, not to a file) methods that are appropriate for your schema.<br> <br>As to needing a "proper object database" for Perl, IMHO, an object database is useless for many reasons, but if you did want one, that's what Tangram is!

[oh, then i guess i'll post my reply here too]
<p>
Oh, sorry, the slides didn't make it quite clear. In the actual talk I
did say that Alzabo handles schema changes and generally gets closer
to what we want it to do.
</p><p>
I'm afraid Alzabo still doesn't hit my personal sweet spot, so it
stays there<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
</p><p>
[about tangram being an oodb] No it's not. It just pretends to be. Something like Pixie, say is a proper object database. Unfortunately, object databases tend to be
slow. Oh well.</p>

But if you need to do actual queries, which _many_ applications need to do, you can't really use Pixie.<br> <br>If you only ever need to look things up by OID, and you _already_ know the OID of the object(s) you want, Pixie fits the bill.  But that's a _very_ narrow way to get at data.<br> <br>This hardly sounds like a "database" to me, since it has no facilities for querying whatsoever.<br> <br>A real OODBMS (for some values of "real") would simply allow you to call object/class methods and would transparently persist objects.  As to why _this_ too is a bad idea, <a href="http://searchdatabase.techtarget.com/tip/1,289483,sid13_gci769023,00.html" title="techtarget.com">this article</a techtarget.com> goes into more detail than I can here.
