<p>Yesterday I got to the conference kind of late, and went into the
OpenMMS talk. It looks like we may do MMS stuff at work, so I thought
it could be interesting. He needed more live demos, but a cool thing
he did was take a photo with a mobile phone and upload it live to a
website using MMS and Perl. Cool.
<p>
Then I went to gellyfish's talk on SOAP, which is also quite interesting
as the entire work project is one big web service, so I know a little about
the subject. gellyfish wasn't very organised, but he did manage to ramble
on for an hour without slides, which was good.
<p>
Then I went to Greg's "The Simulation and Visualisation of Objects in 3D",
which was fun but needed more 3D rotating bouncing camels. A quick
sausage later, and Paul's code coverage talk was good (more examples!).
<p>
The lightning talks were all fun: metaphors, WAIT, DNA, and Marathon. Then
I locked myself near to power and did the movie for that day. I then
went out with a German friend to a lovely posh restaurant near the
opera, nice and relaxing for my talk today. Arrggh, talk! PANIC!
