Well, it might or might not yet be a "<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/macosx@perl.org/msg09739.html" title="mail-archive.com">first class citizen</a mail-archive.com>" (which I mean to take "ships with the development tools").

I put that down to the fact that Sherm Pendley's worked for years on CamelBones with little or no reward, but at least some encouragement.<br><br>I suspect the answer to Leon's original question is a combination of "nobody wants to do it", "nobody wants it" and "the Perl world is too insular".

<p>Is it true that a subset of Perl that eliminates string eval and a couple of other features is parseable?  What's happened to efforts based on that?</p>

<p>I think such a subset is conceivable, but it won&#8217;t be of much practical interest, as it must necessarily exclude <code>BEGIN</code> as well as assignment to globs, which effectively means no <code>use</code>.</p>

No longer so. Take a look at <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=PPI&amp;mode=module" title="cpan.org">PPI</a cpan.org>, which is a programmatic way to parse and manipulate Perl code without perl. But I agree it probably came too late (2002? 2003?).

Perl already runs more places I care about than Java does, so to me, porting Perl to the JVM is an extravagant waste of time.  Worse still, forcing Perl to be performant on the JVM would doubtless require language changes.  Witness the recent trend of JRuby toward not implementing things because they're "too slow" or "too hard."  I expect JRuby will either languish in obsolescence like JPython, or become a separate language competing with actual Ruby.

<p>That said, Perl's having missed the "OMG Dynamic!!!" train is potentially damaging if too many new developers are brainwashed, and Perl starts getting dropped from default installs.</p>

<p>If Ruby 2.0 comes out soon and achieves many of its goals (especially with regard to performance and deployment characteristics), JRuby may be less appealing.</p>

It'll have to be fast, because the JRuby guys are *very* good marketers.  Watch how they gradually get people to refer to Ruby as "Matz' Ruby Interpreter" or "MRI", making it "just another implementation," and spin their really fast Fibonacci function into performance supposedly equivalent to Ruby 1.8.  I don't think they're attempting a "language takeover," but they could almost certainly pull it off if they (and Sun) wanted to.

I think that's a bit harsh. I personally have no problem with the term "MRI" since there are now multiple implementations (JRuby, IronRuby, Rubinius), and I don't use any of them.
<p>
Performance may be an issue, but I think a much bigger issue for JRuby will be memory and cpu consumption. I don't know that it's solveable with the JVM, either. Then again, most Java programmers have never given a damn about apps like Weblogic sucking the life out of their systems, so they probably won't care if JRuby does it, too.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:|</p>

<p>As I understand it (though one of my references is the JRuby literature), this is also a problem with standard Ruby and one of the motivations of JRuby.</p>



<h2>Re:No need</h2>

It may be a bit harsh or paranoid, but I don't see how a language without a formal spec can survive multiple implementations.  Python, Perl, and Ruby have been coherent so far because Guido's, Larry's, and Matz's implementations of their languages simply *are* those languages.  Looking farther afield, even Java survived in part because Sun fought Microsoft tooth and nail to prevent its producing an alternative, incompatible "Java" (Visual J++?).  Haskell thrives because GHC is the de facto standard.  And Scheme flounders because, beyond R5RS, there's no single standard-setting implementation for useful extensions.

<p>So I don't see a lot of hope for a language without an official (ANSI/ISO) standard unless it has a single canonical implementation, so that different behavior by another implementation is always a bug.

</p><p>And yeah, I'll continue to avoid Java and its insatiable hunger for memory like $UNPLEASANT_DISEASE...</p>

That's a good point. My gut tells me the Java programmers who want to be able to use an easier language, but still interface with the Java libraries, will stick with JRuby. The rest will move over to Ruby 2.0.
