<p>A quick muffin and a few excellent keynotes (I don't know Dick), here I am in the lightning talks. I see this as a challenge to summarise, hmmm. Andy Lester started off by explaining some words he doesn't allow in his team, such as "can't you just..." - good sensible stuff. MDJ then filled in with "Debugging the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/deBruijnSequence.html">De Bruijn sequence</a>, a lightning talk sans talk about deleting code (including a special "shut up uri" slide!). Casey talked about <a href="http://www.openjsan.org/">JSAN</a>: "How big is yours? Perl's is very big". And err, someone else on strategic and tactical thinking, which seems to be about <a href="http://csmintl.com/st_vs_tact_think.htm">planning ahead</a>. Elizabeth Cortell made a lunchbox from an O'Reilly book, in this case "Practical mod_perl" (picked because it's verbiage bloated)!.
Darren Duncan presented <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Rosetta/">Rosetta</a>, apparently not just another database wrapper. Rich Bowen finally gave in and told us why he hates Apache, which strangely enough is also why I hate Apache ;-)
A short break later and then Eric Wilhelm talked about building a beautiful bridge with Perl. Andy Lester came on again and told us how to stop being a nobody: "nobody is a nobody" and all about being social: he recommended having lunch with people you don't know: which is what I love doing at OSCON, meeting new people. Tim Mayer did a quick talk on <a href="http://minimalperl.com/">Minimal Perl</a>, via the country of Perlistan. Marvin Humphrey introduced us to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Search-Kinosearch/">Kinosearch</a>,
which I've played with and looks shiny. Will Whitaker talked about using Apache for building a traffic shaper ("Punish IE Users"!) for SMTP.
Grant McLean showed Perl prototypes used gratuitously (they don't do what you think they do). Ask BjÃÂ¸rn Hansen told us about <a href="https://www.bitcard.org/">bitcard</a>, the new shiny perl.org authentication system: "It works with Unicode because I want my name to work". Tak! Luke Closs and Neil Watkiss "talked" about juggling multiple languages - interpreted as juggling patterns! "C#, notice that this is just the basic with a lot more hand waving". Earl Cahill told us about <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI-Path/">CGI::Path</a>. Tim Chambers showed us ergonomic exercises for Emacs users (okay, really ergonomic key bindings). GONG!<br/><br/>
