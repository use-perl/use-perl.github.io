<p>Another early start this morning, with a morning of panicking about
finishing my slides. I went to "The Identity Function" (cute)
and "Dirty Stories About the Regex Engine (funny,
scary). "Programming Parrot" was not a joke after all, being about
using Perl in Python.

<p>

I rushed off to give my "Instant Compilers" talk (being a 20 minute
talk, it was more a quick overview of how to write a compiler in Perl
- my full one-hour talk at TPC will be much more comprehensive). Then
to the lightning talks, which were all excellent. Who needs a whole
twenty minutes anyway? I reckon we should reschedule all the
yapc::Europe talks to five minutes - it can only be more fun...

<p>

Gozer took me off to eat a "poutine" for lunch, a local specialty
which involves chips, gravy and curds. It was interesting, and very
filling indeed. I made it back in time for "Any2XML", which seemed
like a very silly way to munge data (the configuration file was
XML-like (yuck!), it wasn't actually XML, and the transformed data
wasn't normalised). I gave my pretty pictures talk, "Graphing Perl",
which seemed to go quite well, and then stayed for "Generation of
JavaScript in Perl CGI" (I decided <i>not</i> to look into a Perl
to JavaScript compiler...), before catching the end of the "Perl 6

Status Meeting" (I think I'd heard all the discussions before on the
mailing lists).

<p>

Damian's "The Conway Channel" showed us all the amazing and crazy
things he's been doing during his sponsored year, such as releasing a
module every week and all sorts of great Perl 6 work. I reckon he
was a good investment after all! ;-)<p>

It all ended up with thanks to and from the yapc::America team and a
book auction &agrave; la yapc::Europe (no, it wasn't the same without dumrats).

<p>

Dinner in a lovely French restaurant with Abigail. Latin
quarter. Beautiful people in the streets. Gozer's loft party
(wireless, stick insects, bath full of beer, excellent). No
sleep. CPAN/Modules BOF. Merguez sausages. P2P. Skud leading us around
old Montreal. Beer. Geek card games. Dancing in the rain. Blame
transfer protocol. Street performer: mmmm, flamey.  Slow thai
food. Katie Holmes. No sleep. Saying goodbye to everyone
again. Museums, shopping in the underground city, "Lara Croft: Tomb
Raider" (she's a star!), airport (no wireless), plane, jetlag, back in
London town, baby.

<p>

Yet another great YAPC! Many thanks to lenzo, lucs, mendel and
everyone else involved! Good talks, good people, good weather, good
beer, good community, good ideas. Good heavens, this writeup is
way too long. Goodbye.
