I could say a lot about it. Most of it is inconsistent. But mostly I will say that <a href="http://www.perl.org/">www.perl.org</a> needs a rewrite.<br/><br/>

... but I really don't.  He says the docs suck, when a great many people think they are great.  He submits two doc patches, and much of what is in the patches is incorrect or irrelevant.  He complains about the web sites because they are thriving (that is, too much concentrated effort into things that work!).  He complains that the VB community, which has much to humble about, has the "right amount" of humility.<br> <br>YAWN.

<p>I think the docs need to include a "How to fork politely" document to point discontented people at.  If they feel up to it and are unhappy enough, they can always fork.  If it looks better, they'll gain a following and pull an egcs.  If not -- well, I care about as much as you.</p>

<p>I'm still waiting for Rindalf.</p>

<p>a big to-do about a perl.org rewrite after TPC last year? Perhaps I'm confusing it with something else or the myriad of stuff that people get all excited about at TPC and then forget about a month later. I suppose this is where you suggest the colour orange and the number 6<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I did to a redesign of perl.org.  It was supposed to be released last year but hasn't been yet.  I'm not sure what the hold up is.

I've seen a preview of the new version and it looks good, so Robert, go ahead and release early<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

Thanks.  I'd like to work on content for some of the other sites, too.  Content and info architecture is a bigger issue than look&amp;feel when dealing with overlapping sites.

If you have any thoughts about datetime.perl.org or apprentice.perl.org feel free to tell me.  Those I can update on my own as needed.
