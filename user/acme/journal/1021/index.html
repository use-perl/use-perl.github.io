<p>This week I've mostly been flat searching. I also had a job interview. Yes, really.
<p>
I've been looking for a cool one-bedroom flat in Notting Hill / High Street Kensington in London. I've seen small, dark basement flats. I've seen tiny flats based around a staircase. I've seen studios with high walls. I've seen flats with a garden. I've seen flats on main roads (bus routes). I've seen flats in mews. I have seen a lot of flats. Up to now I've always thought of a couple thousand pounds as a lot of money - I hadn't really thought about
property being so expensive. $$$$$$$$$$!. Wouldn't I prefer five Porsches instead?
<p>
And I had a job interview. I find jobs are useful. They
somehow generate money, and money is useful for purchasing
things. The guy interviewing me kept on introducing me
as "Leon, a Perl God", which made me a little worried...
It seems like a cool place, though, and their website is orange! On the other hand, they failed to buy me lunch a Nobu... ;-)
<p>
I <i>was</i> going to write about the Copious Free Time Brigade, the lack of Perl jobs in London, and the ridiculously high number of unemployed Perl people I know. However, I have since had an interview (the first in months!) and am less worried. Maybe everything will turn out OK.
<p>
Yes, I've been doing Perl stuff. This JVM thing is taking longer than expected.
<p>
Some of the estate agents were <i>soooo cute!</i>...</p>
