<a href="http://www.railsconfeurope.com/">RailsConf Europe 2007</a> happened in Berlin earlier this week. Were you there? I wasn't, but luckily I can <a href="http://www.railsconfeurope.com/pub/w/61/presentations.html">check out the slides</a>. My highlights:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.railsconfeurope.com/presentations/railsconfeurope07/re7_olabini.pdf">JRuby on Rails at ThoughtWorks</a> (PDF) on why Ruby sucks and why JRuby works for them

<h2>No continuations?</h2>

Really?  If you had perl-on-random-VM and someone said "oh yeah, no continuations, sorry", what would be the point?  Half of CPAN wouldn't work.  Don't Ruby-programmers like continuations?

<p>Well but I've only recently started looking into Continuations in Perl, and that's after working in the language paid-full-time for 7 years. They're very slick and very cool, but not required to make working code that pays the bills and keeps the lights on.

</p><p>As for half of CPAN not working, I'm fairly certain more than Half of CPAN is not XS code. I bet in the Ruby world more than half their Gems don't use the C-API. All of that will run perfectly well. Besides it is early in their language's life-cycle. I'm sure Ruby 2.3 or whatever may come out with a solution so that a developer can write a C implementation and a Java implementation and a PIR implementation and everything will just sort itself out. If not, they'll figure out a different solution.

</p><p>I say more power to them porting to different backends, the more innovation the more things we can steal...er<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... borrow<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... later.</p>

<p>Are you confusing continuations with closures?</p>

Yes I am.  I blame Friday.
