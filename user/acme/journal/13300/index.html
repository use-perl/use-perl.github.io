<p>After last night's craziness we got up at a rather reasonable 9am, popped down for some muffins and OJ and headed off across town to meet sky and coral. They had found a nice cafe by the park (Market and Park) with free wireless and power. I may go back there again. We then met up with gnat and headed off to The Mac Store where we all gazed at the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight</a>. James and I snagged one, and we headed back for lunch, bumping into Casey.
<p>
Casey then dragged us into the Perl Bugathon, where I squashed lots of bugs and made a couple of parrot patches. It was surprisingly satisfying resolving those bugs. I then helped out Vee by being a guinea pig for the speaker registration process.
<p>
A lot of laptop hacking later on, and after doing a lot of laptop wireless tech support we decided to create a breakaway dinner plan and after walking through Chinatown we went to a steak place where I had a lovely rib eye for dinner.
<p>
[Insert minor scenes of drinking and meeting people here].
Then we got tired and headed home at 11pm. Sleep beckons, but tomorrow the conference starts for real...</p>

<p>really 'squashing' bugs or just closing a bunch of errant and old tickets that should have been done a while ago?</p>

Oh, ok, mostly we were just closing old tickets. "This was fixed in 5.8.0" and the like. But it's still a good thing...

<p>I wasn't complaining...I was just curious<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I'm sure Jarkko appreciates it quite a bit.</p>
