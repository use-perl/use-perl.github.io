<p>The Perl Foundation took part in Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of Code</a> program and managed to get <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/news/2005/googlesoc2.html">8 projects funded</a>. This is the fifth in a series of informal interviews finding out more information about these projects. Up now is Gary Jackson with "Extended Type Inference System for Perl 5".
<p>
<b>Hi there! Tell us a bit about yourself, including age, where you
are a student and what you are studying</b><br/>
I am 27 and studying Computer Science at the University of Maryland.  I'm a
degree-seeking graduate student after a five year hiatus from school.
<p>
<b>You've had a Google Summer of Code project funded. What will you be
doing? How will you be doing this? What's the final product?</b><br/>
I'm extending a type inference system for Perl 5 that I wrote this past
Spring to handle aggregate data types, objects, and type qualifiers (if time
allows).  The idea behind this project is to provide a tool to Perl
programmers who wish to use it, not to enforce some stuffy type system on
all Perl programmers.
<p>
<b>How did you get interested in this topic?</b><br/>
I took a graduate level programming languages course this past Fall, and I
took a language-based security class in the Spring.  I think some of the
tools and techiques we talked about in those classes could help make Perl
programs more robust.
<p>
<b>Where do you see your project going after this summer?</b><br/>
I plan on writing an academic paper about it and submitting it to
conferences and journals.  If this project is worthwhile, I could go a long
way with it.
<p>
<b>Is there any way to track your progress over the next few months?
Got a blog?</b><br/>
Not yet, but I'll get one soon.
<p>
<b>Did you expect to get funded?</b><br/>
Not really.  Mine was an eleventh-hour entry and a bit of a lark.  I
expected to hear some sort of feedback about my project, but heard none.
The acceptance letter was a complete surprise.
<p>
<b>Got a silly fact about yourself or the project?
</b><br/>
Everyone I tell about the project thinks I'm crazy.  To a certain extent,
they are right.  I do not believe that a sound type system can be written
for Perl 5 programs (at least, not useful Perl 5 programs).  However, I
still think that type inference techniques can catch some meaningful errors
at compile time.</p>
