I've just come back from the <a href="http://announce.londonpython.org.uk/2008/04/15/london-python-meetup-tuesday-may-the-5th/">London Python Meetup</a>. There was an informal survey, and I was the person who had the least Python experience (although I have written <a href="http://londonpmtech.appspot.com/"> a little app</a>). Around 50 people turned up and there was free pizza and beer.
</p>
<p>
There were some lightning talks, including one on 
<a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>. Another talk was a relevation someone has bought a bunch of servers for platform testing.
The lightning talks were a bit hit-and-miss and would have been much better if they hadn't tried to have slides.
</p>
<p>
The main talk was Jacob Kaplan-Moss giving details about the history of <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, mostly little anecdotes. I was surprised to hear that <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2008/about/">PyCon</a> had almost 1,100 people this year and that in the Django talk, half of the attendees (200 people) had learnt Python in order to use Django. That's some killer app.
</p>
<p>
Perl people as are pretty pragmatic, using the best tool for the job and learning about everything. However almost every talk tonight contained a dig about Perl, it was really dishearting. Python people: grow up and pay attention to what other people are doing - you might learn something.
