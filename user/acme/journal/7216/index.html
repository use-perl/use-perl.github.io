<div class="span8">
<p>This weekend is a bank holiday weekend (which means we get Monday off). It is also <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/carnival/">Carnival Weekend</a>. The Notting Hill Carnival is the largest street party in Europe, and hails from the Caribbean (Trinidad originally). It involves masquerade bands, floats, steel bands, static sound systems and live stages. Oh, and 1.5 million people. And I moved into a new flat this year and it goes down my street (Chepstow Road - you can see it on the route map).
<p>
Some people don't enjoy the carnival, and avoid it much as they avoid the tourists who go to Portobello Market on Saturday, but I enjoy the carnival. It makes a large area of London a no-car area, which is great. I enjoy the music. I enjoy the dancing. I enjoy the weird food stalls. It's a good laugh. I enjoyed it last year even though it rained.
<p>
I'm going to party on Sunday (Family day) and go mad on Monday (Party day). I'm hosting post-carnival drinks ingy-style (bath full of ice and beer) at my flat, which will either be crazy or quiet. Will I change my opinion of the carnival now it goes down my street? Maybe. It was kind of one of the attractions of getting this flat.
<p>
<i>Get back to yer roots, mon!</i></p>

<p>It's a lot like the people on St. Croix who live in Christiansted and disdain the semi-weekly Wednesday night carnival in Frederiksted [ where the cruise ships unload the hoi polloi ] by staying at home. I never considered moving to Frederikstead from Solitude Farm but I rode my bike into town  whenever I was around for it since you can have a good time in spite of or even because of the tourists<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Now all London needs is a little tropical weather and a few bartenders who can make some decent mai tais in little tiki glasses with umbrellas!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>



<h2>Memories</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vek/">vek</a> on 2002-08-22T15:51:59</h3>
Blimey, the things you remember.  I too remember having a bit of a laugh at the Notting Hill Carnival back in the day.  I seem to recall a fairly decent amount of beer was involved.  Must have been at least 10 years (or so) ago now.  <br> <br>Bloody hell, where does the time go??



<h2>A much smaller carnival in a much smaller city</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2002-08-24T20:13:25</h3>
I watched the Truro carnival today... much smaller - took about 30 minutes to go past - the highlight being 'Falmouth Marine Band' - a group of men who approach music in a typically cornich manner by ensuring they are sloshed before starting, in a very public place and well armed with lude jokes and oil drums as well as whatever outfit they reckon suits the occasion.
<p>
Its a shame that insurance and penny-pinching has reduced regional carnivals to such small affairs - I remember the village carnival in Budock (population of a couple of thousand) involved hundreds of walkers and a dozen trucks as well as smaller floats now Cornwalls largest carnival had only 3 lorries, a handful of cars and about 20 walkers. The 3 bands were good but still not as good as during the 80's when everybody took part.
