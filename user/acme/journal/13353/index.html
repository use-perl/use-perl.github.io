<p>The second day of the conference was a little hectic. I guess you all know by now, but during his keynote, Larry announced <a href="http://www.poniecode.org/">Ponie</a>. Fotango, the company James, Arthur and I work for, is very kindly giving Arthur three hours a day for the next two years to work on Ponie, aka Perl 5 on Parrot. This is the reason we've all be running around like headless chickens over the last week trying to organise all this. Many thanks to Fotango, Canon, and The Perl Foundation for making this work. I can see Arthur dragging me into Ponie development too ;-)
<p>
I skipped most of the tutorials, went to a wonderful little sushi place with Piers for lunch, enjoyed the p5p bof, really enjoyed the states of the onion/feather/elephant/more animals here, and liked the ActiveState party. Later on there were cocktails...
<p>
<i>Our Ponie tshirts have proved very popular indeed...</i></p>

<p>Assuming that <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme/journal/12912" title="perl.org">your owners</a perl.org> allow you. And my impression was that they wanted CPANTS, had towels, and were prepared to use them<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>Hey, well if they only work for THREE WHOLE HOURS every day on Ponie, just <i>think</i> of all the extra time they'll have left over for CPANTS! All this time I've been living with a man who does this stuff for 12 hours or more each day gripping his iBook when he could have just had 3 hours! He's just been surfing for p0rn for the other 9 or more hours. I knew it!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Jarkko's gonna get a talkin' to tonight, yessirree!</p>
