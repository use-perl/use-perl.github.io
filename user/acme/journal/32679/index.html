<div class="span8">
<p><p>I've just finished reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_Delusion">The God Delusion</a> by Richard Dawkins. The Wikipedia page summarises it very well. I highly recommend you read the book and see how truly terrible all religion is. 
</p>
<p>
The crucial argument for me is that people believe what their parents and religious teachers teach them. If you are religious and believe in one particular religion, it is just because you happened to be born then and there - your religion is not the only one and you would have had another religion if you were born somewhere else. So stop having blind faith and stop indoctrinating your children and stop harassing everyone else and stop insulting and killing other people.
</p>
<p>
From now on read "ethnic cleansing" as "religious cleansing" and cringe whenever anyone says "Christian child". It's time to go on the offensive. Just say no to religion.

In school we had Religious Studies (only about the bible), put on plays based on biblical stories and had Latin prayers twice a week in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>.

The unfortunate thing is that Dawkins doesn't understand his subject well enough to write an essay, let alone a book.  He has extremely little understanding of religion in general, or Christianity in particular.  Most of his attacks are straw men or red herrings or question-begging or simple ad hominem.  acme wrote:<p><div class="quote">If you are religious and believe in one particular religion, it is just because you happened to be born then and there - your religion is not the only one and you would have had another religion if you were born somewhere else.</div> Except, of course, that this is a very illogical argument.  One may wish to think that there is not one correct religion, but even if that's the case, this wouldn't be evidence of it, at all.<p><div class="quote">So stop having blind faith and stop indoctrinating your children</div> My faith has never been blind, and there is no logical difference between me "indoctrinating" my children with Christianity, and you "indoctrinating" your children with atheism, unless you are going to assume -- without evidence, as none has been provided, either here, or in Dawkins' book -- that Christianity is somehow objectively bad or that atheism is objectively good.<p><div class="quote">and stop harassing everyone else and stop insulting and killing other people.</div> I harass no one with my religion.  It is you, acme, who are being insulting here.  And as to killing, most of it in the last century -- the bloodiest century ever -- was done by atheist (or at least anti-religious) regimes, including in Germany, the USSR, and China.<p><div class="quote">From now on read "ethnic cleansing" as "religious cleansing" and cringe whenever anyone says "Christian child". It's time to go on the offensive.</div> I quote you at you, acme: stop harassing and insulting other people.<br><br>acme, I don't want to offend you, but you are so completely off base that it saddens me.  As a European, you should know damned well -- better than any silly American -- that lots of people have lots of different views and beliefs, and that this will never change.  You imply that you want peace, but the only way to get it in our necessarily pluralistic society is through tolerance, and you are, unfortunately, acting like the poster boy for intolerance.<br><br>I agree with you that religious people can offend, can do bad things.  So what?  That is not an indictment of religion as much as it is an indictment of humanity, of mobs, of groups of people.<br><br>I suggest you read <a href="http://federali.st/10" title="federali.st">Federalist #10</a federali.st>.  The cure for the ills you see is not less freedom, less religion, less alternative views.  The cure is a society that respects and defends individual liberties, including (especially) those of minorities in the society.<br>

<p><blockquote><div>The unfortunate thing is that Dawkins doesn't understand his subject well enough to write an essay, let alone a book.</div></blockquote>

<p>I've got to say that if so, it truly is unfortunate.  I want to see the decent arguments against religion.  Maybe I should check out The Blind Watchmaker, instead.  As I said in my previous post, it sounds like Dawkins is interested in rectifying thousands of years of violation of liberty on the part of religious people by now violating the liberty of other religious people, people who are not responsible for the sins of their ancestors.</p>

<p>It truly is unfortunate when someone claims to make a contribution to this great conversation and then fails to, whether that person be religious, atheist, or what have you.  Thousands of years to get to the point where we can discuss such things without killing each other, millions of people dead to buy the privilege<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... and we exercise the privilege by sticking our fingers in our ears and not listening to each other.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(  I certainly defend people's right to not have such a discussion if they don't want to.  But to claim to want to participate and then not actually address what the other side says is a tragedy.</p>

<p>For the record, and for anyone who's interested, I have personally condemned "blind faith" from the pulpit on a number of occasions.  And I've even been condemned by at least one crotchety old religious lady for doing so, albeit in another medium (religious talk radio).</p>

<p>As for killing, the number one killer in the past century was government.  I doubt anybody in this conversation but me would use this as a case for outlawing government.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I haven't yet read the book but I intend to.  Thanks for recommending it.<br><br>"I highly recommend you read the book and see how truly terrible all religion is."<br><br>Q:  Can you please define religion in this context?<br><br>"If you are religious and believe in one particular religion, it is just because you happened to be born then and there - your religion is not the only one and you would have had another religion if you were born somewhere else."<br><br>This plain just not apply to me.  There were no friends or family growing up that come remotely close to fitting your description - I'm the only one.  While I have always been either agnostic or a believer in something I couldn't define but called God, it wasn't until after I did a comparative theology study and attended services at dozens of different ones (both Christian and non-Christian) that I decided what I would believe.  In fact, what I believe is often in conflict with what other "religious" people believe and is constantly involving as I learn and think.<br><br>Q:  Do you honestly believe it is not possible to come to belief in God, by whatever definition, by any sound rational process?<br><br>"So stop having blind faith and stop indoctrinating your children and stop harassing everyone else and stop insulting and killing other people."<br><br>Q:  Does your statement concerning children extend to Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy?  Does it include anything not based in fact and science?  I ask because it seems like this would be an incredibly effective way at stifling creativity and imagination.  Presumably you only mean "religion" but I would like to clarify.<br><br>From now on read "ethnic cleansing" as "religious cleansing" and cringe whenever anyone says "Christian child".<br><br>While my daughter is not old enough to stay home by herself, she will go to church when I go.  As soon as she is old enough to stay home it will be her decision to go to Church or not.  I will never tell my daughter that "Adam and Eve are the truth" and "Evolution is evil and wrong".<br><br>Q:  Why does "Christian Child" mean to you that makes you want to cringe?  Obviously it carries more weight then just the two word label.<br><br>"Please read the book and enjoy Dave's writings - I particularly enjoyed Worthless Religions."<br><br>I plan to.

<p>Man, there ought to be a law.</p> <p><blockquote><div>The crucial argument for me is that people believe what their parents and religious teachers teach them.</div></blockquote>

<p>I haven't read this book, but the reason I haven't and likely won't is due to time constraints rather than just not wanting to read it.  But surely Dawkins has something more intelligent to say than this?  Because it's simply not universally true.  I'll freely concede that for something like 98% of all people in history this is true.  But what about the 2% or so for whom it is not?  Moreover, what about cases where new religions have formed?  Why did the first Christians become Christians?  Why did the first Muslims become Muslims?  This "everybody is just a part of their parents' religion" idea allows only for gradual shift and evolution in religion.  It doesn't explain sudden changes at all.  And really I've got to say it's the kind of juvenile thing I used to hear in secondary school.</p>

<p>I can think of better reasons not to be religious than this idea.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Reading the Wikipedia summary makes me want to take a look at the book, and my library has a copy, so I may do just that within the next year or so.  But looking at the summary of each chapter I'm not seeing much there that meaningfully challenges my faith.  I am, however, wishing that Dawkins would at least adhere to the basic morality of the Wiccan rede: "An it harm noone, do what you will."  I stand <i>with</i> Dawkins in asserting that one does <i>not</i> need religion to be good and moral (and I hope that my citation of a Wiccan belief makes clear I don't think Christianity has a monopoly on the subject), and I stand <i>with</i> Dawkins in roundly condemning all special legal privileges that have been granted to those who hold certain beliefs (and I don't believe in drawing a legal distinction between religious beliefs and any other)<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but what is not clear is if Dawkins honors my right to believe something that is, in his opinion, quite possibly <i>wrong</i>.  On that basis, he sounds just like the religious people he is condemning, and all of them appear to be guilty of the <i>sin</i> of desiring to violate the liberty of others.  However, there's not enough in the article to see for sure what Dawkins thinks about this, so I may be misunderstanding.</p>

I think this is more of a soundbite than the crux of the argument.<br><br>Religions conflict. You can't believe in Zeus and the Christian God. Heck, even some Catholics believe that Protestants are kidding themselves.<br><br>So the point is really about which religion do you pick? Since there is no empirical evidence for <i>any</i> religion, it really doesn't matter which you pick, and that's enough evidence for Dawkins (and myself) that religion is just a crock of manure.<br><br>It's just that most people don't pick their religion. They don't choose something that best fits their world view, they just follow the path of what's around them (and by that I mean usually their parents, or if they marry someone of another religion they may choose that one, or if they have a lot of friends in one religion they are likely to choose that one, etc).

<p><div class="quote">Art is a good example here, because those who consider themselves experts on art tend to recognise that appreciation of art is very subjective.</div> It is very subjective, but not wholly so.  But subjective is not the opposite of empirical.  You can have objective truth that is not empirical, such as mathematical truths which are more philosophical than empirical.<br><br>You simply cannot say that because there is no empirical standard, that therefore none is better than another.  Otherwise, we can say that a philosophy that says killing babies for fun is no worse than a philosophy that says all killing is wrong, and I don't think you really want to go down that road, especially since your primary offense here is that people push their views on you, which is not empirically definable as an offense.<br><br>I agree with you that it is wrong, but we cannot say so empirically.  We say so philosophically.  Whether that philosophical conclusion is objective or subjective is another matter, but also probably beside the point.<p><div class="quote">What Dawkins and I object to is the lack of subjectiveness in religion - the "If you don't believe in this you will go to hell" attitude.</div> Fine, you can object to that attitude, but you cannot rationally say that everyone who has that belief is wrong.

A person can be morally wrong in how they act, but still be (theoretically) correct in their view.<p><div class="quote">Dawkins' soundbites tend to paint everyone with the same brush</div> Not just his soundbites, but his actual full text, too.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p><div class="quote">If you read the book you'll realise that Dawkins isn't saying you shouldn't practice religion, just don't foist it on other people</div> That's simply not true.

And so on.<br><br>True, his main point is about keeping it to yourself and not pushing it on others, and he will often later come back and say "I am not necessarily saying this about all religious beliefs" even though he already said it about all religious beliefs.  Frankly, he is an extremely sloppy thinker and/or writer on this subject.<br><br>And not to attack acme, but just above we have another example of this.  He wrote "Just say no to religion."  True, that was in the context of a larger point about pushing religion on others, so I don't know exactly what he meant, which is part of the problem.<p><div class="quote">and more importantly don't make non-believers feel like they shouldn't be allowed to exist.</div> No one could agree with that statement more than me (and, frankly, more than anyone follows the Bible, which I believe clearly teaches that Christians are not any better than anyone else).  I believe with no reservations and with everything I do and say and think and feel that everyone of every religion has a right to do and say and think and feel however they do, up until that point where they harm someone else (which is, of course, a difficult enough subject on its own).<br><br>Many of us Christians have fought long and hard, and even convinced many of our fellow Christians, to act differently (read: nicer) toward non-Christians.

That's the point - there is no "atheist characteristic" - we're not an organisation. However there are plenty of good charitable organisations that aren't tied to religion. You seemed to be trying to say that there weren't.

<p>You're not hypocritical; just dealing with two definitions of tolerance.  You're consistently pushing the belief that you don't think people should use force (whether on their own, or through government) to restrict the rights of others based on their beliefs.

For example:<p><blockquote><div>DAWKINS: People who believe in God conclude there must have been a divine knob twiddler who twiddled the knobs of these half-dozen constants to get them exactly right. The problem is that this says, because something is vastly improbable, we need a God to explain it. But that God himself would be even more improbable.</div></blockquote><br><br>There is, of course, no scientific basis for saying that God himself would be even more improbable.  He can only make that statement by question-begging his hypothesis.<p><blockquote><div>Physicists have come up with other explanations. One is to say that these six constants are not free to vary. Some unified theory will eventually show that they are as locked in as the circumference and the diameter of a circle. That reduces the odds of them all independently just happening to fit the bill.</div></blockquote><br><br>Of course, there is, in fact, even less evidence -- scientific or philosophical -- evidence for this theory than there is for the existence of God.  It's a nice thing to wonder about, but there is absolutely nothing to back it up.<p><blockquote><div>The other way is the multiverse way. That says that maybe the universe we are in is one of a very large number of universes. The vast majority will not contain life because they have the wrong gravitational constant or the wrong this constant or that constant. But as the number of universes climbs, the odds mount that a tiny minority of universes will have the right fine-tuning.</div></blockquote><br><br>And this also not only has absolutely no evidence to back it up, it is far less probable, from where I sit, than the existence of God, or even that these six constants all aligned by chance.  That is, he is using this argument to rescue the six constants from improbability by appealing to something even less probable, which is what he says Christians do by appealing to God.<br><br>IOW, Collins is precisely right to invoke Occam's Razor against the notion.  And Dawkins' repeated use of the phrase "cop-out" is ironic since it applies at least equally well to his multiverse hypothesis.  Dawkins might respond, "but I am not saying that it is THE answer, as people of faith do."  No, but he is saying that God is a less reasonable answer than his multiverse hypothesis, but that conclusion is question-begging.<br><br>The bottom line is that Dawkins, as Collins says, rules anything outside of nature out of the conversation, and this itself is irrational.  Collins does an excellent job of showing Dawkins to be simply irrational, out on a vendetta against what he sees as fundamentalist Christianity, such as in this obviously false statement that betrays a stunning ignorance of the history of Dawkins' own profession:<p><blockquote><div>Once you buy into the position of faith, then suddenly you find yourself losing all of your natural skepticism and your scientific--really scientific--credibility. I'm sorry to be so blunt.</div></blockquote><br><br>I am sorry that he thinks that's true.  Newton, the most important scientific figure in history at least through the 19th century, was scientifically curious largely <b>because</b> of his religious faith, as has been well-documented.<br><br>It's a great example of where Dawkins is apparently incapable of separating the negative manifestations of religious belief in some people, and religious belief itself.  In those cases where faith is used to prevent scientific study by just copping out and saying "God did it," he is right to criticize, but that is not -- as clearly proven by Newton and Collins -- a reasonable criticism of religion itself, of "faith."<br><br>Religion does not necessarily lead to closed-mindedness, and sometimes leads to precisely the opposite.  Religion does not necessarily lead to intolerance, and sometimes leads to precisely the opposite.<br><br>And you can't get him off the hook by saying "well, he really means fundamentalism," because I am a fundamentalist.  I was a fundamentalist before most of you had ever heard of the word.  And yet I am as open-minded and tolerant as pretty much anyone you probably know.  (Now, when I say open-minded, I don't mean I will accept anything as valid, but I will honestly <b>consider</b> nearly anything -- including the nonexistence of God -- which is what the phrase means.)  Yes, he probably means some other definition of "fundamentalist," but that's the main problem here: he redefines words and phrases and religious belief itself to suit his agenda, as seen in his straw man attacks against a definition of God that hardly anyone, if anyone, actually believes in (such as his silly attacks on a God that presuppose a constraint by linear time).<br><br>Some people just should not write outside their area of expertise.  For example, Paul Krugman of the NY Times is a very smart economics writer, but on politics, he is among the worst: he simply does not really understand politics very well (e.g., his recent attack on Bush in the US Attorney "scandal" where he said that it was a ploy to create a permanent hold on power was nonsensical on its face, since the last Democrat to take power [Clinton] fired every US Attorney, and the next one could do the same).<br><br>And Dawkins is like that.  He's a great writer when it comes to explaining and defending evolutionary theory, and he has done a service to society in that role.  But he really does not have a good mind for this theology stuff.  His writings also make me think he is not very good at philosophy, but that may be more of a blinder caused by his biases than actual incapacity.<br>

<p>This is an ad hominem fallacy.  I emphasize that its a fallacy because it's a flaw in logic.  Maybe it does make you "lose credibility."

<p>I agree.  Credibility factors in when you answer questions like "Is it worth attempting to repeat this experiment in the first place, or do I just think it's a pack of lies?"  Say, for example, trying to replicate the effect Alex Chiu gets from his rings.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I gave up on Dawkins a coupla years ago.  He repeats himself far too much.  If he can't come up with anything new, he should keep his mouth shut.  But I suppose regurgitating much the same thing over and over again to his followers is profitable.  It works for the god-squad publishers, after all.  The same criticism, of course, also applies to every single person who has ever preached at me after my 8th-ish birthday.

</p><p>But unlike at least *some* of those foolish preachers, Dawkins is also annoyingly shrill.

</p><p>And for someone else who asked "Do you honestly believe it is not possible to come to belief in God, by whatever definition, by any sound rational process?" - my answer has to be no, for all versions of god that have so far been posited to me.  Atheism, on the other hand (and please don't make the mistake of confusing it with antitheism) is entirely rational.  In the absence of evidence for something's existence, not professing belief is the only sensible position.</p>

I would be willing to present a rational case, though I am not entirely sure you would be willing to consider it.<br><br>I could give you a quick overview of a sound rational process.  Whatever begins to exist has a cause.  The universe began to exist.  Therefore, it had a cause.  It would not be possible for that cause to be an impersonal agent, so that cause must have been personal.<br><br>That the universe began to exist is clearly true.  It could not have always existed.  The Second Law of Thermodynamics tells us the universe would be in a cold death because of entropy, otherwise.  Even if not, we know that we cannot traverse an infinite: you cannot ever get from an infinite time in the past to now, so therefore there never was an infinite time in the past.<br><br>So then we get to the stickier part of the argument: OK, so what caused it?  Through sound, rational examination, I believe this Uncaused Cause was a personal being, "God."<br><br>Basically, it boils down to this: if the Uncaused Cause were impersonal, then there's no way to posit how it could have caused the universe.  Assuming this cause doesn't change (else we would have to then ask, what caused THAT change?, which leads us back to where we started), we have to assume it is therefore sufficient, on its own, to create the universe.  And if that is the case, then the cause cannot exist without the effect (since no change happens), which means that the universe was caused to exist as soon as the cause did; but the cause is outside of time, and the universe has not always existed, which leads us to an apparently unresolvable paradox.<br><br>The most plausible resolution to this paradox is that the agent was personal.  A personal agent can create the universe without any prior existing conditions.  And that personal agent is God.  Or the FSM.  Doesn't matter.<br><br>You don't have to believe it, of course.  But it is sound, and it is rational.  Surely there may be other explanations, but it would be a cop-out to say that, pace Dawkins, my view is a cop-out.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  I daresay there's far more evidence for my view here that God exists, than there is for Dawkins' multiverse theory (which Hawking has also strongly pushed: quantum theory applied to universes, every possible universe existing, and this one being the "evolutionary" result; it makes for interesting science fiction, but it is not supportable by any physical or philosophical evidence, and it still doesn't answer the question of the First Cause).<p><div class="quote">Atheism, on the other hand (and please don't make the mistake of confusing it with antitheism) is entirely rational.

<p>For the record, that very argument used to be a very interesting, very protracted edit war on Wikipedia's Atheism article.  Haven't looked at it in a long time, so I wonder how it came out.</p>

I don't really care, except a. I am annoyed for purely laziness reasons that the definition has been changing among some groups of people, because it is just extra work for the rest of us, and b. I am annoyed that people act like *I* am the one with the problem, for using the older and more common definition.

I've got an OED and I'm not afraid to use it!

<p>It defines atheism as "disbelief in *or* denial of the existence of a god", and it has citations which I think support my position from at least 1568 (I'd have to look them up in context to be sure, and I can't be bothered).  I think that's pretty long-standing.  Those causing the confusion are those who use the same word to mean two radically different things.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, I remember the story of the martyrdom of an early Christian, where he was instructed while on trial to denounce Christians by saying "away with the atheists."  At that point, Christians were "atheists," because they denied "the" gods (Zeus, etc.).  The martyr responded by pointing at his persecutors and saying, "Away with the atheists."</p>

That is the primary use of the word now, as it has been for a long time, and it's not a mistake to use the word with that meaning.<br>

Ah, fair enough.  Here in Rightpondia, I can't recall ever meeting someone who thought that atheism didn't cover mere non-belief.

I have come across your argument based on what created the universe before.  The big problem I have with it is that physical laws, such as effects having causes, are properties of our universe, and so projecting them backward beyond the beginning of our universe is<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... dubious.
