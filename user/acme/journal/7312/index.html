<p>Well, the Children's Day at the carnival yesterday <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2215918.stm">went well</a>. A couple hundred thousand people went down my street. It was nice and sunny. We met up with a group of people around midday and followed floats, taking well deserved breaks at people's flats along the way for more beer and the toilet. I somehow got everyone to eat goat curry (quite nice, but hey it's a curry, all you can taste is the chillies and stuff). We danced, we partied, we ate weird food. It was great. We ended up in someone's flat, watched <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0106611">Cool Runnings</a> which was a lot of fun, and stumbled back home getting ready for today, the main day of the carnival. It's less sunny, but about 1.5 million people are coming today. It's already quite loud, but I have lots of ice and beer so I'm all set.
<p>
[Many thanks to James for heading off to Germany and kindly letting me party. I would have loved to go]</p>
