<div class="span8">
<p>Yesterday evening, after a total of six hours of hacking, I released <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/LBROCARD/CPAN-WWW-Testers/">CPAN::WWW::Testers</a>, which downloads and presents CPAN Testers data. From the docs:
<blockquote>
CPAN Testers is really a mailing list with a web interface, testers.cpan.org. testers.cpan.org was painfully slow. I happened to be doing metadata stuff for Module::CPANTS. This is the result. It's alpha code, but using it anyone can host their CPAN Testers website.
</blockquote>
<p>
Actually, I've just checked it this morning and testers.cpan.org is still horribly slow. Getting all the distributions which begin with 'A' takes 50 seconds for <a href="http://testers.cpan.org/search?request=by-dist&letter=A">testers.cpan.org</a>
and 0.4 seconds for <a href="http://testers.astray.com/letter/A.html">testers.astray.com</a>.
This is because I generate static files.
<p>
Actually implementing it was fun. The turning point where everything suddenly started being clear was realising that testers.cpan.org was really an interface to the NNTP archive of the cpan-testers mailing list. The rest was done using Net::NNTP, Email::Simple, caching, DBD::SQLite, Sort::Versions and the Template::Toolkit.
<p>
It obviously needs a little design work and some computer-readable way of reading results. Anyone got some spare time?
<p>
<i>Phew, that's secret project number one down...</i></p>

<h2>Freaky coincidence</h2>

I was also fed up with testers.cpan.org, so I did <a href="http://dellah.org/testers/" title="dellah.org">dellah.org/testers</a dellah.org>.<br> <br>There's one program that is cronned to fetch update via nntp and stuff them in an SQLite. However I still present them dynamically via Mason and a badly configured mod_perl. And it's still faster than testers.cpan.org. I do point people to nntp.perl.org rather than mirror the bodies of all the tests.<br> <br>Mine was deliberately made to look much like testers.cpan =)<br> <br>As a side effect: <a href="http://dellah.org/testers/image.png" title="dellah.org">a picture of uploads per day</a dellah.org>.

<p>WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) If you'd like to take Acme's module and give it that interface I have a Sparc in London you can host it on<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) pretty please?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<a href="http://testers.astray.com/show/Data-Dumper.html" title="astray.com">This</a astray.com> doesn't seem correct to me (2.12_xx comes before 2.101).

Also there is something wrong with number of passed and failed tests:<blockquote><div> <tt>2.12_02 (5 FAILs, 4 PASSes)<br>96696 PASS sun4-solaris<br>96761 PASS MSWin32-x86-multi-thread<br> <br>2.12_01 (6 FAILs, 5 PASSes)<br>95765 PASS sun4-solaris<br>96190 FAIL MSWin32-x86-multi-thread</tt> </div></blockquote>

<h3><a href="/user/acme/">acme</a> on 2003-08-04T23:34:02</h3>
I'm using Sort::Versions in reverse mode, so most recent comes up top. According to Sort::Versions (and it seems right to me too), 2.101 is after 2.12.

It is wrong. Version numbers of Perl modules are compared as floats. So 2.12 should come after 2.101.

[sound of leon rustling around in perlmod, then perlmodstyle]<br/><br/>Oh, you're right. Fixed, thanks.
