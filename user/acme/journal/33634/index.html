<p>I administer one of the nodes of the <a href="http://www.irc.perl.org/">irc.perl.org</a> IRC network. I was the first European node - we now have
6 servers and many hundreds of users. It's always been terribly easy to admin the IRC server (nice and small network you see) but we're increasingly getting people who want to spam or take over channels. Take this morning on #perl for example:

<p>
I'm in two minds about this. Mini me number one is saying that it's useful and we should keep on trying to make it work. Mini me number two is saying that this is a problem because IRC (like SMTP) was never created with spam in mind (and thus to be robust in the face of attack) and we should just give up on IRC. Are there any decent, robust alternatives?

<p>To me, irc has always been like that, and that's why most channels have bots which enforce the bans and rules...</p>
<p>There have been initiatives to create a "more secure" irc protocol, but I'm unaware of any protocol based on the "channel" concept that gained acceptance except irc. All the new-fangled things are based on direct communication and not channels (and Jabber is one of those, right?).</p>



<h2>IRC+ (IRC spam)</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Corion/">Corion</a> on 2007-06-29T12:51:07</h3>
<p>Coincidentially, there is the launch of <a href="http://www.irc-plus.org/" title="irc-plus.org">IRC +</a irc-plus.org>, a new standard for IRC services that is geared towards scripting, but still backwards compatible with irc clients.</p>

The same person is simultaneously attacking Perl channels (in particul #perl6) on FreeNode with far more vicious messages than the one you printed.<br>
