<p> <div>As the new London.pm leader, I have some plans. Most of those involve believing that London.pm can be a huge force for good in this world. So far, the first plan to come to fruition is a refresh of the <a href="http://london.pm.org/">the London.pm website</a> by Andy Wardley. It has more content, it has a pleasing London skyline, it has a silly tagline and it is more orange. Thanks Andy!<br /></div></p>

<blockquote><div><p> <i>and it is more orange</i></p></div> </blockquote><p>As far as I'm concerned, the best thing is the controls on the right which mean that it doesn't need to be orange<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>Ditto. Not that I don't like orange but I do very much prefer blue.</p><p>Can we have some nice shiny "glass onion" buttons so we can link to the web site in a very Web 1.0 way?</p>

Good luck trying to convince TPF otherwise.

<p>That isn't as difficult as you make it sound. TPF are very accommodating to distinct uses of the logo that will help promote Perl, the user community, etc. For example the Birmingham Perl  Mongers logo, and several others around the world too.
</p><p>I think if Andy was able to incorporate a London landmark into the background or add wording that would uniquely identify it with London.pm, then I expect TPF would be happy with that. It is a fantastic logo, so it would be a shame not to be able to use it in some fashion.</p>

<p>They were okay about giving Perl is Alive permission to use a very similar onion-based logo actually  (also the work of Mr Wardley).  Using an onion 'button' as a link to another site would presumably just require that site to have the logo blurb on it somewhere - which it already does.
