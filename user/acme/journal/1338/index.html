<p>It's quite weird, but davorg is stepping down from leader of London.pm. I think he must have got tired of all of us or something. Anyway, being a democratically-minded bunch, he's organising an election for the next leader of London.pm. The rules were quite strict (nominees must be current members of the group by having posted to the list, and must be nominated by a least 5 people) and nominations closed today at midday.
<p>
We have a technical meeting tonight, where he'll announce the candidates. It'll be quite interesting, as he has already let out that: "a total of six people were nominated,
however four of them didn't get the required number of nominations (one,
unfortunately, had four, the other three all had only one each).".
