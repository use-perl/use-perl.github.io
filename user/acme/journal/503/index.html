The second day of tutorials was a bit calmer and also more hectic, as
I spent most of my time in the
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_speakerroom.jpg">speaker room</a>
finishing my slides for the following day. I managed to sit in at
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_andy2.jpg">Andy's</a>
Template Toolkit talk for a bit, which was excellent.
<p>
The highlight of the evening was
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_larry.jpg">Larry's</a>
State of the Onion speech, which he did in lightning talk style with
55 seconds a
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_state_slide.jpg">slide</a>.
He has some wonderful ideas of course, wait for
lathos' writeup for more details. The
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_state_crowd.jpg">crowd</a>
was huge.
<p>
I received (along with davorg to represent the people not present) a
Perl Mongers
<a href="http://www.perl.org/advocacy/white_camels.shtml">White Camel</a>
award for the good things I've done for the Perl community by organising
<a href="http://yapc.org/Europe/">YAPC::Europe</a> last year. It rocked.
<p>
Jon hosted the Internet
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_quiz.jpg">Quiz Show</a>,
which was
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_quiz_slide.jpg">terribly amusing</a>
at times. I participated as part of the London.pm team, known as
"The President's Dog" due to the fact that we lost the quiz last year
based on not knowing the name of... yes, the president's dog. We did our
<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/kids/pets.html">research</a>
this year, and Jon had some extra British questions in the quiz just for
us. We did quite well (thanks to Andy), the highlight being the Internet
worm question.
<p>
Jon asked the team leader to pick a team member, and davorg picked
me. The second question was to guess what the next question would be, given
that it would involve the same topic as the original question about the
internet worms. We correctly guessed that he would ask me to eat worms,
and he produced various flavoured dried worms (provided by gnat - I
love you man!).
I had the BBQ flavour. They were kind of crunchy.
<p>
It was fun. We then retired to the
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_beer2.jpg">bar</a>, trying
to convert a Java programmer to Perl and talking about all sorts of crazy
things. I believe I may have talked to Perrin about what the best templating
system was. Flame away! ;-)
<p>
The conference starts for real on Wednesday. It's gonna be fun.
