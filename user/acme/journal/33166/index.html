<p>Amazon has announced <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s3/">new pricing</a> for its S3 service. It's long been a complaint that fixed pricing is a pain when you scale really high, and they have introduced a tiered service so that data transfer is cheaper as you transfer more. However they have also introduced a per-request charge, which <a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?threadID=14979">punishes users serving small files</a>. This is probably a response to <a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?threadID=14978">"infinite disks"</a> based on S3. It's nice that they've dropped data transfer a little bit, but isn't storage also cheaper since they released S3 a year ago?
Anyway, the fall of the dollar is making this much cheaper for me than the new pricing is ;-)</p>

Google keeps leading me to Astray. And Astray keeps leading me astray. And somehow I seem to track you down like the unemployed goofy American insomniac that I am.
So, All I want to say this time is this. . .
Spelt is a kind of wheat and it does in fact contain gluten. Some gluten sensitive people might be okay with spelt. Celiacs however should avoid this grain. I would give you the wikipedia link on spelt but I'm just too damn tired to find it again. Sincerely, Ms. Goto aka the woman who made moosewood muffins with 5.5 cups of flour, thank you very much.
