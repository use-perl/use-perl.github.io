<p>This weekend there are an amazing number of Perl people in London town. It all started on Thursday, with Ingy, Schuyler, Jos and Ann turning up at the Fotango offices in the afternoon. We soon headed off to the London.pm social in The Star, a lovely pub in Belgravia. It was a very packed meeting, with lots of lovely people and Perl pumpkins and CPAN people and people from afar just here to go out drinking with us. London.pm were in form in every way and there was lots of partying and scheming of crazy plans. Oh, and a little drinking.
<p>
Jos is staying with me, so we did brunch, sushi, and then headed to the pub with Nicholas and Rafael to sketch our little plans for CPAN. After that, Fotango threw a dinner at a restaurant called Porters (geddit?) where Tim was thoroughly unimpressed with the number of DBI requests we performed per second. Then the Bergmans made us cocktails and forced us stay up late, damn them ;-)
<p>
After very little sleep, I somehow herded the cats and we're currently discussing CPAN. All your favourite topics would have come up, with metadata being the biggie. We'll post a report soon. <i>More importantly, it's time for the beer track again!</i></p>
