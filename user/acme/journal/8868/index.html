<p><i>Zip-Ah-Dee-Doo-Dah. Zip-Ah-Dee-Ay. My oh my, what a wonderful day...</i> Well, I'm back from lovely sunny Disneyworld and humming lots of Disney songs.
<p>
Highlights included: Having lunch in the Cinderella's castle, realising that Winnie is bigger than Mickey thesedays, Blizzard Bleach, the sun, the Tower of Terror, Rock and Rollercoaster, American-size food, all the kids shows, Pleasure Island, Extra TERRORestrial Alien Encounter, some random geek recognising my copyleft tshirt, and, well, everything else. It was a great holiday in the sun and I got to act like I was 12.
<p>
Got back to London and of course it's raining. As I learnt in the Who Wants To Be A Millionaire show, NYC has twice the amount of annual rainfall as London. Ha! Oh, and it's cold. But in interesting news, London.pm leader elections are in full swing, with all nominations in in in.
<p>
<i>Hmmm, I act like I'm 12 anyway...</i></p>

Stop that right this minute young man and go to your room.  And you'd better not even be thinging of coming out until you've got a working Java compiler for Parrot let me tell you.

<p>

Why if your London.pm leader was here right now he'd give you what for.  And you know how bitter he's been of late, why do you want to go working him up like that?  And what's this you're running on your computer?  Mac OS X?  You know your London.pm leader won't cope for any of this post Max OS 9 stuff.

</p><p>

I honestly don't know what to do with you these days.</p>
