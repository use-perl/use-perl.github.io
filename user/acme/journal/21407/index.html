<div class="span8">
<p>Recently I've been getting a bit more annoyed with computers. Some of this may have been my fault. I have a wonderful little <a href="http://www.lacie.com/products/product.htm?id=10029">external firewire 250G HD</a>. It was working fine, until I knocked it over.
Now it's making evil scraping and whining noises and is effectively dead.
Example two: a server's disk died at Fotango and we didn't have a development environment for a day.
<p>
I don't understand why computers die. I don't understand why computers are so complicated. I don't understand why computers aren't redundant.
From now on, everything I buy will be redundant. <b>Everything</b>. It's utterly stupid not to.
<p>
Also, I've been having a bit of a crisis of faith in the software industry (all too complicated, too many wheels reinvented, not enough actual Getting Stuff Done). So from next week I will be a person with copious free time. Plan is to do some cookery courses, a little pottery, travel a little, and maybe become a scuba instructor.

<h2>Solid State</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/schwern/">schwern</a> on 2004-10-19T20:58:02</h3>
The problem with technology is all the moving parts.  What fails on a computer?  The hard drive.  The fans.  The CD/DVD ROM drive.  Bearings wear out.  Heads crash.  Things get bent.  Dust gets in places dust should not be.<br> <br>Someday, hopefully soon, things like FlashROM will get fast enough and cheap enough that hard drives and dvds will go away and cheap read-write storage will finally be solid state.<br> <br>Someday, hopefully soon, CPU manufacturers will take a short haitus from the endless pursuit of making processors faster and faster so we can all play Extreme Unreal Doom Tournament Skate Park 2009 at 1600x1200 50fps and instead spend a few moments making them draw less power, generate less heat, be less polluting and, here's the kicker, not require any more damned fans.<br> <br>Until then, suffering.



<h2>Redundancy</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2004-10-19T22:15:53</h3>
Yeah, I lost my big old HD with all my MP3s etc. on it.  I recently reripped all my MP3s and now I have two 250GB drives and am backing everything up, essentially, including my 130GB music collection (mostly in Apple Lossless).  I plan to get two more 250GB and software RAID them to make redundancy simpler (in a few months).



<h2>For me:  Back to school, and Ptolemy</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cogent/">cogent</a> on 2004-10-20T05:43:03</h3>
<p>
This happened to me at right about this time last year.  I applied to a job in California (Rent.com, working with Ben Tilly), and realized (after what I thought was a pretty good interview) that I didn't want the job.  And I didn't know why.  The team was good (working with Tilly sounded really great), the product was okay if a bit unglamorous, they were profitable (always a plus for corporate culture), and it would've been in Santa Monica, where I'd wanted to work and live for some time.
</p>
<p>
So why wasn't I thrilled with the job?  I didn't know, and I still don't, quite.  A lot of other things were going on in my life then, but nothing that would make me shrug off my career.  Still, I said fuck it, and went back to <a href="http://stjohnscollege.edu/" title="stjohnscollege.edu">college</a stjohnscollege.edu>.  Liberal arts.  Philosophy, literature, mathematics, history of science, and music.  Fuck yeah.  These days I'm fairly sure I don't want to re-enter the software industry.  I think that I will keep programming, but this time for something like, visualizing all the kickass epicycles, equants, and general circles galore of Ptolemaic geometry, perhaps in <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/user/classics/cpas.html" title="pitt.edu">graduate school</a pitt.edu>.

Lately I've been having such crises more and more regularly. Partially that's because I was in boring jobs with incompetent management, partially because I've been programming too long and realized that there's more to life than sitting in front of a computer. The current job is good, and bearable at 30 hours a week. Still, if and when I leave this job, I'd like to do something different than programming. Trouble is, I'm quite good at it, and it pays relatively well (compared to other jobs, it does).<br> <br>A lot of people I've spoken to and who also had a crisis like this said they'd like to do something where they exercise their hands, not their heads - like gardening. Or maybe some social job. Of course you need knowledge for that as well. It'd also be nice to do something that doesn't involve month-long projects and endless meetings. That's one reason I took up playing Go. Completing a game takes minutes to hours, success is objectively measurable, it's fun and challenging, and it's still a complex system that's worthy of detailed study.
