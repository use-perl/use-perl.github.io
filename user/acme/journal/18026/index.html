<p>So everyone has been <a href="http://ometer.com/desktop-language.html">worrying</a> about high level languages on the desktop.
<p>
Well I decided to have a play with the <a href="http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net/">Gtk2 Perl</a> bindings last week or so. It took me a while to get the hang of how things went on, but overall I really like how easy it is to put things together.
<p>
I decided to write a sample app using GLADE. I created a window, added a text field, a button, and a list view, and saved it as <a href="http://unixbeard.net/acme-svn/Parse-CPAN-Authors/examples/authors.glade">XML</a>. Then I wrote a program which uses Parse::CPAN::Authors, reads in the GLADE file using Gtk2::GladeXML, and puts in the right hooks. See the <a href="http://unixbeard.net/acme-svn/Parse-CPAN-Authors/examples/authors.pl">source</a>. See a <a href="http://astray.com/tmp/authors.png">screenshot</a>. Hey presto, a small GUI interface to search the CPAN author list. I really liked how easy it was to put together. GUI in Perl isn't dead. <i>Maybe its time has come...</i></p>

<h2>gtk and perl is quite nice</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2004-03-24T09:24:11</h3>
I did some GTK programming by hand in both C and Perl a year or two ago and I found it very productive.
<p>
I might try GTK2 again, the only concern I have with perl/gtk is the long list of dependancies involved - if I could build an easy to deploy bundle using GTK2 and Perl I would choose that over QT/C++ which I am currently looking at for writing GUI applications.
</p><p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>..of course I will probably try and do both as I want to learn C++ properly (i.e. write real code to do real jobs, its the only way to learn) and perl is so rapid it is ideal for prototyping a desktop or GUI application (yes, it is also fast enough to be the real thing too)</p>



<h2>How about Wx?</h2>

<p>Very nice. Why didn't you use Gtk::SimpleList? I'm not familiar with Gtk but the interface looks simpler</p><p><blockquote><div> <i>acme said...</i> <br>I really liked how easy it was to put together. GUI in Perl isn't dead. <i>Maybe its time has come...</i> </div></blockquote>

<p>It's very much alive with <a href="http://wxperl.sf.net/" title="sf.net">Wx</a sf.net>. I've knocked up a quick port of your app to wxPerl. Screenshots on <a href="http://www.simonflack.com/_linked_/authors_wx_msw.png" title="simonflack.com">Windows</a simonflack.com> and <a href="http://www.simonflack.com/_linked_/authors_wx_gtk.png" title="simonflack.com">Linux</a simonflack.com> are available as well as the <a href="http://www.simonflack.com/_linked_/authors.pl" title="simonflack.com">source</a simonflack.com> </p>

That looks pretty good. I'd given up on Wx as I've found it hard to install and there wasn't Glade for it. Looks like wxGlade helps a lot in this respect<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
