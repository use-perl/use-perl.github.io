Here follows quick writeups of the talks I attended.
</p><p>
Jose Castro gave a "less than 10 minutes" Perl Foundation talk.
</p><p>
Larry Wall "Standards are meant to be broken" - A typical Larry talk,
this covered many things including names, names dispatch at compile time,
short names and long names. Not about the language, but more about the parser.
Perl6 grammar is flexible and Perl has no core, no operators, no language,
"I've been working on a "longest token matcher" for the last year",
JIT lexer per language. "Perl 6 is designed to extensible, so please 
embrace it and extend it".
</p><p>
Kang-min Liu "Continuous testing". Eclipse plugin for java that runs 
JUnit led Test::Continuous, which checks the files you have modified and
runs the appropriate tests. CPANFTW: File::Modified,
Module::ExtractUse,
App::Prove,
Log::Dispatch.
</p><p>
Jose Castro "Perl Black Magic - Obfuscation, Golfing and Secret Operators
in Perl" is still a very amusing talk on how to scare people.
</p><p>
Lunch! Sandwiches were provided, but I escaped for katsu-don nearby. Tasty!
</p><p>
Ingy dot Net "JavaScript Love for Perl Hackers" covered many topics:
vroom - vim love for perl hackers.
pQuery - jQuery in Perl (has one thing that jQuery will never have - Perl!).
something to learn Taiwanese.
JS.pm - storing JavaScript in CPAN.
</p><p>
Leon Brocard "Working in the cloud". Hey, that's my talk, and I managed to
pull it off with only one line of Perl code in the whole slide deck. <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/acme/living-in-the-cloud/">See the slides</a>.
</p><p>
Jesse Vincent "Step 3: Prophet - A peer to peer replicated property
database" was a very interesting talk and a little bit of a reply to mine.
Prophet is the cool part, and as an example application there is a p2p
bug tracker called sd. The hard part is self-healing conflict resolution.
"svk for bigtracking". "private social networking".
"Jifty, Catalyst, Rails models in future".
</p><p>
Chia-liang Kao "Running Perlish Small Business with Perl" was great.
He made individualised buttons for OSDC.tw in Cairo. "Mass customisation".
Perl hacking to make businesses run.
</p><p>
Makoto Kuwata "The Fastest Template Engine in the Perl World". Tenjin.
Compiles to Perl templates because the templates are Perl.
</p><p>
Lightning talks were very amusing (and harder to write up).
</p><p>
Jonathan Rockway "String::TT". String overloading. Excellent.
</p><p>
"i love money!" yapc asia finances
finances over time, -2 million yen before yapc::asia last year.
2008: positive all the time, up to 2 million yen before conference
</p><p>
Daisuke Murase "Open Fastladder with Plagger" - 
popular web-based rss reader on your computer
</p><p>

version.
</p><p>

</p><p>
yusukebe "WebService::Simple" - to return cute photos of cats
</p><p>
ingy: vroom -vroom Vroom::Vroom / zhong shell
</p><p>
clkao "Prototype::Signatures" - how hard could it be?
