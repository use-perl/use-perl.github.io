<p>The first day of the conference has passed and it all went well. I didn't go to many tutorials, but instead hung around and met up with everyone. It was great to see people again, and it's always good to meet new people.
<p>
A journalist for the Oregonian interviewed me and asked me why I came to these conferences. The real reason is to meet people and come back with lots of wonderful ideas of things to hack on in the future. We're constantly changing all our work code whenever we get new ideas or hear about new, better modules. The best thing is the energy I have coming back from conferences.
<p>
Anyway, I spent most of the day with Tom playing <a href="http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Kory/Games/Zendo/">Zendo</a>, a wonderful little logic games with pretty coloured pyramids. It's kind of like Mastermind but backwards, or like a scientist trying to figure out the laws of physics. It's pretty fast-paced and even complete newbies like myself and get up to speed pretty quickly.
<p>
Looks like James & I got my <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2003/07/07/photos1.html?page=7">photo</a> on the O'Reilly website.
<p>
After a quick sushi dinner with a loooong table of Perl geeks, Arthur, James and I went out to drink the town dry. Hic. I don't think we succeeded.
<p>
I'm actually writing this on Day 2, and it's going to be a hectic day. <i>You'll find out why soon...</i></p>
