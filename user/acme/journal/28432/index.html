<p>I'm much more productive when I hack while listening to <a href="http://www.somafm.com/">Groove Salad</a>. I find it relaxes me a little and I can concentrate on getting things done. What do you listen to while hacking?</p>

Glenn Gould playing Bach at the moment; more frequently electronic/dance like Juno Reactor, Dieselboy, and Amon Tobin, or "angry" music like System of a Down or Godsmack.

Glenn Gould playing Bach is my standard coding music.  In particular, the Well-Tempered Klavier, book two.  It's rock and roll!

Good choice.  I've been rocking out to the (older) Goldberg Variations and the Art of Fugue recently myself.  For WTK 2, I actually prefer a recording by Angela Hewitt, but that could just be because I heard it first.

The older ones?  I like the 1981 ones *way* better.<br><br>I haven't heard either the Art of Fugue or the Angela Hewitt recording that you refer to.  Perhaps I will be able to track them down.<br><br>One of my long-term ambitions is to be able to play the whole WTK well.  As I don't have access to a piano at the moment, that's going to have to wait for a long while.

Which recording did you hear first?  I think the 1956 vs. 1981 preference is just a combination of primacy and familiarity.  I only recently got the 1981, so perhaps I will prefer it once I've had a chance to listen more.

<p>As for other recordings: If you're in the Bay Area I think the Berkeley public library (still) has the Hewitt.  AoF is sort of strange, with about half played on an organ, so it's an acquired taste.

</p><p>Having learned some Bach on the guitar at one point, I can't imagine being able to develop and maintain over 4 hours' worth, but that is definitely a worthy goal, one that I wish more people shared.</p>

<p>Moby &#8212; First cool hive</p>

<p>Anything ambient/chillout, really. (See <a href="http://del.icio.us/ap/netradio" title="del.icio.us">http://del.icio.us/ap/netradio</a del.icio.us>)</p>

<p>Also, just about anything Oliver Lieb has produced.</p>

I like ambient while coding too, although I also tend toward electronica as well. Music with words is too distracting, unless I've heard it a million times before.

Interesting stuff from various people I know:<ul><li>vogelscheiss.com for classically-influenced stuff<br></li><li>stevecastellano.com for fun technoish electronica (I particularly like "Increased in Strength" - vocal samples are taken from a promo movie for stereo recordings; the repeating mantra of "innovation<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... invention<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... innovation<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... invention<nobr> <wbr></nobr>..." at 144 BPM gets my creative juices really flowing)<br></li><li>doubtfulpalace.com (Shalamaneser, Mercaptan, Phosphene Grid, Slaw)<br></li><li>U2, Sting, Pat Metheny, Lyle Mays, Laurie Anderson...<br></li></ul><br>More that that, but that's basically what's on iTunes at work.
