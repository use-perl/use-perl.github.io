<p>Well, I successfully completed my quest to be the first person up for the whole of YAPC, and I've made peace with the squirrels on the way down here from the dorms. I always time long trips so that just when I get used to the jetlag, I head back home again.
<p>
Day 2 of YAPC was hectic and cool as I predicted. I started off by attending "Perl on .NET and .NET on Perl", and there are lots of exciting new ideas there. Whether it'll take off or not is, errr, guesswork at the moment, but it's interesting how Perl's dynamic typing fits into .NET's strict typing environment. Something to watch in future.
<p>
I then continued on the Brian Ingerson Inline Track (tm) with "Polluting Perl with C, Java and other rubbish". Rubbish and cute at the same time. I'm sure there are now lots of new Inline converts here...
<p>
A short break for lunch downtown amongst the beautiful students (so who wants to get Inline::Java running with Java beans then?), and then I stood in for "Orchard: A simple alternative to XS", which I would love to have seen. Ken didn't turn up, so I did an improptu "What I did with Inline yesterday" talk on Tie::GHash. See the previous journal entry (hey, I've already got my first patch for it from Ken Simpson!). 
<p>

Brian then introduced us to Data::Denter and his new, errr, not a markup language, YAML, which promises to be small, readable, and handy. I'm not quite convinced yet...
<p>

I rushed off to a talk by the NuSphere guys about their commercial Apache / MySQL / mod_perl bundle wotsit (I think the Apache Toolbox is a good solution for that too), and gave my "Perl Monger World Map" talk, which involved pretty pictures (as all my talks do), XML (to please Michel Rodriguez), and Inline (to please Brian). A pretty quiet talk.
<p>

Damian gave his "Life, The Universe, and Everything" talk.
Amazing. Astounding. Astonishing. etc. etc.
<p>
An organised dinner took place (ObGeek: we set up a wireless network with an IRC server so that people on our table could talk) and then I remember walking to a pub, playing snooker and then pool, eating garlic bread, walking back home up the hill, Far Side cartoons and then sleeeeeeeep.
<p>
Day 3 promises to be very hot with some great talks. On with the show!
