<p>Yesterday kicked off with Daniel Karrenberg explaining the beginnings of RIPE, leading on to a great talk by sky of POE (no, I'm still not sure I understand it) and an overview of Apache 2 and mod_perl 2 (which'll never come out, right? ;-)
<p>
The highlights of the afternoon were the lightning talks, a series of quick talks from a wide range of people. Some were technical. Some were fun. Some were unprepared. I <i>did</i> warn everyone that slides were probably overkill, and there were a few technical problems. However, most were excellent, especially Nicholas Clark's presentation of floating point/integer conversion using large props. And davorg's of course.
<p>
My journals are getting shorter and shorter. Apologies, all these conferences are tiring me out. Luckily I have a couple of days in Amsterdam to relax. It's all wonderful! Another successful Perl conference!
