NAME
    WWW::Gazetteer - Find location of world towns and cities

SYNOPSYS
      use WWW::Gazetteer;
      my $g = WWW::Gazetteer->new();
      my $london = $g->fetch("London", "United Kingdom");
      print $london->{longitude}, ", ", $london->{latitude}, "\n";
      my $nice = $g->fetch("Nice", "France");
      my @bactons = $g->fetch("Bacton", "United Kingdom");
      # note: more than one Bacton in the UK!

DESCRIPTION
    A gazetteer is a geographical dictionary (as at the back of an atlas).
    The `WWW::Gazetteer' module uses the information at
    http://www.calle.com/world/ to return geographical location (longitude,
    latitude) for towns and cities in countries in the world.

    Once you have imported the module and created a gazetteer object,
    calling fetch($town, $country) will return a list of hashrefs with
    longitude and latitude information.

      my $london = $g->fetch("London", "United Kingdom");
      print $london->{longitude}, ", ", $london->{latitude}, "\n";
      # prints -0.1167, 51.5000

    Note that there may be more than one town or city with that name in the
    country. In that case, you will get a list of hashrefs for each
    town/city.

    The following countries are valid: ...

<h2>and US cities?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/kellan/">kellan</a> on 2002-10-02T21:00:36</h3>
I noticed a distinct lack of the US among the available cities list. (presumably because the nima.mil isn't supplying the info?)  Do you have a hybrid solution for also getting lat/longs for US cities?<br> <br>thanks<br>kellan

<h2>Re:and US cities?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/acme/">acme</a> on 2002-10-03T06:43:58</h3>
Yes, I noticed that too. I put it down to the US not being very important... Oh, okay then: patches welcome<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)



<h2>Re:and US cities?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jhi/">jhi</a> on 2002-10-03T17:24:13</h3>
<p>The US info is available from the US Census  Bureau website either as a <a href="http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/places2k.html" title="census.gov">database</a census.gov> or a <a href="http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/gazetteer" title="census.gov">query form</a census.gov>.</p>

<h2>Another database of geographical data</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/BooK/">BooK</a> on 2002-10-08T08:00:57</h3>
<p>Here's another database, that has lots of cities and aliases, with longitude, latitude and <i>elevation</i>: <a href="http://www.heavens-above.com/countries.asp" title="heavens-above.com">http://www.heavens-above.com/countries.asp</a heavens-above.com>.</p>
<p>I've built a script that sucks the whole
database (it was the subject of one of my
lightning talks in Munich), but maybe it could
be turned into a module, too. Is there room
for this in the WWW::Gazetteer namespace?</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Another database of geographical data</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/acme/">acme</a> on 2002-10-08T08:36:06</h3>
Ah cool, I knew there was something like that. The Calle database also has elevation, it's just that I didn't find it useful<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-) Well, maybe we need a WWW::Gazetteer::Calle and a WWW::Gazetteer::HeavensAbove. What do you think?



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Another database of geographical data</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/BooK/">BooK</a> on 2002-10-08T09:54:30</h3>
<p>Well, my script still needs to implement the
optimisations I talked about in Munich...
But if you provide a generic WWW::Gazetteer
API, I can make WWW::Gazetteer::HeavensAbove
follow it.</p>
<p>If the module doesn't have to fetch
the results of a request like "a*", and
work around the 200+ answers limitation,
that should be quick and easy (provided
I find enough spare time to do it,
obviously).</p>

<p>Elevation <i>is</i> useful, if you want to produce a proper <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/user/esr/jargon/html/entry/ICBM-address.html" title="tuxedo.org">ICBM block</a tuxedo.org> for each perl monger group.</p>

<p>I'm not sure who this would be useful for - it seems that we know Saddam Hussein's favourite brand of chocolate (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2186151.stm" title="bbc.co.uk">Quality  Street</a bbc.co.uk>) and computer manufacture (<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/8/16864.html" title="theregister.co.uk">Sun</a theregister.co.uk>) - but do we have any idea what his favourite programming language is, and hence if we should be afraid?</p>
