<p>I think I did too much Perl in my hectic four weeks of conferences. I had to crash out a bit, not do too much Perl, play GT3 a lot and drink a bit less. I think I've just about recovered - I partied last weekend, going to a free open-air Paul Oakenfold party, and dancing in the rain to the sound of soca and steel bands at the Notting Hill Carnival. It was fun.
<p>
 I visited my favourite restaurant (St. John) last night, which has helped too. They serve real food there, such things as bone marrow, ox tongue, and grouse. They always have a token vegetarian dish, but I tend not to bring vegetarians... Last night I had almost the best prawns I've ever eaten, a slice of middlewhite (a rare breed of pig) with some lovely carrots and some bread icecream. It was lovely.
<p>
Now for Perl stuff. I've released minor updates to most of my modules and the new <tt>Data::Page</tt>. Today I took up dumrats' coding challenge and coded a
SOAP interface to dipsy, the #london.pm infobot using
the wonderful <tt>SOAP::Lite</tt> and <tt>POE::Component::IRC</tt> modules. Enough people asked my how I achieved this that I wrote up a short
<a href="http://www.astray.com/services/">article</a> on the subject. Enjoy.

<p>
unimatrix is in town! I fear the fact that we have wireless access in the pub we're meeting up in... What crazy Perl stuff will result in this? (Seeing that ingy wrote <tt>Acme-YBFOD</tt> there a couple of weeks ago...)</p>
