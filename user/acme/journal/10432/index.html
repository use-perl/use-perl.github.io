<p>I've always wondered what modules people have installed from CPAN, but
CPAN has too many mirrors. Versions are interesting too. So I got bored last night and played around with LWP, DBD::SQLite and Sort::Versions. Here is a
beta version of <a href="http://www.astray.com/cpanstats/">CPANSTATS</a>.
<p>
It's not official in any way, and like all stats be careful interpreting them. No, it's not perfect, but I decided to get it done instead. Patches to make the client more portable welcome.</p>

This is a very cool idea, I'm running it from cron now. I've never really understood why CPAN didn't collect these sort of statistics. I particularly liked how you saved the UID in the source code<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>Ultra Cool</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/malte/">malte</a> on 2003-02-06T12:42:05</h3>
This is ultra cool. Been waiting for this a very long time.

<p>I know it won't happen but couldn't we display the information inside search.cpan.org?</p>



<h2>Very interesting data</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mir/">mir</a> on 2003-02-06T13:52:37</h3>
<p>A few comments:</p>
<ul> <li>iIt is really interesting to see the version of each module that users have installed (man, XML::Parser 2.20! That's OLD!), </li>
<li>it looks like versions are not sorted quite properly though, if I judge by the data on CGI.pm,</li>
<li> It is also quite surprising that only 40 out of 43 users have CGI.pm installed... I thought it was part of the core</li>
<li>There sure are a lot of modules in the Canon:: name space<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;--)</li>
<li>who is running 5.007003?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;--)</li>
</ul>

I'm using Sort::Versions and it looks like it sometimes go wrong. And now thanks to Mark Fowler, the client now has an --ignore flag, so local modules such as Canon:: don't necessarily get into the stats<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
<p>
Interesting reading though.</p>

<p>It generated a lot of warnings and a few failed regression tests while I installed the modules needed to run L&eacute;on's script. I see I'm not the only person with a 5.005_03 now, but I'm still the only 5.9.0. (Which is actually what I'm using day to day for development tasks. I don't have anything in production yet, but I suspect I'll use 5.8.0 (or 5.8.1 once it's done) for that)</p>

<h2>Report</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/belg4mit/">belg4mit</a> on 2003-02-06T17:40:27</h3>
If you're going to timestamp the report it would be nice to include the time zone. Also, stating somewhere on the site how often the reports are<br>generated would be good. Finally, how are there<br>58 users on the current report when I just signed up and have a UID less than 58?

A timezone would be useful but I'm not too worried about it being up to a 24 hours off, to be honest. The report is generated every 10 minutes, I've added a note about that. Oh, and you noticed a bug about the number of users. I used a COUNT where I meant a DISTINCT, oops<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
<p>
I think this is a sign that I should stop coding and instead head off to the London.pm social meeting...</p>
