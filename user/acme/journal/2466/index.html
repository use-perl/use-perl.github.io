<p>It has come to my attention that every single woman I know is an angel. Or a fairy. Or both.
<p>
I finally realised this at a birthday party this weekend, where the unwritten theme was "fairies". All the beautiful women had fairy wings on. Nobody had the same wings. Some had feathers. Some shimmered. Some were small. Some were large. And their owners had not bought them for the occassion: it's just something they had lying around. I don't have any fairy wings. Do you?
<p>
At the Japanese cookery course on Sat we made some cooked watercress with ground sesame seeds and a sort of teriyaki chicken with a lovely mirin, sake and soy sauce. It was tasty.
<p>
This weekend I have mostly been carrying heavy objects for my sister, who's moved into a new flat. It constantly suprises me how much stuff you actually have. It's all over now, but that 90-kilo fish statue was a killer.
<p>
I presented a test run of my <a href="http://astray.com/parrot/">Inside Parrot</a> talk at the London.pm tech meet last week, which went fairly well.
 The plan for the talk was to give people a good grasp of Parrot assembler, but it turns out that people are more interested in the reasons behind Parrot. I think I've convinced a couple of people to hack on Parrot, so that's good at least.
<p>
<i>Hmmm, I should probably remember to actually have lunch at lunchtime...</i></p>

<p> but...I digress. Catholic girls get wings at an early age for the Christmas pagent [ seriously ] and Victoria's Secret has made wings fashionable again. It's also an easy costume for any occasion since having a demon sidekick is purely optional and it's generally thought to be a reasonably fetching look without being outrageous.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>The one thing I won't miss about being at college is moving all my life from home I to home II six times a year.  Given that I also went to a boarding school for 7 years before having 4 years in University halls, I might well be the best packer this side of an A-level statistics paper[0].</p>
