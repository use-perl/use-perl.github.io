<p>Why do people seem so obsessed with slides? I've seen a great many lightning talks and they almost all had slides. Lightning talks are only 5 minutes. Generally people spend a minute or two setting the projector up. You have five minutes to get your point across and the way to do that is to talk to your audience, not read bullet points off a Powerpoint presentation. I shall boo at people with slides at the London.pm Lightning Tech Meet tomorrow ;-)</p>

We don't really need slides for most lightning talks;  As the article I wrote for Perl.com will go to show (bug me when you get back to the office and I'll show you a preview)
<p>
Of course I <em>am</em> overly concerned with slides...because I'm organising everyone else and if they <em>are</em> going to use slides then I want them NOW so I don't have 14 nutters running around on the day each trying to get their laptop plugged in.
</p><p>
Oh, and I'll be using slides.  But mainly because I can't describe &#8220;m&#248;&#248;se&#8230;&#8221; in words.  Pesky unicode.</p>

What the fuck is a m&#246;&#246;se?

I posted this to the YAPC::NA <a href="http://yapc.kwiki.org/index.cgi?SuggestionsBox" title="kwiki.org">suggestion box</a kwiki.org> after the conference:
</p>

<blockquote><div>
Minimize the setup time for individual Lightning Talks, as originally mandated by MJD. Specifically, have presenters either use transparencies, or have all presentations on a single machine that stays connected the entire time, or something. The delays between each talk kill the momentum.
</div></blockquote>

<p>
Perhaps enforcing the "your presentation starts the moment that the previous presentation ends" rule would encourage people to be a little less slide-obsessed?

If they insist on using slides, and they're not uploaded in advance, they'd better be on a USB keyring jumpdrive!

<h2>why slides? nobody knows.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pne/">pne</a> on 2004-07-22T12:28:46</h3>
It is indeed a mystery, and I've wondered the same in the past.



<h2>Why?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2004-07-22T14:55:33</h3>
Because who wants to look at the nervous geek when you can look at pretty pictures of babies or read text? Maybe if you had a proxy like Colin Firth or Hugh Grant talk for you<nobr> <wbr></nobr>....or, well, some chick with big boobs or something...:)
