<p>Yesterday evening I rushed off after a quick beer to my P5EE BOF, which I was worried about. <a href="http://p5ee.perl.org">P5EE</a> is an attempt to code enterprise Perl, or get Perl ready for the enterprise. What we decided this meant was that we would like Perl to be used in more places so we could get jobs easier ;-) I'm only half kidding. A lot of good points were made. P5EE grew out of the mod_perl list and there were a great number of high-caliber mod_perl people there. I'm not going to try and summarise it all, but maybe what we need is to bless modules like "DBI" and "Cache::Cache" and embrace all other modules. Either that or get a huge marketing budget...
<p>
Talking of budgets, I then took part in <a href="http://www.perl-foundation.org">The Perl Foundation</a> BOF. For such a young company, TPF has done well, but it's obvious it needs to do better. It's going to explain what it's doing and be more open. More on this soon.
<p>
A quick <a href="http://www.tt2.org/">Template Toolkit</a> BOF later where I think Andy understood what Larry has been going on about. TT is going to be more open. It'll take a while, but wait til you see what we're planning.
<p>
I then spent my time between gnat's party and Casey's Quake LAN party, which was fantastic. Free beer, twenty computers and the ability to be fragged by your open source friends. Rael and Pierre kicked my ass, but it was fun. I headed home to get some sleep before my Parrot talk today... </p>
