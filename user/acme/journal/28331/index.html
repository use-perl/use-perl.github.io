It's not just webby stuff, you know. This week I've been mostly been writing PDF using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PDF-API2/">PDF::API2</a>.
The docs are complete, but there's a <a href="http://www.printaform.com.au/clients/pdfapi2/">walkthrough</a> which is very helpful. Of course, I had to go slightly overboard and read the <a href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/pdf/index_reference.html">PDF Reference</a>. PDF::API2 is pretty good, you can copy pages from other PDFs, insert images and use TTF fonts. Actually doing the design is a bit tedious (this box here, this text here in this colour) but not too hard. I really liked working on this project as I'm generating a very colourful, well-designed double-sided A3 sheet with minimal amounts of coding. I'd recommend it whenever you have to generate and print very specific designs. I quite like PDF, and I wonder why it's not more popular. Well, apart from (0, 0) being bottom-left...

In cooking news, I made <a href="http://www.astray.com/recipes/?show=Roasted%20curried%20sweet%20potatoes">roasted curried sweet potatoes</a> yesterday, mmm...

<h2>Bottom Left?  Ohhhh</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/GAVollink/">GAVollink</a> on 2006-01-12T20:46:32</h3>
That explains why I've seen so many things output "upside-down" in PDF applications!



<h2>PDF::API2++</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ChrisDolan/">ChrisDolan</a> on 2006-01-12T22:36:39</h3>
I like PDF::API2 too.  The author is very responsive on the pdf-api2 mail list.  The difficult font support is very well done, in particular.  And I'm the author of a "competitor" module, CAM::PDF.  Well, not really competition -- PDF::API2 is optimized for creating PDFs while CAM::PDF is optimized for editing PDFs.  We've taken ideas from each other's code and we've both taken ideas from the earlier Text::PDF.<br><br>My biggest complaint is that PDF::API2 lacks regression tests.<br>

Oh another point I forgot to make: why it's not more popular.  I think the main reason is that it's an end format rather than an intermediate format.  That is, PDF can be very hard to edit.  Editing PDF can be like composing a letter in Illustrator.  There are just better optimized tools for that.<br><br>And that said, it's a hugely popular format.  There simply is no competitor today for cross-platform, pixel-perfect, efficient delivery of static media.  Someday, SVG may compete but not yet.  Some people treat MS Word like a cross-platform vehicle for documents, but it's far from cross-platform, or even cross-version!<br>

<h2>Yam Fries</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/markjugg/">markjugg</a> on 2006-01-13T16:37:36</h3>
I'm fond of a similar recipe: <a href="http://www.theppk.com/recipes/dbrecipes/index.php?RecipeID=57" title="theppk.com">Yam Fries</a theppk.com>.



<h2>Sweet Potatoes...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2006-01-13T21:15:33</h3>
Interesting - I made Roasted Curried Sweet Potatoe Soup for Christmas Eve (and we just finished off the left over soup that went in the freezer this week). It was yummy.<br><br>Basically take your recipe there, mash them up, add butter, coconut milk, some herbs and spices, blend, sieve, and serve with some corriander.
