<h1>Which logging module?</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p> <div>One of Perl&#39;s mottos is &quot;there is more than one way to do it&quot;. This is of course a great thing, except when there are two ways to do it and I can&#39;t decide which is the better one or the most popular one. Such is it with logging modules - there are two stong candidates: <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Log-Dispatch/">Log::Dispatch</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Log-Log4perl/">Log::Log4perl</a>. Both do about the same thing, which makes it annoying to decide between the two. Which one do you use? Which one should become the best practice CPAN module for logging?<br /></div></p>

<h2>Naming</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Smylers/">Smylers</a> on 2008-08-28T11:34:34</h3>
<p>I'd pick <code>Log::Dispatch</code>, to avoid promoting <code>Log::Log4perl</code> as being a good name for a Cpan module: repeating the top-level namespace obviously doesn't help with knowing what the module does ("When you said 'Log' the first time I wasn't sure whether this really is a logging module, but now you've said 'Log::Log' I can see that you mean it"?); and putting "4perl" at the end, that's to distinguish it from all those Cpan modules which aren't for use with Perl is it?</p><p>(Yes, I know <em>why</em> <code>Log::Log4perl</code> is called what it is; that still doesn't mean it should be encouraged.)</p>

<p>It should have been called simply <code>Log4perl</code>.</p>

<h2>How can we support both?</h2>

<p>I've been thinking a lot about the same thing, and I'd really like to see something like an agnostic logging interface where users could use either as they liked, just as DBI does for databases.</p><p>I'd like to put in logging calls into my modules, but without a dependency on any logging module. If an application uses Log::Dispatch, my module level calls get converted into Log::Dispatch things. If they use Log4perl, then my module does the right thing for that. If they don't use either, there is a default  null class sorta thing that handles the calls.</p><p>I have a private application which does this about half way. The application basically uses the same interface (trace, debug, warn, etc) methods, but it autoconfigures at the beginning. It's a big pile of crap because it's half done and my first idea on how to do it, but someone probably has a good idea.</p><p>However it works out, I think both packages are nice and I don't want to make other people choose. I like Log4perl, but that's just because it does what I want and I don't need to do any more.</p>

<h2>I use Log::Dispatch</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ron Savage/">Ron Savage</a> on 2008-08-29T00:36:11</h3>
<p>It's well-designed, and works perfectly.</p><p>Log::Log4Perl looks big, complex, although it may load components intelligently, and hence, dare I say it, has all the hall-marks of the disaster known as Cobol-for-Dummies, previously known as Java.</p>



<h2>unix vs win32 logging</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ddick/">ddick</a> on 2008-08-29T03:45:04</h3>
I take it that we're talking about best practice for unix style logging modules?



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:unix vs win32 logging</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/acme/">acme</a> on 2008-08-29T06:43:29</h3>
Perl runs fine on win32. When running an application, you want all the the logs in one place. Using one of these modules it should be possible for all the applications in your module to log in a consistent place (even if they are written by other people), be that a file, syslog, or whatever.

<h2>both</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pfig/">pfig</a> on 2008-08-29T09:36:07</h3>
<p>log::log4perl to set up the infrastructure and different log::dispatch loggers attached to the different logging classes and/or levels.</p>
