Computers are getting faster, that's for sure. However, they are also getting more cores: new laptops thesedays are dual-core and servers are four-or-more-core. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicore">Cores</a> are a fancy word for something a bit like another processor. I happen to have lots of things I want to process independently, but if I only use a single process I'll only use one core, a quarter of those available on my server. That's wasting CPU power. The solution is to do more than one thing at a time and common solutions for this are threading and forking. I've found a particularly neat solution which is a very nice idiom too: parallel foreach with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Proc-ParallelLoop/">Proc::ParallelLoop</a>  Something along the lines of the following, 
which will parallelise the loop by forking 4 workers at a time:
</p>
<pre>
pareach \@todo, \&generate, { Max_Workers => 4 };
</pre>
<p>
The nice thing is that Linux balances each long-lived process on a core, and suddenly my program runs about four time faster! 
(Okay, so cores aren't complete CPUs - they tend to have dismal floating point performance - but all I am doing are integer calculations so it is mostly the same in my case).
</p>
<p>
There are many modules on the CPAN which do something similar, but I particularly like the fact that this is a cute idiom: exactly like a foreach, but slightly parallelised. Neat!
</p>

See you at the <a href="http://xrl.us/social">London.pm social meeting</a> tonight!

<h2>Multiple Cores and Floating Point Parallel-Each</h2>

<i>so cores aren't complete CPUs - they tend to have dismal floating point performance </i>

<p>That may depend upon brand and architecture. But really, Parallel-Each dispatch of floating point operations would be the wrong way, multi-core or single-core SMP.

<p>The issue with Turion64 and Intel Duo-Core / Xeon is largely because they're based on the lower-power Mobile versions of the core. This apparently is because power-and-heat is the limiting design factor today. Heat/Power and cores sharing the FSB are why the clock speeds aren't as fast as the prior server single-core too.

</p><p> <b>But</b> more to the point, if you have <b>floating-point arrays</b> to <code>parallel-each</code> over, you want to do it in native arrays and hardware dispatch, not Perl list structure and a perl-core XS module loop. This applies on any serious Fortran engine's FPU Vector mode as well as IA32 MMX SIMD. <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=PDL" title="cpan.org">PDL</a cpan.org> already has native representation and parallel SMT threaded multiple dispatch, and has a TODO to use the native FP vectors. Even so, it should keep the FP pipeline much more active than a Perl-list-based parallel-each, plus it's CPAN packages interface to scientific libraries that can use vector-mode FP if acquired/built that way (e.g., pick a BLAS lib for Gnu Sci Lib).</p>



<h2>Do Perl 6 Junctions do this anyway?</h2>

Isn't there a Perl 6 way to do this?
