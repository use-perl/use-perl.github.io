<p>It's very important when naming things to remember that "new" is time-relative. There's a bridge in Paris called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pont_Neuf">Pont Neuf</a>. That means "New Bridge". Of course, in the 17th century it was new. However, now it's the oldest bridge in Paris. At various work places I have seen machines named "newdb", "newdev", etc. Of course, they are no longer new. Put a little bit more thought into it and pick sensible names, please!</p>

<h2>Windows NT</h2>

"NT" == "New Technology". It's about the oldest incarnation of Windows still in use.

<p>
We also have in the north-east quadrant of the <b>Terra Nova</b>, from north to south: <b>Nova Scotia</b> (New Scotland), <b>New Brunswick</b> (province), <b>New England</b>, which latter includes <b>New Hampshire</b>, <b>New Jersey</b>, including another <b>New Brunswick</b> (city).

</p><p>In the Other New World, they have a <b>New South Wales</b>. All we're lacking is a New Guernsey and a New Cornwall ?  Wait, there were two New Cornwall's<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... in N.S. and N.Y., of course. (And much of New England was once <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornwall_County%2C_New_York" title="wikipedia.org">Cornwall County, Province of New York</a wikipedia.org>.)

</p><p> <b>Boston MA</b> was named for Boston UK (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston%2C_Lincolnshire" title="wikipedia.org">St.Botolph's Town</a wikipedia.org>, only 85 years older than Boston MA!) and spawned New Boston among several others latter-day nameakes. Most of the old towns and counties around Boston MA are named for old towns and counties of Olde England<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but lacking any deference to the original context.  E.g., Suffolk County is north of Norfolk county, and don't even ask about Northboro, Westboro and Southboro. Falmouth, Yarmouth and Plymouth are at least sea ports, but the biggest creek with their mouth in town wasn't named Fal, Yar or Ply, alas. None of the bridges in Cambridge bridge a river Cam, but rather the R.Charles, named for Charles R., regnant at the founding. The city of Cambridge MA was originally called New Towne to distignuish it from Boston and Charlestown, and was later subdivided into Cambridge, Watertown, and Newton. At least Cambridge is known for it's bridges, but the Harvard Bridge goes from Boston to MIT. (It's so named because MIT wasn't there yet when built, but it's apparently NOT on the site of a college-operated Toll ferry and later bridge of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_River_Bridge_v._Warren_Bridge" title="wikipedia.org">some fame in legal circles</a wikipedia.org>.)

</p><p>In <b>Boston Proper</b> -- Since the colonial governor's offices built in 1713 and still standing at the Boston Massacre Site on State Street in Boston and both a tourist attraction and a subway (tube, metro) station is uniformly called the <b>Old State House</b> <a href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/freedomtrail/oldstate.asp" title="cityofboston.gov">OSH</a cityofboston.gov>, the 1798 building on Beacon Hill is often still called the <b>New State House</b> <a href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/freedomtrail/massachusettshouse.asp" title="cityofboston.gov">NSH</a cityofboston.gov>, irrespective of how many times it's been updated/expanded/regilded.  By contrast, <b>Old City Hall</b> <a href="http://www.oldcityhall.com/history.htm" title="oldcityhall.com">OCH</a oldcityhall.com> is rather more recent (1865) -- and one of it's other predecessor(s), <b>Faneuil Hall</b> (1742), home of many a revolutionary debate, is also still standing <a href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/freedomtrail/faneuilhall.asp" title="cityofboston.gov">FH</a cityofboston.gov> and newer than the Old State House too.  <b>Old City Hall</b> is roughly contemporary with <b>New Old South Church</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_South_Church,_Boston,_Massachusetts" title="wikipedia.org">NOSC</a wikipedia.org>, which is the home of the relocated congregation from <b>Old Old South Church</b>, which was of course originally known simply as <b>Old South</b> before they relocated to the reclaimed land of Back Bay after the great fire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_South_Meeting_House" title="wikipedia.org">OOSC</a wikipedia.org>. (It was <b>Old North</b>'s steeple that Revere's lanterns were hung in, but Old South is where the Tea Party and such like rebellous meetings convened that weren't allowed in Faneuil's or Town Hall.)  (In comparison, the "Boston Public Libary New Building" name was taken on by the "Johnson" building from the "McKim" building in only 75 years; but they're adjacent &amp; connected.)

</p><p>The classic "it's still new after all these years" has to be <b>New College, Oxford</b>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_College,_Oxford" title="wikipedia.org">NCO</a wikipedia.org>, 1379 -- it's the original quad college, shockingly new in the day.    However, <a href="http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/C/CA/CARCASSONNE.htm" title="1911encyclopedia.org">Carcassonne New Town</a 1911encyclopedia.org> in Languedoc FR is older (1262; fortified 1347), which is older than the New Town's founded by England in Aquitaine during the 100 Year's War.</p>

<h2>Constructors?</h2>

So, instead of $pkg-&gt;new(), perhaps I should write $pkg-&gt;might_be_new_but_maybe_its_kind_of_old()

<h2>naming is a difficult art</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jhi/">jhi</a> on 2006-03-02T05:52:57</h3>
The same applies for other attributes than age: what once felt like a great idea to name your module as Foo::Simple or Foo::Small or Foo::Easy or Foo::Smart or Foo::Fast (or Foo::Fast<b>er!</b>)or or Foo::Cool or Foo::Elite or Foo::Bombastic or Foo::Orgastic, will feel (or look) really stupid in a few years, or sooner.



<h2>historical naming considered harmful</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/n1vux/">n1vux</a> on 2006-03-02T18:56:42</h3>
Indeed. It's not just "new" that's a problem. Naming a system (hardware or software) for the vendor or counterparty or 3rd party software package or the latest department renaming is doomed to create a historical curiosity. Vendors and correspondants get renamed in mergers&amp;acquisitions. (The Big 8 accounting firms aren't even 6 anymore?) Software packages get re-branded. And departments get renamed with the political wind. Name a system for what it does, not who it talks to.
