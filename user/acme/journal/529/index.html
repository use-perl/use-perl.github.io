<p>Friday was the last day of the O'Reilly Open Source Convention, and a
very long day it was too. I simplified my choice of sessions by
following the Damian Conway track - starting off with "The Damian
Conway Channel". Damian explained a number of modules that he's
developed in the past year. Some (say the attribute modules or
Filter::Simple) were obviously more useful than others (say
Acme::Bleach).

<p>

Quite a few people have asked me recently about the silly modules on
the CPAN, such as my <tt>Acme::Buffy</tt>. Yes, the module is silly
and nobody should really use it in production code, but I'm of the
opinion that it shows that the community is mature enough to make fun
of itself, I've recently read Linus Torvalds' "Just for Fun" which
contains the meaning of life (or at least Linus' one). He says that
most things are developed in three stages and that we are always
striving to reach the third stage. He explains how things like sex,
fire, and Linux have progressed through the stages.

<p>

The three stages are survival, community, and entertainment. How does
Perl fit these stages? Well, initially we were using Perl to rapidly
develop applications in order to get the job done quickly and keep our
boss happy. We've then progressed to the community stage, where we
release modules to the CPAN, meet up in Perl Monger groups, and have
Perl conferences in order to improve our standing and gain the
admiration of our peers. I believe we're reaching the entertainment
part, where we realise that Perl <em>is</em> the game. I expect
many exciting new Perl developments in the near future now we've
reached this stage. The <tt>Acme::</tt> modules are only part of
it. Wait and see.

<p>

In the afternoon the wonderful lightning talks (a series of rapid,
five-minute talks) took place. These were all excellent, the
highlights being Damian, ingy, and davorg. Is there anything Damian
<i>can't</i> do? 

<p>

And with that, TPC5 ended. It was long, it was tiring, but it was
excellent. The scheduling was great. The BBQ-flavoured worms were
great. It seemed that everyone had speaker badges. I learnt a great
deal. The parties were great. I got some great new tshirts (thanks
<tt>brian</tt>, ingy). I met lots of great people and had some
wonderful conversations. 

<p>

Later on, we headed down to the beach and grabbed some local food and
partied.  I'm typing this on the flight back. Ingy is staying with me
for a couple of days in London and then off to Amsterdam for
yapc::Europe!. If only I can recover in time...

<p>
