<p>Yesterday was the second day of the real conference and was terribly hectic,
jumping from talk to talk trying to assimilate as much information as possible.
<p>
The keynotes today were by
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_craig.jpg">Craig Mundie</a>
from Microsoft and
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_michael.jpg">Michael Tiemann</a> from RedHat.
Craig was obviously not prepared for a big room full of geeks, while
Michael went for the easy points he knew we'd all agree with. There was
a roundtable discussion with Tim asking the best questions. Interesting, but
nothing we haven't seen before.
<p>
I went to
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_speech.jpg">lenzo's</a>
"Perl and Speech" talk - which was about using Festival and Sphinx to do
cool stuff with Perl. I'm definitely going to play with this some more...
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_ziggy.jpg">Ziggy's</a>
"Extensible POD" was next, where he walked a fine line between keeping it
simple and having decent structure.
<p>
"Use Python" by
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_python.jpg">lathos</a>
was next, where he described the scary things he's been doing with
B::Generate. Very cool. We just need some more spare time for finish
the Python/Ruby/Java/C#/C to Perl compilers...

I then sat in
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_xmlrpc.jpg">Randy's</a>
"XML-RPC with Perl and Apache" talk, but didn't learn a great deal.
I think web services are cool, but how come there aren't any?

<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_geekcode.jpg">Michel</a>
presented his
<a href="http://193.251.86.24/pgc/">Perl Geek Code</a>, which was very cool.
And I don't only mean that for <tt>CO++++</tt> ;-)

<p>

The afternoon had a "what's happing in Perl" theme, with
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_perl6.jpg">Dan</a>
presenting all his cool new ideas for the Perl6 internals and
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_perl58.jpg">Jarkko</a>
showing us all the cool new stuff in Perl 5.8.



  <p>
 A quick stop for some cool
<a href="http://infotrope.net/album/poundperl/">#perl photos</a> and
then to the bar for a
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_tt3.jpg">Template Toolkit 3</a> BOF and off to the ActiveState
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_activestate.jpg">party</a> with
more Danger Mouse and Monty Python.
