<p><p>Sun may bill itself as the network is the computer company, but its <a href="http://www.network.com/">Sun Grid Compute Utility</a> still isn't live. Amazon really does understand this however and they've just released the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=201590011">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a>. It's a compute grid based on Xen. They provide some ready-made system images or you can build your own. The virtual machines you run have "provides the equivalent of a system with a 1.7Ghz Xeon CPU, 1.75GB of RAM, 160GB of local disk, and 250Mb/s of network bandwidth". The costs are entirely reasonable: only $0.10 per instance-hour consumed + network and storage via S3.
</p>
<p>
They provide command-line tools and a good walkthough. The nice thing about virtual machines is that they look like real machines:

That's just one VM, but you can have many in your compute cloud (only up to 20 in beta). It's true what programmers say: any problem can be solved by adding a virtualised layer. Bring on the virtual machine revolution!

Had I stayed up another hour, I'd have been in on the beta.

I gotta say I'm practically drooling over this.<br><br>If I can just work out a way to write a PITA guest driver for this sucker, we could really have something special.<br><br>My concern is that it's going to be quite tricky to do though, I guess I'll need to find some time and read through the documentation and see how it handles misbehaving virts.<br><br>

This was the first thing (and first person) I thought of when I saw the news. You should write to Amazon; with their committment to Perl, they probably be quite interested in PITA, and possibly getting you in on the beta.
