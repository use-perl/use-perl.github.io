<h2>Backstage</h2>

I would be very interested in hearing a little about  the project. "Backstage at Backstage" or something<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>How you handled the project management, brainstorming ideas, and of course the technology, stuff like that.

Leon is my bitch and he does what I say...
<p>
Ok - it was more of:
</p><p>
Our approach was get something working, then add important stuff and when bored add funky stuff (like the Ajax bits).
</p><p>
We did the basics..
</p><p>
Leon did the Parser: TV::Anytime, I wrote the import scripts (sucker that I am) and then the basic search.
</p><p>
Then started adding more stuff, Leon did a member ship systm with ratings and then the sechedule and recommend stuff, we just focued on what we were interested in and talked a lot on IM.
</p><p>
Then I fixed a load of issues with the import - then fixed some more - and have just fixed more (minor things like the data feeds saying programs were finishing before they started!)
</p><p>
We went through several refactoring sessions and it all just came together, we started assing RSS and because we were using Catalyst they were available for all pages (with a little tweeking).
</p><p>
We might do a talk on it at some point.</p>
