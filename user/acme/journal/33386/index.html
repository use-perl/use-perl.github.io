<p><p>Today I'm at the <a href="http://code.google.com/events/developerday/uk-home.html">Google Developer Day</a> in London. There are many people here and it's at a lovely venue with huge projectors and lots of blue LEDs. It feels a little like the first few OSCONs were like, lots of friendly geeks and hackers, including people I haven't seen in a while. Chris Dibona started off the keynote with a good message on how what's good for the web is good for Google (and highlighted <a href="http://gears.google.com/">Google Gears</a>) and then Ed Parsons tried to convice us that all our data is really geodata.
</p>
<p>
In a separate session Chris went over Open Source at Google. Unfortunately he spends his time worrying about licenses ;-) He went over all the projects and how they decide what to opensource and what projects they use internally. He's a great speaker.
</p>
<p>
I'm sitting in "Google Earth and the GeoWeb" which is an introduction to KML. First he shows us something in Google Earth, then he shows us how it is done. I've used KML in the past and it really needs better examples like the ones here.
</p>
<p>
After this there's the API workshop, where I get to play with APIs and then we'll be watching the Mountain View keynote. There may be drinks afterwards. It's a fun conference which shows off all the different things that Google provides for developers. Now time to hack with Gears...

<h2>Microsoft Developer Days...</h2>

Is it any different? Sounds like google trying to get people to use the their tools. Much like the old Microsoft Developer Days.<br><br>Perhaps I'm just too cynical<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
