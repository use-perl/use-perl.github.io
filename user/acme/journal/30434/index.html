<p>I've been hearing a lot of talk recently about how people are looking forward to doing something for $random_technology_which_isn't_finished yet, but they'll hold off until it is finished. Here's a tip: you can do it now, and without that technology. Don't wait for new technology. Don't wait for new software. Real something is always worth more than potential something. Please do it now instead!</p>

<h2>It comes from experience and lack of time</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2006-07-26T17:20:56</h3>
It comes from trying programs from some svn repository that will be "going to CPAN real soon now" and being swamped in bugs, and not being able to add a dependency because it doesn't exist on CPAN.<br><br>It comes from code that sorta works, that is going to never get beyond sorta works.<br><br>It comes from knowing in advance you are going to have to submit 20 or 30 bug reports just to get the thing somewhat usable, and not having the time to invest in it right now, because you are writing 20 or 30 bugs for some other thing far more worth the time.<br><br>It comes from people's inherent lazyness, and their inherent suspicion of people that don't deliver.<br><br>And it comes from people's waiting for the author to say "OK, it's done. Go play"<br><br>It comes from all these things, and I'm sure more, in various doses.<br><br>I for one only have a limited time budget for things that aren't finished yet, because they demand time from you, whereas I have a much better time budget for things that are finished, because they ask for little time from you, and don't hang around pestering.<br><br>I'm sure many others are the same.
