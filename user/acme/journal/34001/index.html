Every time I buy new servers, I'm shocked as to how fast they are. At work we've just specced out a few 2x quad core Xeon servers. That's 8 cores per server all clocked at the same speed as the last set of dual-core servers - it is insane. I know that as a computer scientist I should be fully aware of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore's law</a> - as Wikipedia puts it:
</p>
<blockquote>Expressed on a shorter timescale, however, Moore's Law equates to an average performance improvement in the industry as a whole of close to 1% per week.
</blockquote>
<p>
I urge you all to upgrade your hardware, you'll be impressed as to how fast it'll be. To be honest, we really need some sort of subscription service for servers: "I'll buy X times the same fixed price server every six months".

<h2>My old servers are still good enough</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grinder/">grinder</a> on 2007-08-07T07:12:36</h3>
<p>The flip-side of this observation is that we bought our largest slab of servers at $work in 2003. Intel Xeons running at over 2GHz, 2-4 Gb of RAM, fast SCSI disks... and they are still "fast enough".</p>

<p>The idea of upgrading them is nowhere on the radar yet. Moore's law has sort of become irrelevant.</p>

<p>Although my own PC could be upgraded and I wouldn't mind. 1.3GHz <b>is</b> slow.</p>
