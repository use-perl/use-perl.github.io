<p>It has just struck me that the following line of a Template Toolkit template has six different delimiter styles: &lt;, ", [%, (, ', and {:
<pre>
<a href="[% uri_for('add_size', {product_id => product.id}) %]">Add new size</a>

Is this too many or just right?</p>

<p>Funny you say that, &#8216;cause I was just thinking the same about sigils today. Yeah sure, they&#8217;re noisy and can gunk up the code &#8211; also, they&#8217;re extra red tape that needs to be typed over and over. But they make it so much easier to scan the code! Consider something like this:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>10 * $bar * log( $foo + 2 + cos( $baz ) )</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>You can immediately tell apart the &#8220;slots&#8221; where variable values go, the static pieces, and the function calls, even if without consciously reading the code. Sure, it&#8217;s uglier than this:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>10 * bar * log( foo + 2 + cos( baz ) )</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>But the sigil-laden version is definitely easier to scan. In fact, now that I&#8217;m laying them out side by side like this, the difference is striking.</p>

<p>I <em>like</em> sigils. Not pretty. But convenient.</p>

I had that side-by-side experience when changing the javascript on <a href="http://speedtest.aoeu.nl/" title="speedtest.aoeu.nl">http://speedtest.aoeu.nl/</a speedtest.aoeu.nl> to a more perl-like style. Another huge advantage of sigils is that you can use variable interpolation - that's the rare occasion where sigils are prettier than the alternative, lots of concatenated string literals.

<h2>Maybe just right with a possible tweak</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ferreira/">ferreira</a> on 2008-04-07T12:48:48</h3>
<p>
It may be just right. Mainly because not having so many delimiters could be worse: requiring the need for hard-to-read escaping.
</p>

<p>
On another note, maybe one of the delimiters of the mentioned template piece could disappear, by writing something like:
</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>a href=[% uri_for('add_size', {product_id =&gt; product.id}) | qq %]&gt;Add new size&lt;/a&gt;</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>
where the <code>qq</code> filter would add the leading and trailing quotes and would take care of any necessary entity-escaping. It hardly contributes to the original intent of your note, but it improves on the correctness of producing HTML attribute values. (The assumption "this never has characters that need escaping" is an invitation for future pain.)

<h2>More ways to do it</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Phred/">Phred</a> on 2008-04-07T18:26:28</h3>
<p>There's more than five ways to do it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>



<h2>As an aside</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grink/">grink</a> on 2008-04-08T18:57:05</h3>
I like to use a helper function href() , which is a wrapper to c.uri_for, to generate that sort of thing (since it's so common)<br><br>&lt;a [% href(...) %]&gt;Lorem ipsum&lt;/a&gt;



<h2>when I look at the stack...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grendelan/">grendelan</a> on 2008-04-09T00:49:47</h3>
when I look at the J2EE stack, or the LAMP stack, or any of the other "web based" shite, I long for the elegance of native GUIs..... NeXTStep in particular.   I wonder if us engineers will ever be able to steal things back from the marketing droids.



<h2>Quoting specifically, not just delimiting</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Crag/">Crag</a> on 2008-04-09T20:45:26</h3>
Those are all quoting characters.  Additional delimiters in that string are whitespace, comma, equals sign, =&gt; and a period for a total of eleven delimiters.
<p>
But quoting in particular is more interesting than delimiting in general.  Hofstadter wrote a great book about it.  Maybe you've heard of it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p>
Using different quoting syntax for different contexts makes perfect sense to me.  Here's what your example would have looked like in a fake-lisp syntax I'm making up right now:
</p><p><p><blockquote> <div><tt>(a (href (uri_for "add_size" (product_id (product id)))) "Add new size")</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>
I tried indenting but it didn't help:
</p><p><p><blockquote> <div><tt>(a<br>&nbsp; (href<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (uri_for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"add_size"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(product_id (product id))<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; ))<br>&nbsp; "Add new size")</tt></div> </blockquote>
