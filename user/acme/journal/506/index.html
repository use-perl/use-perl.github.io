<p>Yesterday was the first day of the real conference, with the first
keynotes by
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_cisco.jpg">Cisco</a>
and
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_ms.jpg">Morgan Stanley</a>.
The latter was by far the most fun, as he was clearly someone who had hacked
open source code and knew the problems with deploying 




open source across
large, widely distributed locations. His point was that he could adapt
open source products much more quickly that non-OS ones, and that
the support was better. He was preaching to the converted of course, but
he was cool.
<p>
The talks started for proper today, and I sat in upon DJ and Piers'
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_jabber.jpg">Transfusing Message Plasma into Business with Perl and Other Magic</a>
talk, which was really about Jabber and SAP. The talk was very interesting
and the live demonstration only more so. I'm not quite sure what Jabber
really is (once it's moved on from instant messaging) or that we need
XML routers which aren't completely P2P, but it's terribly exciting anyway.
<p>
I headed down to the
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_exhibitors.jpg">exhibition hall</a>
to check out who was there. The highlight was clearly the pingpong-playing robot, although the Cooltown pens were very pretty too ;-)
<p>
I then popped into davorg's
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_increasing.jpg">Increasing Perl Use</a>
talk, which I'd seen before (and where he attempts to make all
computer languages other than Perl illegal). I wonder at what point
everyone realised it was a joke...
<p>
A quick lunch later, and I presented my
<a href="http://www.astray.com/instant_compilers/">Instant Compilers</a>
talk with Damian, which was fun, although we ran out of time towards the
end. I sang a lexing song. People joined in. I don't think I'll quit my day job.
<p>
Muttley's "Flash in the Pan" talk was next, and was cool as always, and
then I presented (for the last time!) my
<a href="http://www.astray.com/graphing_perl/">Graphing Perl</a>
talk. It was the last talk of the day. People relaxed and looked at my
pretty pictures.
<p>
The evening started with a
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_fiesta.jpg">Fajita
Fiesta</a>.
The food was cool and the band rocked. The band also rocked at the
Stonehenge party, and it was great when esr starting
<a href="http://www.astray.com/photos/graphics/tpc5_esr.jpg">jamming with the band</a>.
<p>
The evening continued with much more partying and
<a href="http://www.dangermouse.org/">Danger Mouse</a>


     (He's The Best.
He's The Greatest.
He's The Greatest Secret Agent In The World!)...
