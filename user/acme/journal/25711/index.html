<p>The Perl Foundation took part in Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/summer
ofcode.html">Summer of Code</a> program and managed to get <a href="http://www.p
erlfoundation.org/news/2005/googlesoc2.html">8 projects funded</a>. This is the 
sixth in a series of informal interviews finding out more information about these projects. Up now is Josh McAdams with "BitTorrent Peer Library For Perl".
<p>
<b>Hi there! Tell us a bit about yourself, including age, where you
are a student and what you are studying</b><br/>
My name is Josh McAdams.  I'm 25 years old and am working on a Master's of Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.ualr.edu">University of Arkansas at Little Rock</a>... hopefully I'll be done by the end of the year and can breath again.
<p>
<b>You've had a Google Summer of Code project funded. What will you be
doing? How will you be doing this? What's the final product?</b><br/>
My SoC project is to create a BitTorrent peer using Perl.  Uri Guttman has volunteered to be my mentor, so we are going to use his <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/stem/">Stem</a> system to create a BitTorrent peer implementation.  In the end, I hope to have something that I can upload to CPAN so that others can easily include BitTorrent downloads in their Perl programs.
<p>
<b>How did you get interested in this topic?</b><br/>
I started listening to podcasts a few months ago and decided to brew my own podcatcher using Perl.  However, some of the podcasts that I liked used BitTorrent for their file distribution method.  I went searching for a set of modules that I could use in my scripts and came up empty handed.
<p>
<b>Where do you see your project going after this summer?</b><br/>
Hopefully it will be a success and will continue to be maintained and live on CPAN.
<p>
<b>Is there any way to track your progress over the next few months?
Got a blog?</b><br/>
I haven't posted much about it yet, but I'll try to drop some entries in <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jmcada/journal/">my journal</a>.
<p>
<b>Did you expect to get funded?</b><br/>
Not really.  And of course, Google didn't help my confidence any by waiting until the day after their deadline to announce accepted projects.
<p>
<b>Got a silly fact about yourself or the project?
</b><br/>
I was going to to do the project anyway as part of my Master's thesis :)  At least now I'll have some guidance and can make it good.</p>
