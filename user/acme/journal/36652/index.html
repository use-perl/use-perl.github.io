<p>Very often use.perl.org is slow or down for me. It's also 1990s technology. My next few blog posts will be on <a href="http://acme.vox.com/">my other blog</a>. Let's see how it goes.</p>

I agree, yet I'm not one of the masses of people using a feed reader... I use use.perl as Perl aggregator, and when good bloggers drop of it, I have tended not to follow them elsewhere.<br><br>At the same time I'm frustrated that use.perl hasn't evolved as blogging platform and continues to suffer from things like poor titles and poor SEO.<br><br>Perhaps a "Planet" - style aggregator for Perl blogs would be a reasonable alternative. People could use the blogging platform of their choice, and one site would aggregate the blogs.<br><br>I'm not volunteering, just wishing.

You mean like <a href="http://planet.perl.org/" title="perl.org">http://planet.perl.org/</a perl.org> ? (Where this entry is currently top<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) )

In addition, maybe TPF could allocate some money to a web designer. Compare Planet Perl to, say <a href="http://planet.gnome.org/" title="gnome.org">Planet Gnome</a gnome.org>....

Ah yes... just like that. I'll have to see about getting included there... and start checking it regularly.

I must say that the temptation to run a blog locally has been stronger since I've discovered Planet Perl.  However, I've yet to discover who to contact/bribe to have a blog thrown in the gravitational well, or if it's a honor reserved to the Perl High Priests. Do anyone knows?

Scroll way down to the bottom of the bar at the right and it says it's <a href="http://noc.perl.org/" title="perl.org">Robert and Ask</a perl.org>.

True.  And following the trail seems to lead to <i>webmaster at perl.org</i>.  Hmmm... I have a contact, I finally managed to get Angerwhale to run yesterday.  It also seems like all the stars are aligning for something to happen.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Just to share the information: I've contacted the webmasters, and they don't take self-nominations for the Planet (darn).  They instead periodically go through suggestions they received and, if a blog meet their criteria, add it to the heap.

You may then be interested in <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/hex/journal/36686" title="perl.org">Perlsphere</a perl.org>.

I dunno if I count as a high priest, but I'm not on there either.

<p>Well, for starters I don't see a single gradient or shiny/reflective icon.  Plus, it is built on Perl which is so totally 1990.</p><p>Get back to me when you've rewritten use.perl in Ruby on Rails.</p>
