<div class="span8">
<p>Here is a list of amusing comments or bits of code I have found in the Perl debugger. They make me laugh, they make me cry:
<pre>
# Before venturing further into these twisty passages, it is
# wise to read the perldebguts man page or risk the ire of dragons.<br/><br/># This would probably be better done with "use vars", but that wasn't around
# when this code was originally written. (Neither was "use strict".) And on
# the principle of not fiddling with something that was working, this was
# left alone.<br/><br/># This was an attempt to clear out the previous values of various
# trapped errors. Apparently it didn't help. XXX More info needed!<br/><br/>@RememberOnROptions = qw(DollarCaretP OnlyAssertions);<br/><br/># Just exactly what part of the word "CORE::" don't you understand?<br/><br/># Here begin the unreadable code.  It needs fixing.<br/><br/># XXX This looks like a bug to me.
# Why copy to @ARGS and then futz with @args?<br/><br/># No signal is active.
$signal = 0;<br/><br/># Hey, show's over. The debugged program finished
# executing already.<br/><br/># local *dbline = *dbline; # XXX Would this work?!<br/><br/># If the pattern isn't null ...
if ( $inpat ne "" ) {<br/><br/># Can't run shell commands with Unicode in the debugger, hmm.
$cmd =~ /^$sh$sh\s*([\x00-\xff]*)/ && do {<br/><br/># The following code may be executed now:
# BEGIN {warn 4}<br/><br/># Expand @stack.
$#stack = $stack_depth;
# Save current single-step setting.
$stack[-1] = $single;<br/><br/># Swing and a miss. Bad syntax.<br/><br/># Nuke whatever's there.<br/><br/># De-Perl4-ify the name - ' separators to ::.
$subname =~ s/\'/::/g;<br/><br/># Line didn't make sense.<br/><br/># Clever test. If you're a mathematician, it's obvious why this
# test works. If not:<br/><br/># XXX Okay, what do $frame and $doret do, again?<br/><br/># XXX It behooves an OS/2 expert to write the necessary documentation for this!<br/><br/># is it really less, pretending to be more?<br/><br/># Drop dead.<br/><br/># I just *know* there are men without -M<br/><br/># XXX This may be an extraneous variable.<br/><br/># I may not be able to resurrect you, but here goes ...<br/><br/># XXX I have no idea what this is doing. Yet.<br/><br/># Did we find something that makes sense?<br/><br/># Do not trace this 1; below!
</pre>
<i>Funny, eh?</i>

<h2>Debugger humor</h2>

Sometimes you get a little loopy after staring at the debugger for a long time (2+ years to write most of that documentation).<br> <br>I can't claim credit for the "unreadable code" one though. That was an original, dating back to very close to the debugger's inception.<br> <br>I'm glad you noticed. I was wondering if anyone would ever actually look at all that work...



<h2>MJD?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/yDNA Barak/">yDNA Barak</a> on 2005-03-29T17:00:35</h3>
Isn't MJD taking a whack at a rewrite of the debugger?

As far as I know, yes. Don't know how far he's gotten. I think Higher-Order Perl (and being a dad) may have taken up most of his cycles up till now.<br> <br>For entertainment, look at DB.pm in any recent Perl distribution. Interesting, innit? Sarathy actually put that together a long time ago, and wrote a proof-of-concept debugger called SWAT that used it. If you're interested, I can track down the SWAT source for you.<br>

Somehow obra convinced me to have a go at a new debugger. <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-ebug/" title="cpan.org">Devel::ebug</a cpan.org> is the result so far. "Devel::ebug is a work in progress."

Nothing wrong with that. Clearly we're in the basement (or the dungeon), where level numbers increase with depth.
