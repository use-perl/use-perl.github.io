<p>This weekend I was at EuroFoo in Enschede, NL. This was a small invite-only opensource-type workshop organised by O'Reilly folks. It was a great deal of fun. There were quite a few Perl people, but the most important thing is that most people weren't Perl people.
Don't get this wrong, I do like Perl people, but I always see them at conferences, so it's nice to see different people doing different things with different ideas ;-) And boy were there lots of ideas. The fun thing about EuroFoo was that there was no schedule. We made up the <a href="http://wiki.oreillynet.com/eurofoo/wikis.conf?SaturdaySchedule">schedule</a> on the first night.
<p>
So first off, we'll have some shiny lights. A couple of Fotango employes had thrown together 
<a href="http://www.pipetree.com/gallery/EuroFoo2004/LeonAndTerabyteStorage">a terabyte of storage</a>. So that's five <a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/Products.asp?DriveID=49">250G drives</a> RAID5-ed over FireWire. The glowing lights were just a bonus. We had it slurping/serving HTTP / iChat / DPAP. Oh, and we gave a little storage talk early on. Fotango needs lots of storage, and wants to do it with commodity components. The discussion turned more towards syncing later on.
<p>
Some of the interesting talks were discussions about a European OSCON (London too expensive, maybe Amsterdam or other, Europe already has lots of big cheap tech conferences though), 
<a href="http://www.blinkenlights.de/">Blinkenlights</a>,  the BBC creative archive (no DRM, by the end of the year, and I hate licensing), opening up BBC programme info (although we really want the content), and <a href="http://www.mobilewhack.com/programming/perl/perl_on_nokia_at_foo.html">Perl on your mobile</a>.
<p>
But more importantly we had lots and lots of discussions outside the sessions, or the beer track as I like to call it. Lots of crazy ideas. The great thing is that everyone there was a "thinker" <i>and</i> a "do-er". Practical open source hacking.
<p>
It was a great experience. Many thanks to everyone there. However now I must colllllaaappppsssseeeee....
