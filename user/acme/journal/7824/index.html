<p>If the offchance that you haven't seen the movie, this is what happened. Due to a little mixup with timezones I got the the conference a little late, and met up with everyone. As is normal for conferences, once we'd registered (and got our YAPC beer stein!) everyone sat around with laptops huddled around power outlets and trying to get wireless working.
<p>
There are three main rooms here, sponsored by Fotango, nanoware.org and Mobile.de (going from huge to titchy). All the logos this year are orange. Hmmm. And the tshirts too. Hmmm. Nothing to do with me! It just happened! I deny everything!
<p>
I sat in various tutorials in the morning (I'd seen all of them already) and headed off to the university canteen for lunch, which was quite nice, but prison-like. In the afternoon I went to Schwern's "Advanced Testing" tutorial, which was a little hectic, not very advanced, and had various people giving mini testing talks to pad it out. It's a little bit of a shame as I'd have liked to do more advanced things. Schwern rocks, though.
<p>
In the evening I somehow got dragged off to the speakers' dinner, talked about everything, ate great food, drank more beer, and somehow made it back to the hotel in time for a couple of schnapps.
<p>
The next day of the conference (errr, today, but I'm writing this after it happened, duh) is full of lots of little talks and will prove to be very interesting I'm sure.
This conference is great. Well organised, good speakers. What more can you want?
<p>
By the way, I'm trying to put all the YAPC::Europe 2002 movies and photos in one place, so please take some and then tell me where they are.</p>
