<p>I am frustrated with gnotime, the only time management tool I can seem to find that semi suits my needs.  It's still too, for a lack of a better word, "<i>BETA</i>" for me. I don't want to write my own custom templates for even the simplest of things, and I certainly need a way to manage journal entries for each projects work in the day better than gnotime.<br><br>Has anyone had experience with a better and more reliable time management system?  I have looked at a few like phprojekt but I don't need something where there is an ability for multiple users to collaborate... I need something very personal and I need it now.. so frustrating.
<br><br>
CSS has me in awe. Decided to use that for the res t of the sites I develop, starting with my own. I'm going to attempt only CSS, so long spacer.gif and your evil twin "</table> tag missing, does not validate.".  I'm thinking that with the speed of not having to download bulky and complex table code paired with mod_perl at the Apache::Registry level, my site, and all of my projects that are soon to follow will be blazing fast.</p>

You sound like me... picky.<br> <br>And, rightly so IMHO. Something like this needs to fit pretty well.<br> <br>This probably won't, then again... it might. I haven't upgraded to the new version, but the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.8 series, while limited in features... has been incredibly stable.<br> <br>And... all the data sits in a MySQL database, which was one of the big plusses for me. I really just wanted a quick front end to get my data in... I generate custom queries for anything the program itself won't do.<br> <br> <a href="http://www.achievo.org/" title="achievo.org">http://www.achievo.org/</a achievo.org>

I will check it out. I appreciate the link. I guess I am a bit picky, but who isn't.

Upon further inspection and installation, these seems overly complicated for my needs, but I like this much better than phprojekt. I will keep it in the back of my mind.
