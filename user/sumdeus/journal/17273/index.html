<p>Ooops. Neglected to read the comments from my last two posts. Good, good comments too;well the ones I understood. If you posted something and I didn't respond, my apologies, I've been terribly busy.  But thanks!

I've been reading over the lazyweb stuff, it seems like an interesting idea, although a little scattered in terms of material if you ask me.

I've been working on designing my company website in my _spare_ time. I think I've made it to the logo and header and designed all the other pages.  Now all I need to do is use my baby Template Toolkit and a little perl magic and I'm all set. I plan on "whipping" up a couple of nice mod_perl applications for demo's and then I will begin to target some telecommuting perl work.  A good plan, I hope.
<BR><BR>
In the meantime, I have been spending large amounts of time working with PHP!  Gasp, I know, I have no choice. So far I've written a PDFRenderer for an xml description file, a FlashRenderer for that same xml description file, a couple of xml schema's to describe the xml description files, a myriad of xml parsing helper classes, and xml classes that allow dom tree manipulation.  Everything has gone rather smoothly and it's finally up and running beautifully. In fact, it's running so well, I'd like the make some changes to the xml schema and rewrite both renderers in Perl so they are much more effecient and easy to maintain. That would be quite the project, but when complete would allow xml descriptions of any type of document (like a business card or Sell sheet). More to come on this later.</p>
