<p>I've been messing around with mod_perl and template toolkit for the last few days. I've been reading through a lot of information on the both. Before I started this, I knew how they both worked, but had never actually created a mod_perl installation from scratch.  Now I have my own!<br><br>
So I'm really only trying to do something simple with them both to begin, I want the following:
<ul><li>Requests to /foo.htm, which is actually a template, is taken care of by mod_perl</li>
</ul>
Seems simple enough? Here's the setup I have right now... all requests to /foo.html are converted using mod_rewrite to /mod-perl/handler.pl?file=foo.html. So I have Apache::Registry as the real "handler".  <br><br>
What I'd really like, is to have my own handler, which I "attempted" without success. You will want to ask, "what was the problem"? Of course, I'd answer, with a smart ass smile, "it didn't work!".  No,no, the problem was that it didn't seem like it made sense in this case... perhaps overkill?<br/><br/>I just don't know the most appropriate way to map a request for an html file through a custom mod_perl handler to template toolkit. Is there some 'industry' standard? I can't find any useful examples, all I find are the generic "do-this" tutorials... even in the safari/oreilly books.  Maybe I'm browsing the wrong one!<br><br>Any hints ,URLS's, or book names would be greatly appreciated for this mod_perl administrating neophyte.</p>

<h2>Apache::Template</h2>

See Apache::Template - like Apache::Registry, but for templates instead of CGI.pm scripts.

Thanks Randal. Now all I have to do is figure out how in the hell to get it installed without gcc on the machine.

What's your OS ? and how did you install mod_perl without gcc<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) ?

Dare I say it's a hosting company... where they/I have about 200 perl modules installed, but for some reason this isn't one of them.  They don't have gnu tools for security reasons, of course for another 15 bucks a month I can get them.  I'm stuck with them for another 1/2 a year, so I have to make due. Unfortunately I need gcc for the xs stuff.

<h2>mapping URLs to template files</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/perrin/">perrin</a> on 2004-02-26T17:03:35</h3>
First off, I am not a fan of Apache::Template, or of mapping your URLs directly to the name of a template file.  I think the URL and the name of the file you're going to run should have only a loose mapping, therefore I usually just map my URL to a handler, and then let the handler decide which template to run based on what it's doing.  For example, requesting<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/login/ might result in running login_form.html, or maybe login_error.html, etc.<p>
However, if I were trying to do what you are doing (map<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/foo.html to a handler that will run a template called foo.html), the easiest approach is the Files directive:</p><p><blockquote><div> <tt>&nbsp; &lt;Files *.html&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; SetHandler&nbsp; perl-script<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; PerlHandler My::TT::Handler<br>&nbsp; &lt;/Files&gt;</tt> </div></blockquote>Then in My::TT::Handler you just look at the URI (see the documentation for the $r request object on the mod_perl site) and decide which file to run through TT based on that.<p>
This being apache, there are 1000 other ways to do it.  Some are in the new TT book, one of them in on-line <a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/docs/plain/Tutorial/Web.html" title="template-toolkit.org">here</a template-toolkit.org>, and all of the ways people do it with other systems like HTML::Template apply to TT as well.</p>

Very helpful, and nice since I don't need to install any additional modules. I will goof around with the handler... I was using Location directive instead of the Files so things were a little goofy.<br> <br>Appreciate the comment.
