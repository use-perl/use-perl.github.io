<p>Monday I will filing a certificate of DBA here in Schenectady. I have the domain name all picked out and ready to roll, along with a VDS hosting company which has mod_perl. I'm excited just to have mod_perl on a server that I don't have to have racked anywhere near me, yet have almost complete control over it. Very good news. I will have more information on the specs of the company after monday, for now though it's just me.<br><br>
Other good news, the company that I currently do telecommuting work for is very interested in having me as a consultant from now, well into the future. This is very good news since they are right now my only source of income! Cheers guys for sticking with me.<br><br>Thanks to the first post here, Randal Schwartz emails me out of the blue and says he will be in Albany tonight. That could be interesting and did I mention very interesting?<br><br><br/><br/>I came across a nice script to help when you are trying to determine a list of all installed modules on your system. I know there are other ways than this, but this script gives you quite a load of information and is certainly worth mentioning <A HREF="http://sniptools.com/perldigger">http://sniptools.com/perldigger</A>.<br><br>
Finally, it's never too early to start planning for the 2004 YAPC conference. This year is BUFFALO, NY -- my old residence. Site is: <A HREF="http://buffalo.pm.org/yapc/">http://buffalo.pm.org/yapc/</A>

<h2>along the lines of perl modules...</h2>

<p>I have a script, <a href="http://www.webdragon.net/mr/" title="webdragon.net">modulereport</a webdragon.net> that does things along the lines of the CPAN 'r' switch, but also reports additional info (such as when your installed module is newer than what CPAN thinks exists, which has helped me diagnose a number of bugs in the CPAN itself. With Andreas' help I've been able to nail quite a few of them, though some still continue to linger. (MailTools, IO::*, XML::SAX::Base) )</p>

<p>You might find it useful. I usually run it via crontab every day so it e-mails me the results around 11:30 am, giving authors some time in the morning to get their uploads in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
