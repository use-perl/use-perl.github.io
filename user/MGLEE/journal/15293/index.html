<p><p>Sunday night I come back from a weekend away to find the front door swinging in the wind, and cabling strewn across the living room floor. We'd been burgled.</p>
<p>You can tell a criminal mastermind by the value of the goods they take. I was most disappointed that my stereo system and extensive CD collection went completely untouched. The TV/video connection was dismantled and then abandoned, presumably there isnt much of a market in 10yr old 14" PAL/SECAM TV's. That surprises me, they're pretty rare. </p>
<p>The video collection was obviously rifled through, apparently 'Toy Story 2' and a dodgy copy of 'Peter Pan' (dubbed in French) cant be exchanged against a heroin dose. But much to my relief my dungeon full of computers went unnoticed.</p>
<p>So what did they take ? Ummm well ... my slightly mouldy and distinctively odourous gym bag. They did tip out the trainers and deodorant first, even so I dont think this will put off any tracker dogs. A cheap watch, and my wife's camera, which was actually quite valuable, and no doubt will be soon on sale at a local neighbourhood car boot sale.</P>
<p>Perhaps its time I wrote all my software projects to CD, you never know when it might be needed.</p></p>

<h2>Criminal Mastermind</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2003-10-21T11:18:00</h3>
<p>In my experience most criminals are stupid. Like you say, they steel worthless things, usually causing more damage and emotional distress than what they take. Even when they do steel something valuable, they can only get a fraction of it's real value them selves, and if it's been marked (UV postcode marking is supposed to be quite effective), there is a reasonable chance that it will get returned to you - though it may take quite a while....</p>

<p>The real criminal masterminds are the white collar thieves who steel millions or even billions from investors, how many petty break ins add up to the Enron or WorldCom scandals? Better still, if a CEO get's caught, he gets a few stern words, and either nothing or a suspended sentence.</p>

<p>I ask you, if you were to become a criminal what would you do, break into people's houses, or steal millions via the stock market?</p>

<p>At least burglars don't have to wear ties.</p>
