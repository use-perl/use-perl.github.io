<div class="span8">
<p><p>An indian friend of mine as a small Hindu shrine in her home. One of the pictures is of Durga a sort of patron-goddess of hers. Durga is one of the coolest of all gods. She rides a tiger. How cool is that ? She has eight arms, each one holding a different weapon which she uses to fight demons and the forces of email. Wow that is so cool. Jesus only has sandals, walks or rides a donkey and touches people to cure them, although the water to wine thing was cool, but walking on water really is of little benefit unless the bridge is out.</p>
Durga's weapons include the standard, spear, sword, shield, bow and arrow, mace, axe and trident, the discus which is a bit greek but why not, and what superhero would be without a thunderbolt. Along with the esoteric and downright bizarre. I imagine the conch shell is used for making noise or at a pinch throwing, or possible for scaring demons afraid of the sea. But a rosary ??? Worry demons to death perhaps. The bell I really dont understand, frighten off demons afraid of Hare Krishna sects ? The noose I can only guess is useful for finishing off demons already suicidal, or possibly lasooing cows. Perhaps the rod is good for blocked toilet demons and goodness only knows what use a lotus flower is in a battle. But my two favourite weapons are the pitcher and wine cup, what better way to celebrate your success.</p>
<p>This got me thinking, what would the goddess of IT carry in her 8 hands ?</p>
<p>Obviously she would ride a sack barrow, preferably one of those with 3 wheels that can go upstairs, all the better to lug around heavy boxes and equipment without damaging her back.
One hand would carry a cross head screwdriver, another a flat head, obviously. The pliers of wire cutting would be useful as would small spanner of sdjustment. I think she should carry a caffeinated energy drink and a set of headphones for those quieter moments. A can of compressed air is good against the ever invading dust and fluff demons but what else ? Ideas ?</p>

<p>/me converts immediately</p>



<h2>ahh there is one other thing</h2>

the ubiquitous rubber chicken with which to wave over the motherboard and dispel the daemons within.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>the Bell</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jaldhar/">jaldhar</a> on 2004-06-18T18:40:23</h3>
Durga ma carries a bell as a representation of a Tantric theory of the origin of the universe from an evolution of sound.  First an indistinct sound, then the word hrim then the word om then the 50 letters of Sanskrit, then everything else.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/the more you know
