<p><p>I've only ever been burgled twice in my life. The first time was in Paris, they took the video (and another worthless bag). The attitude of the police was - we cant do anything, we wont catch them, you wont get your property back.</p>
<p>Thames Valley police have a very different and much more positive attitude. The crime officer came round, took down the details, then sent round a forensics officer. The TV was dusted for fingerprints, the windows were dusted, the front door dusted, the newspaper the thief might have glaced at, taken away for examination, the envelope that had been stepped on taken away for further examination. They even leaned out of an upstairs window to dust the drainpipe the thief probably climbed up to check for fingerprints (and found a nice fresh beauty too).</p>
<p>Apparently we're not the only people to have a thief shin up the drainpipe, there is a cat burglar in the district. They have prints from that crime too and when they pull someone in for something minor and check their prints, the police will have some questions to ask them.</p>
<p>All I can say is well done Thames Valley Police, I'm very impressed.</p></p>
