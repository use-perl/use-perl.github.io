<p>Well, i'm hooked.  OSCON so far has been very fun.  I've met so many people that I'm getting them confused.<br/><br/>On Saturday I went over to Schwern and Ingy's house to hang out and locked my keys in the car *with the ignition on*.  Thankfully their landlord is proficient with long sticks and was able to roll down one of the back windows by sticking it through my sunroof.  Schwern and I went to the airport to pick up Drbacchus around 10 armed with a sign that said "PANTS || E_NOPANTS".  We figured he would know who it was by the sign.  I was wearing my one and only shirt from The Onion which says "Your Favorite Band Sucks" in big white letters on a black shirt.  Between that and holding the pants sign, I got quite a lot of confused stares.  
While we were waiting, we saw a guy with a NetBSD daemon cap on and Schwern yelled "OSCON?!" and the usual geek greeting ensued.  We ended up giving him a ride back which was somewhat of an ordeal in and of itself because since I had locked my keys in my car, I did not have time to clean out the bajillion fast food wrappers and cups from the back.  Luckily, I had a couple of Natures grocery bags in the back which we stuffed completely full of trash.  We then piled four people plus luggage in the car (trunk was full... not of trash) and zoomed off.<br/><br/>Today I woke up at the crack of dawn (1:30 in the afternoon) and blazed downtown trying not to be late and found that the annual Blues Festival was going on.  E_NOPARKING.  I finally got into the hotel lobby at 1:59 by my cell phone to find that the atmosphere around the Bugathon was far too laid back for me to be worrying about being late.  Margaret showed up and hung out for quite a while which is always fun.  She and Piers's wife talked a lot and decided that there might need to be a "Wives of Perl People BOF" next year.
I ended up driving Piers, his wife, Margaret, and I to Chens for dinner which was much more fun than taking the Tri-Met.  I think we managed to stuff three people in the back seat on the way back but I forget who it was besides... arrg! I cant remember pdcawley's wifes name.  Anyway, I came back and closed a bug, went up to the sports bar on the second floor and hung out a bit with schuyler, gnat, dha, and a few others.  Now i'm back at home putting stuff together to take with me tomorrow.
<li>Powerstrip - check.
<li>Wireless card for tobeya and one for ua - check.
<li>Extra power supply for an ibook/powerbook - check.  
<li>25' extension cord (you never know) - check.<br/><br/>Tomorrow should be a lot of fun.</p>
