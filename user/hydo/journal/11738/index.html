<p>Ok.  I can work with this.  No, there's no hint of 'use strict' anywhere in the code.  Yes, when I followed the execution path of the 'Add Transaction' menu option, I ended up with about 10 xemacs buffers opened, but it does work.  I think i'm going to make small changes here and there until we decide if this is what we're going to go with.<br/><br/>On a side note, I missed Leon Redbone playing at the Alladdin last Sunday which makes me sad.  What made me feel a little better was when I was in Walgreens tonight and I saw in the school supplies section a Big Chief.  Those of us who went through gradeschool in the early 80's in the US might have used them.  I always used to get frustrated with them because when you try to erase something with a pencil, the eraser would develop a film of Big Chief paper after a few strokes and you would have to scrape it off.  I dont know why grainy low quality paper makes me miss being in gradeschool but at the moment it does.  Probably a good indication that I should sleep.</p>

Leon Redbone is still alive?  He was <i>old</i> when I was a teenager...
