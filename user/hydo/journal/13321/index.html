<p>I'm going to be pretty bummed when this conference is over.<br/><br/>After making my journal entry about the day yesterday, I decided to install RT and get it configured.  Once I was done and had a few bugs entered, I looked at the clock and it was 6am!  When I woke up I grabbed my stuff and jumped into the car and took off downtown.  I parked in a pay lot a block away which I found out later was a mistake to the tune of $12 as opposed to the $1.25 it would have cost for a two hour pass on the bus.<br/><br/>First I started out just hanging around the lobby talking to people and whatever.  Then sky noticed that there was an ad-hoc network that someone had created with the name 'oreilly' which was fuxing the access for everyone in the lobby.  I downloaded iStumbler and tried to triangulate the person but I didn't have much luck.  Hopefully tomorrow we wont have that problem.<br/><br/>Pretty soon afterward, ua started rounding up people for sushi.  I gave dha, umm... some dude, and some other dude a ride to a sushi joint I had never heard of called 'Madame Butterfly'.  It was pretty damn good.<br/><br/>After that we decided to go back to my place and watch MST3K.  I came up with the oh so clever idea of running an extension cord out to the lawn and watching it there.  We hauled the TV, TV stand (g4 box), the dvd player, stereo and speakers out on the lawn and had a grand ole time.  Hopefully we weren't too loud.<br/><br/>I think if the rumors about OSCON being in pdx again next year are true I will make this a regular thing.  Actually my roomate and I are talking about doing this off and on over the summer since we met one of our neighbors during these festivities.<br/><br/>Drbacchus: "You'd think these people had never seen someone watch tv on their lawn before!"<br/><br/>Yea, I'm sure I will be a bit bummed when the conference is over but at least i'll make every ppm meeting from here on out. =)</p>
