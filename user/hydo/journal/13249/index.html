<p>Finally reinstalled my ibook with 10.2 after another meltdown in the middle of working.  Thankfully I only lost about a half hours worth of work.  I'm going to miss Expose' though.</p>

I'm fairly convinced I won't be buying a laptop from Apple, given the number of problems I've read about within journals here.   Jeesh!

The problem wasn't the laptop.  The problem was that I was running a developer preview of 10.3.<br> <br>My ibook has been the most trouble free laptop i've ever owned and would recommend it in a second.  Same goes for my g4.

I'm pretty sure he means Panther (a beta of it - as an ADC paying member, or as a WWWDC attendee) crashed, not his laptop melted.<br> <br>While I've sent my iBook back twice, I still can't recommend it highly enough.

(Thought I replied to this once already... guess not)<br> <br>The problem was not the hardware.  The problem was that I had a preview copy of osx 10.3 installed and that's what was puking.<br> <br>Apples hardware has been the least problematic that i've ever owned and would recommend it in a heartbeat.
