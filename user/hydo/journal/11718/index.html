<p>I really really really should have looked at the code for this a little closer before I agreed to add a few bits of functionality to it.  It was probably my enthusiasm about being paid once again to code that got me in trouble.<br/><br/>*Much later after I noticed this tab in Safari*<br/><br/>I guess it's not so bad.  I mean, it IS bad, but not as "blood gushing from the eyes" bad as I thought at first.  Any web app that uses a frontend script to exec() another script based on user input needs a dose of CGI::Application or some such module.  I hope I can find my copy of the rhino book.</p>

<p>While I am impressed with its list of features, I am less than impressed with its quality.  I did an internal review of this product for where I work and <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=204342" title="perlmonks.org">I found a few problems</a perlmonks.org>.  Unfortunately, I was <a href="http://www.geocrawler.com/mail/thread.php3?subject=%5BSL%5D+interesting+info.+Do+we+have+to+be+worried%3F&amp;list=7966" title="geocrawler.com">taken to task for this</a geocrawler.com> and the lead developer referred to my concerns as being "nonsense".  That was interesting because I merely listed my conclusions, but not how I arrived at them.</p>

<p>I would love to see SQL Ledger be turned into a good, solid product that I'm not afraid to touch.  (psst<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... maybe you want to write a test suite?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Yea, I read all of that when I got home from the meeting where I said "I believe a safe estimate for adding your changes would be about four days."  Maybe this will finally teach me to research thoroughly a package before I try to make estimates on it.<br> <br>On the one hand, I should have read this before my meeting and been prepared to give a more accurate estimate.  On the other hand, learning this package and getting the functionality they want by Monday is proving to be a fun challenge that I am enjoying more and more.<br> <br>And to answer your question, yes.  I'm going to definitely start that before I edit anything aside from the aesthetics.<br>
