<p>I uploaded a new version of Unix.pm. I tried to address my critics in a polite and reasonable fashion and also made the changes to the distribution that they suggested.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<p>
It's still called Unix and isn't Unix specific. It still lives in the top-level namespace. Ah well.

the new docs do state it was so-named because it was inspired by Unix, particularly the power that its shell holds.<br/><br/>For me, when Quantum::Superpositions came out, I didn't know what it was and its named misled me to think it had something to do with physics. But now, it is clear that it is *inspired* by physical quantum superpositions, but in actually it might be more accurately named<br/><br/>List::Conditional or List::Cases<br/><br/>But what name should this have which addresses your two concerns above?

Usually the CPANites  don't like it when you take
_the_ top level namespace because other people come along and say
<blockquote><div>
"Damn, I wanted to release my module as UNIX::Foo, but now I have to co-ordinate with this guy because he owns the UNIX namespace. I guess I'll have to release it as Foo so I don't have to deal with that hassle".
</div></blockquote>
UNIX::Process::Pipeline or UNIX::Shell::Pipe would be a more suitable names and won't cause the same kind of pain as squatting on the top level.
<p>
Re: Interface<br>

What's unixy about using the word UNIX to get a new pipe? I'd have called it PIPE or redefined "|" if I wanted to be obscure.

</p>
<p>
P.S. Please don't compare this module with Quantum::Superpositions.

I'm not sure I see what the hassle is with occupying the top-level<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... from a build perspective, if someone wants to create Unix::Foo and also have Unix installed, then there is simply a directory called $PREFIX/Unix made for him and Foo.pm put in it. And my Unix.pm would reside in $PREFIX

Maybe you should call it "Sh" if you mean to invoke some kind of comparison between your module and the traditional Unix shell, "/bin/sh".  At least that would be unlikely to be of use to anyone else!
<p>
The problem with taking UNIX.pm for this purpose is that UNIX.pm should be a module that helps you access Unix.  The only reason it doesn't exist already is that Perl is already really good at doing Unixy things...

Please consider renaming your module.  Your reputation as a member of the CPAN community is at stake.

The only thing with "Sh" is that it creates a new top-level namespace and I have never done that to date... I *occupied* the top-level of Unix by creating this module, but I did not create one.<br/><br/>I already have a poor reputation in the Perl(monks)? community and hope to transition to teaching middle/high school math one day. The great thing about teaching Algebra I was that I had complete command of the subject matter. The six weeks I spent teaching high school were the best 6 weeks of my life.<br/><br/>The only problem is the test to qualify to teach math is ridiculously hard... they don't test on high school math at all.<br/><br/>But anyway, I will remove Unix.pm and rename it Acme::Sh.

I note that no-one bitched at me when I put NestedMap in the top level.

I did, but you chose not to pay attention.

In the docs to the new release you say:<br> <br>"It would be nice to have some sort of CPP for Perl"<br> <br>Is there some reason why the -P flag doesn't do what you want?

wow that looks excellent. i wonder why larry opted for the CPP over m4...<br/><br/>however, I have just created a new thing I want to do with this module that would be hard with macros.
