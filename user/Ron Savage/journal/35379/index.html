<p>In the middle of last year I bought a Dell Latitude C400 2nd hand, after using it for about 10 months. It ran WinXFP (sic). And it had a superb screen. So far so good.<br/><br/>Being a small lappie it has no CD drive, and there's only 7 Gb free on the hard disk.<br/><br/>And I want Debian on it, to match my dual-boot home PC.<br/><br/>Well, now I've converted it to dual-boot, but it took a few steps:
o Get into BIOS. Oops. Kbd is locked up
o Upgrade hard disk from 20 Gb to 80 Gb.
o Upgrade BIOS
o Get into BIOS. Oops. There's no option to boot from a USB device. How to install Debian?
o Swap drive into friend's IBM lappie
o He boots from a Ubuntu V 6 disk because he likes the partition editor
o Resize 1 partition to be 3:
-- WinXFP 30 Gb
-- Debian 48 Gb
-- Swap 2 Gb (for a 1 Gb RAM machine)
o Now boot Debian (etch) disk and install
o Reinstall hard disk in Dell
o Boot to command line since X is confused
o Run dpkg-config and friend reconfigs X with great skill
o Reboot into GUI. Yay!
o Spend hours installing desired software:
-- gcc
-- Apache + mod_perl + mod_fastcgi
-- Postgres
-- TrueCrypt
-- Firefox
-- FileZilla
-- CPAN and friends (copied ~/.cpan from desktop)
-- PgAdmin
-- Emacs
-- Open Flash Chart. Yay!
-- Expat
-- A few directories from the desktop
(This makes me think someone ported The Neverending Story to Debian).
o I love flash drives<br/><br/>Almost finished - Time for a swim,
</p>

<h2>More Memory is good</h2>

<p>I bought one for &#163;50, and installed Ubuntu. We gave it to DanDan as his main Christmas present. The major problem was that it only came with default 128MB on board RAM. I bought a 256MB memory stick and then the install was a breeze. It could do with a bit more memory for some of the games DanDan plays, but apart from that, it runs rather nicely.
</p><p>
It's also now Nicole's backup laptop, seeing as her Dell Latitude has developed a fault with the wifi mini-card, and the Netgear USB wifi stick I got to replace it doesn't seem to like Linux<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(</p>



<h2>Dell did UNIX earlier, too</h2>
