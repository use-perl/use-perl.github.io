.conf seems like a bad choice.  The summary of changes is not configuration.  The<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.conf extension does not tell you how the file is formatted, but rather what it is for.  A changelog is not for configuration.  Why not ChangeLog.ini or something like that?  The filename makes the content purpose clear and the extension makes the type clear.<br><br>I don't see the value in the top-level section for version-date pairs.  Presumably the file will always be written out to place the sections in a useful order, and anyone who wants to re-order the sections or deal with them logically will read them in, and can then sort by any field he likes, rather than needing a redundant index in the file.<br><br>INI files do not by default have good semantics for multi-value entries.  While IniFiles might add it, that means that dealing with these files requires dealing with some bespoke data format.  (Well, more bespoke than INI files are to begin with.)  At least YAML has a spec and grammar, and multiple implementations across many languages.<br><br>Whatever super-awesome changelog format is used should be something that people can use outside of Perl.  There *is* life out there.

Hmmm, you make some good points.<br><br>I would argue that a change log supplies config info pertaining to each version, so the choice is not that bad. But I'll certainly reconsider. After all, nothing is cast in Perl-based stone just yet.<br><br>I would like an extension which definitively indicated the format, a la yml and xml, but without the format being known, that's not so easy.<br><br>Changelog.ini is reasonable. That sort of feedback is the point of posting in the first place.<br><br>The date can easily be a per-section entry, and used for sorting, which solves the little bit of unease I had over the all-dates-up-front idea.<br><br>Yes, I realize multi-value entries are problematic. Designing a file format requires balancing that issue against the difficulty beginners are always going to have writing correct YAML. Neither choice (not XML etc) is perfect, nor easy. The pre-existing resistance to YAML is also on my mind. I'm worried chosing YAML will lead to people feeling it's all too difficult, and hence falling back to something ad hoc (again).<br><br>As for using it outside of Perl, I'm hoping the formats I'm playing with will lead to one which can, at the very least, be easily extended to apply to other things, perhaps even the alien libraries underpinning the Alien::* modules.<br>
