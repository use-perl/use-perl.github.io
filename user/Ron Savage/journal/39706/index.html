<p>Hi Folks<br/><br/>After a few detours, I'm slowly building the free time to start blogging on what I've been doing with Perl over the last few years.<br/><br/>I'm going to call my series 'Perl@Work'.<br/><br/>I've almost finished the first article, and have 3 more in mind. These stories are all utterly different from each other, which is one thing about programming I find fascinating.<br/><br/>My first plan for publishing was to go to the Perl Foundation's web site [1] and search for 'advocacy'. I expected to find a place to submit stories, but couldn't see anything.<br/><br/>Then I tried their wiki [2]. Probably the section 'Who uses Perl?' would be the place to put a link to my stories.<br/><br/>But the question remains: Where to blog?<br/><br/>Like many, I'm not happy with use.perl.org, although I do appreciate the effort that's gone into it over the years.<br/><br/>I like the look of Perlsphere [3] so that's where I'm headed, if they'll have me :-).<br/><br/>If not, I'll be back soon.<br/><br/>[1] http://www.perlfoundation.org/

<h2>er Perl.COM ?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/thickas/">thickas</a> on 2009-10-05T09:25:32</h3>
One of the reasons that Perl.COM became regular reading for me were the interleaving of 'Perl success stories' with tutorials, the State of the Onions, and the amazing and much lamented P6 summaries (yes, thanks to all involved in P6 between  about 2000 and 2004 when the initial effort imploded before Autrijius nee Audrey's great leap forward).
<p>
Perl.COM unfortunately lost most of those things. It has been a long while since I've looked at it. I miss the Onions.</p>
