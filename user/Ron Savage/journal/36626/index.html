<p>I'm looking at the problem of drawing labels on a graph, e.g street names, which might overlap.<br/><br/>What I want, so I don't have to write it myself, is a module which takes 2 rectangles defined by their corners, and gives me a Boolean result as to whether or not the 2 rectangles overlap.<br/><br/>I don't want to be tied to any particular image processing software, e.g. Image::Magick, and I don't need the result to be the polygon defined by the overlap.<br/><br/>I can see an algorithm: Take the 2 end lines [*] of one rectangle, determine their equations, and see if they intersect any of the sides of the other rectangle. Then reverse the roles of the 2 rectangles to check the opposite case.<br/><br/>[*] For 2 lines meeting at the corner, it doesn't matter which of the 2 lines is used. So 2 bounding lines of a rectangle which don't meet ought to be sufficient.<br/><br/>Has this been done?<br/><br/>Are there any modules which do part of it?<br/><br/>I searched CPAN for Math::*, but did not see anything obviously relevant.

If I understand your problem description correctly:<br><br>This is a pretty common problem typical of interactive 2d applications (a.k.a video games).<br><br>A good algorithm is really straightforward.<br><br>Search for AABB (Axis-aligned bounding box) and OBB (Oriented bounding box) collision tests.<br><br>Depending on the number of tests you need to do, speed may or may not be an issue. You can speed-up the solve time by testing in the following order:<br><br>1. Do two BSs (bounding sphere) overlap?<br>2. Now, do the AABBs overlap?<br>3. Finally, do the OBBs overlap?

$many x $thanx;<br><br>Your comments gave me much to search for and read about.<br><br>Looks like the AABB is painless and the OBB is painful.<br>

The rectangles _don't_ overlap when one is either completely to the left of the other, or completely below the other.<br><br>A rectangle can be defined by the coordinates of its top-left and bottom-right points:<br><br>So let's say <code>A = (x1,y1,x2,y2) and B = (u1,v1,u2,v2)</code>.<p><blockquote> <div><tt>(x1,y1)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(u1,v1)<br>&nbsp; +-------------+&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+-----------+<br>&nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br>&nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br>&nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br>&nbsp; +-------------+&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+-----------+<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (x2,y2)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(u2,v2)</tt></div> </blockquote> Then A does not overlap B if one of these four tests pass:<p><blockquote> <div><tt># A left of B<br>x2 &lt; u1<br># A right of B<br>x1 &gt; u2<br># A above B<br>y2 &gt; v1<br># A below B<br>y1 &lt; v2</tt></div> </blockquote> So A overlaps B if none of the above hold:<p><blockquote> <div><tt>&nbsp; not ( x2 &lt; u1 or x1 &gt; u2 or y2 &gt; v1 or y1 &lt; v2 )</tt></div> </blockquote> or equivalently (<code> !(a or b) &lt;=&gt; !a and !b </code> )<p><blockquote> <div><tt>&nbsp; x2 &gt;= u1 and x1 &lt;= u2 and y2 &lt;= v1 and y1 &gt;= v2</tt></div> </blockquote> That's too simple to be a module<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>
