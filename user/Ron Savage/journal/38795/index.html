<p>Hi Folks<br/><br/>I've just upgraded YUI [1] from V 2.6.0 to V 2.7.0, and their JSON parser is now throwing errors in code which used to work :-(.<br/><br/>I'm don't quite know what to do next, since I would rather not downgrade YUI, but even that's under consideration.<br/><br/>And no, Business::AU::Ledger is not yet on CPAN.<br/><br/>It will be one day, and - yeah! - has a web interface.<br/><br/>It's designed to replace the only MS Windows program I still use, a free accounting package from the ATO (Australian Tax Office [2]) called eRecord [3].<br/><br/>Teaching C# means I have that installed (both my desktop and laptop are dual-boot machines, in that they run as OS called Debian and something else called Win2FK [desktop] and WinXFP [laptop]).<br/><br/>But I don't /use/ C#.<br/><br/>My module lacks things like handling split cheques, and reconciliation, and a few small details, but is almost usable...<br/><br/>[1] http://developer.yahoo.com/yui<br/><br/>[2] http://ato.gov.au/<br/><br/>[3] http://www.ato.gov.au/businesses/content.asp?doc=/content/39649.htm<br/><br/></p>

<p>You know there ARE other people in AU that know Perl and might have a motivation to help out...</p>

<p>Hi Adam</p><p>Well, you're w-a-y to busy already.</p><p>But seriously, I want to figure out for myself how to solve the remaining problems. The intellectual satisfaction I get from programming is of great importance to me.</p><p>Nevertheless, I mention the module to help people thinking about doing something similar to rather direct their efforts to not reinventing the wheel, even if, in the case of the accounting 'profession', all wheels are square.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/Ron Savage/">Ron Savage</a> on 2009-04-13T03:01:37</h3>
<p>Hi</p><p>Actually, there are many factors influencing my decision to CPAN or not.</p><p>One is the requirement to set a 3-hour exam paper Real Soon Now, and write various lectures, and finish marking (Upload sooner to offload work).</p><p>Another is people who've emailed me suggesting they might use the module (Upload sooner to allow evaluation).</p><p>Desire to make the code as good as possible, to satisfy myself and to preempt bug reports (Upload later to allow self time to finish V 1.00).</p><p>Enjoy the holiday (Upload later since, never having been to church, I have no religious obligations). I'm 59 in June, and thanx for asking<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).</p><p>Having slept on it (deliberately) I've decided to upload it sooner rather than later.</p><p>What I'll do first is change the run mode (it uses CGI::Application) transmission mechanism from hidden form variable to path info style. No point in us all doing that.</p><p>Then I'll put it on CPAN and github.</p><p>So, please hold your collective breaths until then.</p>

<h2>YUI Update</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ron Savage/">Ron Savage</a> on 2009-04-13T09:42:46</h3>
<p>Hi Folks</p><p>I realized the problem which appeared to be YUI was my fault because I was switching back and forth between a CGI script and an FCGID script, without checking that the code generated the correct path info in the latter case.</p>
