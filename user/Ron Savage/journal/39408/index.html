<p>Hi Folks<br/><br/>OK. Padre V 0.41 is looking good. No surprise there.<br/><br/>Here are a few nits I'd like to see fixed:<br/><br/>o The About box beeps, and it's unpleasant. No other app I know does that<br/><br/>o The Doc stats box beeps, too<br/><br/>o A save should create a *.bak file<br/><br/>o A Close [x] on the top right of the output, dir tree, etc windows<br/><br/>o A visual indicator that a script is running<br/><br/>o Interpretation of '>' and '|' on the command line when a script or command is run<br/><br/>o Interpretation of \n (e.g.) when I do a regexp replace. It seems the regexp option only applies to the search string, not the replace string<br/><br/>o An option/button to clear the output window<br/><br/>o Correct interpretation of indent = 4 and use tabs. This appears to work for a new file, but I saved the options and reloaded Padre to test, but loading a pre-existing file with tabs as the first char on some lines, had them displayed with 8 spaces<br/><br/>o An icon, e.g. binoculars, to save having to use the menu to open a search window<br/><br/>Despite these small points, I definitely like Padre. Well done!<br/><br/>I look forward to it having a major impact on Perl's visibility.<br/><br/>Cheers
Ron

<p>Hi Folks</p><p>Damn. Don't you hate that.</p><p>I did not have a note of it (as I did with the other issues), but there is a specific feature of Padre I'd like to praise.</p><p>I can paste clipboard text into the search string!</p><p>So what, you say!?</p><p>Well, in emacs that'd be ^S^Y, but that key combination is deliberately crippled, which is infuriating every time I want it, and that is often.</p><p>So, it's good to know Padre gets it right.</p>

It's misleading to call that Emacs key combination crippled.  Emacs (I'll assume you're using GNU Emacs) has a rich set of functionality behind incremental search: what you want is C-s M-y, which will initiate incremental search and then copy text from the kill ring into the search string.  (You could also use the middle mouse button instead of M-y.)

<p>Hi kings</p><p>Thanx for the reply.</p><p>I'm using GNU Emacs 22.1.1.</p><p>I don't want to copy text from the kill ring. For instance, I might want to drag the mouse across text in another application.</p><p>And, middle mouse button does not, repeat not, paste instead of M-y (after a C-s).</p><p>I do use M-y and middle button many, many times a day.</p>

<p>Hi Ron -- Sorry to hear it's not working for you.  Not to get into a detailed support discussion, but the problem must be related to your environment.</p><p>When a window system (like X) is being used, and you are running an instance of Emacs that's communicating with the window system, then the usual behavior is for Emacs to yank (via, e.g., C-y, or middle mouse button, or C-s M-y, or C-s followed by middle mouse) the contents of the window system's most recent clipboard selection.  So if you type C-s in Emacs, then "drag the mouse across text in another application", then (in Emacs) click the middle mouse button or type M-y, your selected text will be inserted into incremental search.  I do this all the time in X Window-based environments, Windows XP, and Windows Vista, so if your middle mouse button doesn't produce this behavior then it must be an issue with your environment.</p><p>If on the other hand you are not running an instance of Emacs that can communicate with the window system, e.g., you're invoking something like 'emacs -nw' in a terminal window, then chances are the middle mouse button will still work.  For example, right now I'm running an instance of gnome-terminal under X and Ubuntu, in which I'm ssh'ed into a remote box, with 'emacs -nw' running there.  If I select a bit of text in another application (Firefox) using the mouse, and click the middle mouse button in the terminal window, the text is pasted into Emacs, no matter whether the cursor is in the midst of a buffer or in the minibuffer during incremental search.  In this case, the pasting operation is a function/capability of the terminal and window system, not the Emacs process running under ssh.</p><p>So in either case, middle mouse button can indeed paste after a C-s.</p>

<h2>indentation issues</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/tsee/">tsee</a> on 2009-08-05T10:25:43</h3>
<p>Hi Ron,</p><p>regarding your problems with the indentation in Padre. By default, it auto-detects the indentation settings of the currently opened file and adjusts its settings to that. This works very well most of the time.</p><p>If you want to manually set your indentation for all (not only new) files, please try disabling the automatic indentation detection in the preferences and try again. Also, please let me know if that fixed your problems.</p><p>Furthermore, it's currently a little ambiguous what the indentation settings mean and how the desired effect maps to the settings. Tab width =&gt; number of columns displayed per tab character. indent width =&gt; number of columns to use for each indentation level. use tabs (bool) =&gt; use tabs for indentation yes/no. If you set the tab width to something other than the indentation width and enable tabbing, Padre will do "emacs-style" tab compression of the indentation and use spaces only for the right-most indentation level.</p><p>Cheers,<br>Steffen</p>

<p>Hi tsee</p><p>Thanx for the reply.</p><p>Yes, I turned off auto-indent, and it does what I expect when displaying a pre-existing Perl module.</p>

<h2>Creating perl modules</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/link/">link</a> on 2009-08-05T16:04:42</h3>
<p>Padre seems to have a fatal dislike for things that are not perl scripts. If I try to create anything else I get 'C:\Documents and Settings\PSinnott&gt;Can't locate object method "mime_type_by_exte<br>nsion" via package "Padre::Document::Perl" at C:/strawberry/perl/site/lib/Padre/<br>Wx/Main.pm line 4022.'</p>
