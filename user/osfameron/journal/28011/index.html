<p>After greedily watching the best part of Firefly in a weekend, I became slightly obsessed and got increasingly frustrated that, having missed the run of Serenity in UK, it was later than advertised in Florence, ran only for a week I had to return to Liverpool on a Thursday.  (And it was just that bit out of town that I didn't manage to get to it.)<br/><br/>Now though I did finally see it, and was slightly disappointed.  I understand recapping the Tams/crew tensions that were resolved in the <i>Objects in space</i> for the benefit of first-timers.  I also get that myth-rewriting can justify airbrushing out the men with hands of blue (too sillysinister and powerful?), but I was irked that Simon here knows more about River's situation right at the beginning than he discovered only in <i>Ariel</i> and later in the series.<br/><br/>But that's nit-picking, just like my "oh, look, Mal is now inexplicably able to defeat the far superior bad guy in hand to hand combat, <i>yawn</i>" concern: more importantly, the grand secret at the heart of it was unconvincing, especially the reactions (personal and political) to it.  And a general point that there could be many more secrets was glossed over.<br/><br/>Hrmpf, I guess that's also nitpicking, I guess I just didn't get the same sense of fun, adventure from this as from the series.</p>

<p>You should probably read the three-issue <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_(comic)" title="wikipedia.org">comic book</a wikipedia.org> series, one of your gripes gets resolved there (and I won't spoil it for you by telling you which one<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-).</p>
<p>You're right, the film had some major plotholes and most of the TV episodes are better (plot-wise). But I think that's because of the high standard the series set. <em>Serenity</em> is still one of the best SciFi movies to come out in the last decade IMO and among the top-ten space-operas of all time.</p>
