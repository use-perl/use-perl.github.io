<div class="span8">
<p>The first day of the <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ipw2005/">workshop</a> had many interesting talks, but which were rather heavy on the
technical detail in the slides: bepi introduced Mason, and Guido Brugnara later
gave an example of a live site developed in the framework.  Though it was great to
learn about this technology, there was a lot of detail, and the discussion got
bogged down a bit in the finer points of Apache configuration.

<p>

Reinhard E Voglmaier gave an interesting (and again rather in depth) talk on
embedding Perl in OpenLDAP and calling OpenLDAP from Perl (and
<em>complimenti</em> to Reinhard as the only non-native speaker to present in
excellent Italian), and Davide Bergamini spoke on techniques for mailing -
unfortunately I think he attempted too much and due to time constraints was
ordered to "SKIPPA SENZA PIETA`" (skip without mercy) just as he was getting into
statistics on mail delivery and bounces (which I'm interested in for $work).

<p>

And, just to show how I'm an awkward bugger, I thought that the Emotiv
presentation of their rather funky multimedia/mapping application 'il
motorino', and Roberto Baglioni's TT talk (with excellent slides) didn't go into
<em>enough</em> depth on the technicalities.  Hey ho.

<p>

larsen also exhorted the assembled <em>perlisti</em> to contribute to
<a href="http://www.perl.it">perl.it</a> - the organization and, above all,
the website.  

<p>

The second day was even better on the talks front: larsen's talk on automated web
testing had excellent, well designed slides, with great quotes from software
development literature and other sources.  Though the preamble via chaos theory
and quality methodology was great fun (and could have sustained the talk by
itself), it went on just that bit long enough to squeeze the exposition and
demonstration of <code>WWW::Mechanize</code> and <code>HTTP::Recorder</code> (as
promised by the title) to the end.

<p>

dakkar followed with a 2 hour demonstration of the trendy MVC web framework
Catalyst, demonstrated with no slides, but via progressive diffs building up a
basic shop with cart, wishlist, and admin function.  This worked (it really
did) perhaps because for every new function we saw no more than a page of code,
which was clearly doing one thing, which dakkar explained well, and which he
rigourously resisted going off on tangents about.  For example, though I never
really understood the difference between auto and default subs... it doesn't
matter!  After 2 hours, I have a compelling overview of what Catalyst can do
for me, and an incentive to learn more about it.

<p>

mirod spoke on the Perl community, and then onto XML::Twig hacks.  This module
comes with some command line tools which can do devilishly useful things with
XML files:
  <code>xml_pp</code>, a pretty printer;
  <code>xml_grep</code>, which can search using a subset of Xpath;
  <code>xml_split</code> and <code>xml_merge</code> which can be used to easily
edit targeted sections of large files).  Well worth looking into.

<p>

bepi's talk on mod_perl (20 things you might not know) was way over my head
(I know maybe 1 thing about mod_perl), but was well received by the less ignorant.

Emiliano Bruni's HTML::Template talk was a worthy closer to the proceedings, with
a good flow from the mess of template-less web-design, via templating in
general, to HTML::Template in particular.  Also, as a satisfied (but hopefully
not dogmatic) TT user, I liked the module emi has provided
(HTML::Template::Extension) which removes some of the objections that come to mind.

<p>

In other news, I bought an ActiveState Perl Pro license (including Safari
bookshelf subscription) at the auction.  I'd vote against the University
<i>mensa</i> as the workshop lunch-venue of choice because though it's cheap,
good, and they have free beer, the administration took half an hour to locate
the pre-arranged luncheon vouchers, and it was hard to talk over the canteen echo.
The biscuit and coffee breaks were the best though that I've seen at any
conference or training event.  Very few of the talks were in English, but I guess
that's largely dependent on who turns up: only 4 of us (mirod, Reinhard, and B from
Boston.pm - all currently working or telecommuting in Italy, and I) were not,
but all of us spoke some Italian.  
<p>
As always, the best part of a conference is the people you meet.  I got to chat with, among others, mirod and B at lunch, larsen, emi, dakkar, Mattia (wxPerl) Barbon on the Friday night, and dada and [LucaS] (who couldn't make the workshop) in Rome the week before.
