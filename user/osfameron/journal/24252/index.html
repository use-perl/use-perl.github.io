<p>I wanted to change my phone tariff (way too few minutes bundled, so huge bills) - and realized that I could get a free upgrade to 3G phone at the same time.  I got the Nokia 6630 which has nice features though it's ugly as sin and seems pretty fragile and plasticky.
<p>
I upgraded to Orange Premier, mainly because lots of talk minutes, but also was intrigued by the "phone trainer" saying that it had "unlimited data transfer".  Which of course was going to bollocks, but he insisted on this until we had to call up the registration people who precised that it's 1GB data transfer for the first 3 months.<p>
That's still pretty impressive.  (My basic Broadband package is only twice that).  
I don't have land line at the London flat (contracting, didn't want a 12 month deal with BT in case I had to leave) so being able to use the phone as a 3G modem, with a decent data transfer is really cool.
<p>
But, after the first 3 months it goes down to 4MB per month.  Not 400MB, or 40MB.  4MB.  And you then pay ÃÂ£1 per excess megabyte.  So they give you as a freeby for 3 month, something which would cost you ca ÃÂ£1000 ongoing?  This is insane.  If they can offer 1GB data transfer at any point, then they could have a half-decent amount bundled, at least at some reasonably (e.g. not ÃÂ£1000) amount.
Still, perhaps the guy was talking crap again, and there is a way to do this.  And if not, maybe they'll have got their act together in 3 months.
<p>
Oh, and another advantage of Premier is that I get a whole 60 minutes of free video calling.  Which I don't want.  And even if did want, none of the people I want to video call have a 3G phone.  And the phone has the camera on the wrong side to do video calling.  (Yes, I noticed this, and didn't care because of see above).</p>

<h2>Orange data bundles</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/osfameron/">osfameron</a> on 2005-04-19T09:38:20</h3>
Ah, OK, it is possible to get data access bundles (I thought the phone trainers instore were supposed to know their stuff so they could sell to you).<br/><br/>They're called "Orange World Access", and it's
<ul>
<li>&#163;8 for 10MB
</li> <li>&#163;16 for 25MB
</li> <li>&#163;41.13 for 80MB
</li> <li>&#163;52.88 for 400MB
</li> <li>&#163;88.13 for unlimited (subject to fair use 1GB)
</li> </ul><br/><br/>So when salesman said it was unlimited, he was sortof right - it's advertised as that but means 1Gb.  (Though he was wrong about it staying at that level, which would have been great).
