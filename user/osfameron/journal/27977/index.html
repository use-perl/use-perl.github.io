Broadgreen has the reputation of being the better, and friendlier of Liverpool's two main hospitals.  This impression isn't confirmed on entering (the main entrance is unmarked, or rather, it is marked as something else - the CTC centre next door gets an arrow pointing in, while the hospital just has a sign and no arrow.  I continued down the road and had to ask a parking attendant to make sure I even had the right building.  Still, I must have looked confident as I was asked by someone if I worked there (I forgot to check if he was also just looking for the way in).
</p><p>
As I'd missed the main entrance and couldn't see any signs pointing even to the reception, I asked a passing nurse where my clinic was.  "Oh, that's in the new building", she said, before admitting she didn't know how to get in there.  Luckily the woman on the charity flower stall nearby did, and pointed me in the right direction.  The clinic was marked, first with official signs, then with laser printouts, up until a corridor where the trail went dead.  
I waited for another nurse to pass, but she had no idea where it was, though she sympathised about the missing signs, "It's a new building, so they don't like the printouts because they look messy".  She agreed with my desperate suggestion that I use my mobile to call the appointment line on my letter to check with them.  As I dialled, another guy came up and asked the nurse for the same clinic.  While navigating the appointment line menus, the same guy spotted a water-cooler attendant who knew the layout better: it was downstairs.  We called the lift - the next sign was inside it.
