<div class="span8">
<p>I have a problem getting things done.  Over the last few years, I've progressed from a "paperwork is dull and hard, I'll leave it till the last possible moment to do it" to a progressive gnawing  anxiety.  Right now, I'm between 2 flats in different countries and I'm just not coping very well.<br/><br/>So I'm trying GTD.  As the 3 English bookshops I tried didn't have it today, and it doesn't seem to have been translated into English, I've found a few resources online, and it doesn't seem overcomplicated.  I still have to master what has become a fear of actually looking at paperwork - actually, the Mind Sweep going through everything is quite helpful.  (It is possibly slightly unrepresentative, as I've been here for 4 months, and have another 8 or more years' accumulated crap to face when I get back to UK).<br/><br/>I don't have all the stationery, and the local <i>Cartolerie</i> close Saturday afternoon, so I don't even have the famous 43 folders for a tickler file (but I think that's probably something to add later).  In fact I don't have any folders at all, just some multi-pocket folders, which seemed a bit inflexible for the task.
So I've been loosely stuffing things in labeled envelopes and placing the lot in a Moulinex box, which was the right size but opened the wrong way.  After hacking a hole in the top, I realized that it wasn't stable enough.  As I had no staples, I had to improvise with some cable ties threaded through a hole drilled in the two loose sides of the box with a pair of scissors.  In fact, I'm not sure what kind of folders to get.  In one of the articles on davidco.com he mentions not to use a particular type of hanging folder, but I don't get what he's suggesting as the alternative.  Document Wallets?  Or the completely loose folded over piece of card ones (I don't even really get what those are for).  </p>
