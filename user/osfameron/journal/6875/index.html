<div class="span8">
<p>Walking through Liverpool, "the Beatles city", I am always
surprised that <i>that</i> busker is still at it.  
<p>
This is
a young black guy, with karaoke equipment, who can't sing.
Ha can't sing quite loudly, thanks to the microphone and 
PA, and the songs he chooses not to sing are 
irritating lowest-common denominator pop hits.  We get
these <i>in</i> the shops (though usually more in tune), 
and now we have to suffer them outside too.
<p>
In fairness, he has improved over the course of the last
year and a half.  His timing and rhythm are
now acceptable.  He can now sing melodies in tune.
But he still attempts songs that are out of his key and
sings out of tune.  This demonstrates an incredible lack
of self-awareness, and also I think arrogance.  If you
have a limited range, play to your strengths.  If you can't
sing, then learn to sing <i>before</i> busking.
<p>
This, actually, annoys me more than I like to admit.
It makes me feel very petty to be reduced to frothing
rage just because some talentless but ambitious kid
is practising how to become a rockstar and inflicting
it on me and other shoppers.  I want to heckle him
<blockquote>
	You suck!<br>
	Learn to sing, loser!
</blockquote>
I want to write a letter to the local government asking
them to revoke his buskers license.  I want to stamp
on his microphone and speakers until they are 
unrecognizable shards of plastic and metal.

<p>
I think that part of the reason I find this so annoying,
is similar to the reason that some posts on, say, Perlmonks
are given such a righteous beating:

<blockquote>
	I've developed this amazing new cryptographic technique
	in PERL which I'm going to patent.
</blockquote>

Sure, the security point is important too, but I'm sure that
there's an edge of impatience with the poster's lack of 
self awareness and sense of their own limitations.
It's alright to use the training wheels, but you have to admit
that you're in training, and sometimes clear the track for the
serious racers.

<blockquote>
	I've written a k3wl PERL module which I want to upload to
	CPAN called "HTML.pm"
</blockquote>

Know where you fit in in the community.  Is it in a presitigious
top-level namespace, or somewhere under <tt>Acme::Misc::</tt>?
Are you singing in Liverpool's busiest shopping street, or
are you taking classes, doing an open Mic's at Flanaghan's
Irish Pub, and recording a demo tape to send to BBC talent?

<p>

On the other hand, I think that I am also furious about this
because I haven't done either.  I've not submitted a
module even under <tt>Acme::Misc::Trivial::Unimportant::</tt>.
I've almost completely given up playing guitar, and
I haven't written anything, or done any ascii animation for 6 months.
In a sublimation of spleen to inspiration, rant to meditation,
I am going to try to draw something positive from this:
<p>

<blockquote>
Talent is not the important thing, rather the will to learn,
and to make a mark.
</blockquote>

I promise I'll try not to deafen anyone on my way.</p>

<h2>Doings</h2>

I suggest doing things that give you a cheap sense of accomplishment.  Go bake a cake!  It's hard to be angry when you're stuffing your face with cake, especially when you made the cake! <p> I like cake! </p><p> Then suggest that the busker stop singing, and just focus on his "guitar licks".</p>
