<p>Happily, the tuna fish has returned to Rose's sushi bar, hurrah!<br/><br/>I have a digital video camera on loan from my brother, who has decided he
doesn't have anything interesting to do with it (in Kyrgystan) so I brought it
along to embarrass the assembled (larsen, Mattia, Riccardo, Cicci, Emiliano, Simone,
Anshul), stop conversation, and record a mixture of rather dark blurs and some
very bright, slow motion blurs (as this is what happens in the low light mode).
Among the topics of conversation:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>
 Why we should really be using Java (but note to Java proponents, saying
"there's lots of reusable code in the J2EE framework" won't impress most Perl
programmers because by and large they will fall into one of 2 camps: the NIHers
who may at a pinch use CGI and DBI and probably don't see the point; and the
CPAN-addicted, who can't really see how Java has an advantage here.
</li><li>
On the other hand Perl programmers may not say "Java is slow" as often as proponents of other languages (perhaps because we get that too...)
</li><li>
How to order sushi in Japan (bring along a Japanese professor)
</li><li>
some incomprehensible Tuscan muttering about linen.
</li><li>
The best seat in the house at Cabaret Larsen's incredible performance of
   the life and times of Winnie "sex & violence" the Pooh!
</li><li>
The forthcoming firenze.pm technical meet
</li>
</ul><br/><br/>After Rose's, Simone led us to Grom where we enjoyed "Il Gelato di una volta"
and Cicci petitioned the assembled savants for Perl wisdom.  I didn't even
understand the question (serious voodoo with source filters to create a macro
to lock thread variables because you can't use a function as that's in the
correct lexical scope) but Simone after mentioning preprocessor macros with
<tt>perl -P</tt> then suggested this might be an XY question and pointed sagely
in the direction of the shiny `memcached`.  And there was much rejoicing. </p>
