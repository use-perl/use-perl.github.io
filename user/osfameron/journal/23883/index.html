<p>Of course, the iBook was carefully described as "ready for wireless networking".  Me being a little slow, I only discovered later that I had to install the Airport card myself.  It's a user-changeable part, but I still have trouble with the bloody wire thingy not wanting to go in, and I don't understand where the clear plastic tab thing is supposed to go - I hates hardware more than I hates software.

I set the router up for WEP, simple to do, and simple to access from my PC (the config page gives you some generated keys, you write them down and type it in at the relevant point).

If you had a hex WEP key, you have to enter it with a leading dollar-sign.
<p>
Yes, how's that for user-friendly? {grin}</p>
