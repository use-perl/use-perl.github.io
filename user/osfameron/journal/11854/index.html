<p>I wanted to write a Spreadsheet in Perl for some
time.  I do a lot of Data munging for import of
user lists at work, and I've always found Perl
and Excel to be my most useful tools.  Unfortunately it's hard to usefully link Perl and
Excel.  Ideally I'd just replace VBA and plug Perl
in!  So I had a vague idea about actually developing one myself.
<p>
But I didn't have the skills, the dedication, or 
the time so it didn't happen.
Then I learned Java, was being made redundant,
and got a Sony Ericsson P800, one of those all-singing,
all-dancing almost-third-generation mobile phones.  But though it sings
and dances, it doesn't have a Spreadsheet
application.  So my project has now been resurrected as a Java J2ME application... 
<p> I'm aware
that it's still beyond my skills, and (now that
I am no longer being made redundant), my time as well.
<br>
But this time, I seem to have managed to scrape
together the dedication to think about it more
or less constantly for the last 2 months, so I
think it's worth continuing.  If anyone's 
interested I have started
