<p>From the <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com/Interviews/mjd-hop-20050407.html">TPR interview with MJD</a>,<br/><br/><blockquote>MJD: I hope people will buy copies of the book to keep. MKP is nervous that having the book on the web site will hurt sales. I don't think it will, but I'd sure hate to be wrong.</blockquote><br/><br/>I don't of course know how it will work.  Partly because it's more convenient and meaningful to have a physical book, partly because I subscribed to the list and want to support it, I have ordered  a copy and will be enthusiastically reading it once amazon.co.uk actually get hold of it.  I wonder if this is because of the community aspects of Perl.  For example, if a mass market book/album/film I wanted were freely and legally available online, would I download it for free, while paying for HOP because I want to support my club?</p>

Depends. Would you spend money to acquire them in absence of a for-free alternative?

This will be the first perl book I have bought.<br>The fact that I have been able to learn as much<br>as I have about perl for free (as in free beer)<br>has been an important motivator to me.<br> <br>I don't own a computer. I am waiting for the free<br>hardware movement to pass my way. I wouldn't be<br>interested if I were paying. I like hitchhiking<br>too. The fact that everyone is giving me these<br>gifts is great! And that I can beat the system by<br>freeloading is even more exciting.<br> <br>Why will I now buy the book? I think the fact I<br>met Dominus at a conference and he helped me over<br>the Internet with a permutations and combinations<br>problem I had is relevant. The fact the book also<br>deals with permutations and combinations is not<br>as important as the idea that studying it will<br>make me a better programmer, I think.<br> <br>I gave Brian Ingerson a birthday present at a<br>birthday party the Taipei Perl Mongers held for<br>him in Taipei. I guess for the same reason I want<br>to buy Dominus's book. I feel indebted to the<br>people in the perl community who have helped me<br>or whose software has supported my own efforts<br>with free software, I think. The face-to-face<br>interaction was relevant I think.<br> <br>The fact I have an unused book token is also<br>relevant I think.
