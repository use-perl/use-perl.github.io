<p>Perlmonks regularly contains threads where monks advise on the benefits of learning other programming languages.  I've been learning Java, and it's been a whole lot more fun than I expected.
<p>
I didn't think I'd like strong typing, but it does have some great advantages.  (Though I find it annoying that in a modern high level language I have to worry about the different sizes of integers or reals).  <br>Though Java syntax is more verbose and often less elegant than Perl, I'm finding a surprising effect that I seem to be <i>more</i> productive in it because my thoughts don't run away with me before I've properly planned them.  
<br>(In the same way that my handwriting is neater when I write with a fountain-pen than with a biro, because the fountain-pen slows me down and stops me scrawling).<p>
Moving back to what I originally wanted to journal: I've (inconsistently) used Test::More in Perl, and I wanted to start with best practise in Java from the word go.  I downloaded <tt>junit</tt> (not part of the J2SDK but apparently the standard Java testing suite).  It's more or less intuitive, and the documentation is quite good, though I think it over-complicates some issues like the dynamic loading of test suites.  I've tended to develop a 'Driver' framework to test my classes as I write them, so it was quite simple to rewrite them as junit tests.  But I'm really only testing expected behaviour for large chunks of application: I now need to write more white-box unit tests for specific routines and look at boundary cases etc..
<p>
I also got tired of waiting for each of my source files to recompile every time I made any changes.
I've really struggled with the <tt>make</tt> documentation before.  I understand the basics but I've had a lot of pain even tweaking makefiles:
luckily my Java instructor had recommended <tt>Ant</tt> as a make-like tool, so I installed that.  And I was pleased that its build files have a very simple XML syntax, and that it has excellent documentation.  (I read a few comments online saying "Ant's documentation sucks" but I can't say I agree, at least as far as the basics go.)
<p>
I stayed up till way too late customizing my project's <tt>build.xml</tt> to automate testing, create various distributions, archive them etc..  Bizarrely enjoyable, though I suffered sleep deprivation the next day.
<p>
Finally, in a fit of best-practise, I tried to get CVS to work.  I want to do version control, I really do.  But I really think that the CVS documentation sucks and I haven't yet found a decent alternative tutorial.  There is lots of documentation provided, but it just doesn't make sense to me.
<p>
I <i>think</i> that I've worked out how to create a directory structure, and replicate my changes.  But that's it.  I'm not 100% sure how to check whether its maintained my old versions, and how to roll them back.  It could just be that I got burned-out after teaching myself junit and Ant and I need to let my brain rest before diving into CVS?</p>

<h2>CVS documentation</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/tagg/">tagg</a> on 2003-05-14T19:16:41</h3>
I do agree with you - the standard CVS documentation is not the easiest to use. You should take a look at "Open Source Development with CVS"<br>by Karl Fogel and Moshe Bar, which is GPL'd, and available online <a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/" title="red-bean.com">here</a red-bean.com>. I haven't read the new 2nd edition, but the <a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/cvsbook.html" title="red-bean.com">online chapters</a red-bean.com> of the 1st edition are excellent.
