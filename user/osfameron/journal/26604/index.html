Perl's builtin sort function allows you to pass in any function using the magic
variables $a and $b, the reason for this is, apparently, that because sorting
is so intensive, it was too much overhead to pass in normal arguments, and the
magic variables made it faster.  Sadly, this hackery meant that it's also
impossible to pass in a sorting subroutine from another package, because $a and
$b are magically global within the declaring package only.
</p>

<p>
perldoc perlsort advises that you can prototype a function ($$) in which case
sort will allow you to use standard arguments e.g. <code>{ $_[0] &lt;=&gt; $_[1] }</code> rather
than <code>{ $a &lt;=&gt; $b }</code>.  This will let you generate sort subs in external packages
and pass them in.  Woot!  Only problem is, it's apparently much much slower.

<p>
I played around with this and created some benchmarks which sorted an 10,000
element array of random numbers.  Comparing these two with Benchmark

<pre>
  sub sort_arg {
    return sort _sort_arg @array;
  }
  sub sort_ab  {
    return sort _sort_ab @array;
  }

  sub _sort_arg ($$) { $_[0] &lt;=&gt; $_[1] }
  sub _sort_ab       {    $a &lt;=&gt; $b    }
</pre>

gives me:

<pre>
   sort_ab: 16 wallclock secs (15.84 usr +  0.01 sys = 15.85 CPU) @ 31545.74/s (n=500000)
  sort_arg: 16 wallclock secs (16.11 usr +  0.00 sys = 16.11 CPU) @ 31036.62/s (n=500000)
</pre>

<p>
Making $a and $b slightly faster, but not massively.  Of course, the benefit of
using arguments would be to be able to pass in a sort sub.  In which case you
can simply dispatch $a and $b to the sort sub (which means that you don't even
need to prototype the sub <code>($$)</code>) like so:
</p>
<pre>
  sub sort_arg_indirect  {
    my $coderef = \&amp;_sort_arg;
    return sort { $coderef-&gt;($a,$b) } @array;
  }
</pre>

We'll just compare that with an inline sort sub:

<pre>
  sub sort_ab_inline {
    return sort { $a &lt;=&gt; $b } @array;
  }
</pre>

The result of which is

<pre>
     sort_ab_inline:  7 wallclock secs ( 7.96 usr +  0.01 sys =  7.97 CPU) @ 62735.26/s (n=500000)
  sort_arg_indirect:  9 wallclock secs ( 8.14 usr +  0.01 sys =  8.15 CPU) @ 61349.69/s (n=500000)
</pre>

<p>
Again $a and $b are faster, but the interesting thing to me is how much faster
this inline sub style is for both than using the (actually rather bizarre)
named sub syntax as above.  This pair is ~100% faster than the first pair.  But
the difference between the two isn't so big.
</p>
<pre>
                       Rate   sort_arg    sort_ab sort_arg_indirect sort_ab_inline
  sort_arg          31037/s         --        -2%              -49%           -51%
  sort_ab           31546/s         2%         --              -49%           -50%
  sort_arg_indirect 61350/s        98%        94%                --            -2%
  sort_ab_inline    62735/s       102%        99%                2%             --
</pre>

<p>
(These results are for v5.8.4 built for i386-linux-thread-multi, I previously
had similar results on Win32).
</p>
<p>
If these results are sound, I'd draw the conclusion that if you're writing a
module that would benefit from allowing callback sort subs, then there may not
be a compelling reason to ignore sort subs working on @_ purely for historical
speed reasons.

<h2>Trustworthy benchmarks</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2005-09-30T07:30:28</h3>
Be very careful,<blockquote> <div><tt>sort {$a &lt;=&gt; $b } LIST</tt></div> </blockquote>gets recognized by the perl parser as a pattern, and gets optimized away. In other words: the block is <em>not actually used at all</em>, but simply gets replaced by a native numerical sort. As a result, the above code is about as fast as plain <tt>sort</tt> without any block, which does string comparison.<br><br>If you want to compare speed between use of $a and $b vs @_, you should pick a less simple example, one that doesn't get optimized away.<br>
