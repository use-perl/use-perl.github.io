<p>Mark spoke about getting real exceptions (which rethrow uncaught exceptions)
working in Perl.  There is already a solution, Error.pm, which uses prototyped
functions to allow you to pass in coderefs with some nice syntactic sugar.
Which is great, except that, as the coderefs are closures, you can end up
with some objects getting trapped in memory and not being destroyed until
after the Perl interpreter exits, which can cause weird, hard to discover bugs.
<p>
Mark and Tom have got around this by using source filters... Out of the frying
pan, but it's rather cool and handles nested try {} blocks.
<p>
I then spoke about using VBScript at my previous work, and the various
perl-inspired things that I managed to do with it (interpolating strings,
convenient Regex methods, proper arrays, tied variables, and lexical closures).
<p>
Tom gave a nice rant about Perl and Unicode, and introduced us to the
"Snowman in a fez" character &#x2603; (U+2603).
<p>
Ben Evans spoke about POE, which confused me (to be fair, the more I hear about
POE, the more confused I get).
<p>
Nick reported on 5 interesting things he learnt at the German Perl Workshop,
the 6th interesting thing was the comment that the hallway track can be
more interesting than the official talks.

<h2>snowman in fez</h2>

I love that glyph.  Even stranger (in my opinion) is that it lists as a "related character" a CJK Glyph for "snow."
