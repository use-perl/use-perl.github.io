Being a fan of the "English style" Guardian cryptic crossword, I thought I'd
check out the Italian ones - larsen recommended <i>La Settimana Enigmistica</i>, a classic which hasn't changed format since its inception.
In fact at the <i>edicola</i> there are about a dozen magazines toting the
same crossword + rebus + jokes format, though not the famous Settimanale
when I looked.
</p><p>
The clues are more or less straight-forward, similar to "quick
crossword" clues.  Rather than the symmetrical grids of white and
black cells favoured in UK, most puzzles are the American style grids,
largely white, with most words crossed at every point, and very few
blacked out cells (often placed haphazardly rather than aesthetically.)
</p><p>
I think that when I can do one of these crosswords I will be able to say
that I really know Italian.  It doesn't just required a good vocabulary, but also general knowledge - of TV presenters, the
fact that Charlie Chaplin's tramp character is called "Charlot" (with a French pronunciation apparently) and so on.
</p><p>
The favoured layout seems to create a fair number of 2 and 3 letter words.
Unfortunately, there aren't all that many 2 and 3 letter words in Italian, so rather
than change the layout, the preferred solution has been to write really bad
clues instead, and relax the convention that the word be a word.  "Lega
Italiana di Naturisti" --> "LIN", and "Schopenhauer's initials" are 2 of the
better ones.  "Meta' casa" (half the word "casa" --> "CA"), "Gli estremi del
boom" --> ("BM")...
</p><p>
(Apparently the recommended publication had better clues).
</p><p>
There are also barred grids (like those used by Azed in the Observer), and
"self-defining puzzles" like the ones popular in Finland where the clues are in
the non-light cells.  A nice innovation I thought, are the grids where you are told how
many black cells there should be, but not where they are located.
</p><p>
There are also some cartoons, most of which seem to be about how hilarious
it is that women shop so much.  A peculiarity is that when the cartoon has
no words, the editor seems to think it necessary to give the caption
"Senza parole", perhaps in case we would otherwise think the words had
been lost by printers error.  (Which reminds me of an Italian TV guide
which captioned every picture from a film "Una scena dal film").
