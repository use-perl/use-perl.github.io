<p>I arrived at the bank this morning at the opening time of 8:20, despite which I got into work after 10.  Still, having my codice fiscale, passport, work contract, and stub proving I've requested the Permesso di Soggiorno present and correct made the procedure relatively painless.<br/><br/>I have a "conto per non residenti", which means I have to fill in a form every time I pay any money in, but is otherwise the same as a normal account at the Banca CR Firenze (other banks I spoke to wouldn't open a current account for me till I got full residence).  It's free till Jan 2007, after which you have to pay banking charges of EUR 6.50 a month in addition to the 8 EUR that the Italian state taxes you for the privilege of having an account every 3 months.<br/><br/>There are some oddities compared to UK system - you can pay in money at any branch of the bank, but you can only withdraw at the branch you opened the account at.  (I now ask myself - why did I open the account at the brance nearest my temporary flat rather than, say, the one on Piazza Beccaria next to work?  Still, it's only 5 minutes walk).  Withdrawal from cash machines costs, even ones of the bank and group.  There are so many little banks (they haven't all swallowed each other like in UK) - the group I'm with has banks covering "most of central Italy" and Rome, making travel to, say, Milan no more convenient than travelling abroad.  Also, I love the fact that I won't get a Bancomat card till I've had the account for 3 months, instead having to use a 'prepay' card.</p>
