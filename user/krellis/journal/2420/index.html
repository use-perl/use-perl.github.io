<p><P>So...  thinking about buying a $1.2 million property for a combined office/living space.  Very cool location, close to things I need to be close to.  But at $1.2 million, that's, well, rather a lot.  I'm told that's a little on the high side of what it's probably worth, so the owners might take a little less than that, but it's still an awful lot.  I can't even imagine how to get that kind of a loan.  Yeouch.</P>
<P>Well, we've got an appointment to go and have a look next Tuesday, so we'll go from there, I guess.  Maybe it'll suck for the kind of thing we want to use it for, and it'll all be moot.  And I really doubt that Chris is going to approve of a $1.2 million real-estate purchase, anyway.  We'll see, though.  Bleh! :)</P>
<P>Oh, yeah, and Worcester's "online" zoning ordinance guide is just a (badly!) scanned version of the printed manual.  So I can find the table that lists what you can do with differently zoned properties, but I can't a) be sure which column is "BO 1.0", or b) figure out if the things in that column are "Y"'s or "N"'s.  Gotta love city councils "online"!</P></p>
