<p><P><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/triv/">triv</a> and I made a big switch from one database machine to another for <a href="http://www.dyndns.org/">dyn</a> tonight.  It was a bit more of an adventure than it should have been because I couldn't get mysql to compile.  After leaving it for dinner I came back and compiled with debugging symbols to discover problems with the thread library.  Well, that was helpful.  Several head-bangings-on-wall later, I realized I'd been playing with linuxpthreads on this FreeBSD box when I got interrupted by life 6 months ago, and that the configure/compile was getting horribly confused.  Un-installed linuxthreads, re-configured and compiled, viola, working MySQL!</P>
<P>With that hurdle out of the way, everything went very smoothly, about 10 minutes total downtime, with DNS remaining up of course, because our DNS simply doesn't go down :)  The new box isn't /all/ that much faster, it's close to the same hardware, but it's tweaked considerably with some lessons we learned the first time through.  And it's running a shiny new FreeBSD 4.6-RC that I installed on it as part of my troubleshooting before I realized the linuxthreads problem.</P></p>
