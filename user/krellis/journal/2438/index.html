<p><P>I really wish I understood what motivates a credit card company to basically refuse to take my money.  They give me a crappy credit line, then break their authorization system such that, even if you "overpay" (pay off part in the middle of the billing cycle), you still can't go beyond that limit.  So what's the point of letting you overpay in the first place?!?  They'll TAKE the money, but they won't let me do anything with the credit that giving it to them should have freed up.  And then their web site lies to me and says that that credit IS available.  It's just available in some deep, dark void somewhere, I guess.  Argh!</P>
<P>At least the person I just talked to was a LITTLE more helpful than all the others - they won't even normally consider you for a credit line increase with a card that's less than 6 months old (just switched from a personal to a real corporate one), but she told me that if I call during their bank's hours, they can get in touch with someone there to try and get special permission because it's not meeting my needs, and because I pay off the bills, and then some, every month.  Maybe they'll look at the personal card, too, though she seemed to think that it'd be separated because of the fact that they're not both small biz cards.  Grr.</P>
<P>Oh well - they're still by far the best CC company I've dealt with, which is pretty pathetic.  They do tend to have very polite and helpful customer support reps, though, there's just only so much they can do against the evil forces of company policy.</P>
<P>Enough ranting, now it's off to install a new 1U dual tulatin!  Yay, replacing ns1.dyndns.org live.  This should be an adventure!</P></p>
