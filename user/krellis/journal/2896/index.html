<p><P>Well, now it's official - I've resigned my position here at <A HREF="http://www.wpi.edu/">WPI</A> with, of all days, the Ides of March as my last day of employment.  Things with <A HREF="http://www.dyndns.org/">DynDNS.org</A> have just been getting to the point where we really need at least one full-time staff member to handle business stuff, and work on more small-biz-focused services, and I guess I'm it.</P>
<P>My job here was getting to be pretty repetitive anyway, I guess.  Time for a change.  I wish I didn't have to leave the cool people I work with here, but that's just life I suppose.  This will let me get back to some real coding for Dyn, too, which I haven't actually really been involved with for quite some time.</P>
<P>So, if any of you Boston.pm'ers are looking for a somewhat menial but decently paying and pretty secure web programming job in academia out here in Worcester, watch the WPI job postings over the next few weeks.  I'm not sure that they're going to post exactly my job, or something else, but it might be worth looking.  And wish me luck in getting everything sorted out for Dyn! :)</P>
<P>For those curious about what I do, I'll remind you that I don't know for certain that my job will be posted as it currently stands.  I do a mix of stuff, pretty much all writing Perl CGIs, lots of MySQL databases interfaced to the web for various different stuff, other random things that departments in the university need.  Not a lot of really technically challenging stuff, on a day-to-day basis, but there are always the fun little hacks that need to be done, which is the part of the job I really enjoyed the most.  There's not a lot of HTML/graphics involved in what I did here, we have two other full-timers who deal with that stuff.  It involved a little apache conf/administration for me, but that was because I wanted it to - the Computer Center actually handles the physical administration of the web servers.</P>
<P>If you want more info, I'm sure you can find ways to contact me, so feel free to drop me a line :)</P></p>
