<div class="span8">
<p><P>I'm finding it increasingly hard to find motivation here at my <A HREF="http://www.wpi.edu/+Web/">day job</A>.  All it seems I ever do is write the same old database apps over and over.  Add records, edit records, delete records, view records.  Different data, same thing, every time.  It's just so hard to bother to write yet another one.  Especially when it's replacing an existing system that works (mostly) as it is.</P>
<P>I love the neat little hack things, and the cool difficult things where I actually get to think, and I really like the people I work with here...  but it's feeling more and more attractive to go work for <A HREF="http://www.dyndns.org/">DynDNS</A> every day.  I'd feel bad leaving my boss here high and dry, because WPI has a hiring freeze on, and she'd get stuck relying on the computer center people to do my job probably...  but I kind of feel like I'm ripping her off as it is, because I'm really not all that productive here these days.</P>
<P>It's far too early in the week/morning to be thinking, so I think I'm going to go immerse myself in a mindless database until lunch.  Woohoo.</P></p>

<h2>Babbage's Syndrome</h2>

Stay sane by <a href="http://www.foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?toolsmith" title="foldoc.org">toolsmithing</a foldoc.org>.
"I'd rather write programs to write programs than
write programs", and all that.
<p>If it was good enough to keep <a href="http://www.foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?Charles+Babbage" title="foldoc.org">Babbage</a foldoc.org> busy forever [see the Moulton quote in that entry], it's good enough for you!

</p><p>Example:
"I'll make a markup language for specifying database access programs! It'll be SO MUCH BETTER THAN TANGO!!!"
<br>Okay, maybe "stay sane" wasn't quite right.  How about "stay interested"?</p>



<h2>I'll take your job</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajtaylor/">ajtaylor</a> on 2002-02-05T00:34:04</h3>
I volunteer to take over your day job.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) Just think, you'll have time to do all the things you've always wanted to do. Seriously, I'm unemployed so I really would take the job...

LOL.  Wish I could help out, but the aforementioned hiring freeze means that if I quit, no one gets my day job, it just disappears and they get the (paltry) amount they pay me back.

Oh well. Thought I'd try. If they get rid of the freeze and you still want to quit, let me know.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) I could really use a fulltime job (read benefits &amp; regular paycheck).
