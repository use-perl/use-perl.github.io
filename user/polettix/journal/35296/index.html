<p>Yesterday night Roma.pm met to wish best luck to dada and wife, for their imminent Austrian adventure. For such a big happening, we also had the honour to host larsen and dakkar from Firenze.pm and Pisa.pm - they're always a pleasure to meet in person. While Austria is not that distant, I'll surely miss my lunches with dada.<br/><br/>Roma.pm has never been too much active, at least in organising technical meetings. OTOH I've really enjoyed many mailing list threads up to now. Luckly, the emigrants (can) continue to partecipate in the mailing list. The sad part being that plural.<br/><br/>In the last year, dada is the second person leaving Roma for another country, following malattia (which went to Japan). And others went away in the past, like oha which I never met in person. While it's great that they're going to such wonderful places to make their lives better, it's sad for me to think that they've not found what they deserve here, and that I can't enjoy their company. They're really smart people and taught me a lot.<br/><br/>But this is probably a general trend here in Italy, in particular centre-south Italy. Whatever the goverments (*any* government) say, opinions abroad are quite right IMHO.<br/><br/>Anyway, don't think we completely disappeared! We'll continue to have dinners, talk like ner*COUGH*geeks and enjoy life!</p>
