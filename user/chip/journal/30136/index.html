<p><p>YAPC is, among other things, a wonderful opportunity to meet and talk
face-to-face about things that concern us.  This YAPC, one topic was how to
get Parrot development on track to make it the VM we all believe it can be.
One outcome of these discussions is a bit of a personnel shuffle, to wit:

<p>I'm pleased to announce that Allison Randal is taking over as architect of
Parrot, and I'm being promoted to pumpking.

<p>Allison, of course, needs no introduction; as architect, she will flesh out
the vision of a virtual machine for dynamic languages, that's been her
primary interest from the beginning.

<p>I, on the other hand, am very happy to be diving back into the code where
I've learned I'm the happiest.  Writing specs and writing code are similar;
but when you're done with code, there's a "go" button, and lights flash and
wheels turn.  It's the best toy set in the world.  :-)  So, to me, this is a
promotion.

<p>Both Allison and I thank Leo Toetsch for his service as pumpking.  He's done a
yeoman's job getting parrot releases regular and stable.  We're very pleased
that Leo is staying on to continue improving parrot internals.  Now that I'm
going to carry the release cycle burden, he'll have more opportunity to
respond to language implementors' issues, making Parrot better for all.

<p>Onward & upward!  <i>Squawk</i>!
