<p>I never realized until I got my current day job just how much I've been working <i>on</i> Perl instead of working <i>with</i> it.  But now I'm out from under the hood, and I'm sitting behind the wheel instead.  And I'm loving it.

<p>I've been writing a lot of Perl lately.  My current job is a good problem domain for Perl--lots of parsing--but that's not the point.  The point is that I'm not hacking the Perl core any more, at least not often.  I hardly work in C lately.  It's all Perl and shell. 

<p><i>DAMN</i> this is a fine language!  Whenever I think of an abstraction, a rearrangement, a generalization, a feature, even sometimes just a vague concept ... Perl has a way.  It's not always a pretty way, and it's sometimes inefficient or dangerous or even silly; but Perl doesn't stop me.  It gives me all the rope I want, even if I want to shoot myself in the foot with it.

<p>Of course, knowing how the core works is still remarkably useful.  It removes the need for cargo cult or just-in-case programming practices; I don't have to worry whether something will really work the way I want if I know how it's implemented, down to the C function names.  Whether this indicates something weak about Perl or is just a normal consequence of a complex system implemented on top of another system, I don't know.  I suppose I should learn to hack the core of Python, or a JVM, so I can be sure....

<p>Nah.  I've got code to write.  Now how can I factor out this expression here?  Oh, that was easy.</p>
