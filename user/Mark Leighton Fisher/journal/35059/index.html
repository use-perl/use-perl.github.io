<h1>You Can Write Perl in Any Language, Too</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>It is said that "You can write FORTRAN in any language." I say that you can write (within limits) any language in any other language, although writing Common LISP in FORTRAN IV would probably involve first writing a Common LISP interpreter in FORTRAN IV.</p>
<p>As an example, let's take humble VB6. A common Perl idiom is to pass around a set of strings as one string concatenated by <b>join</b>() and de-concatenated by <b>split()</b>. Larry Wall borrowed <b>join()</b> and <b>split()</b> from Basic to start with, then enhanced <b>split()</b> to split on regexes (among other improvements). But non-regex <b>join()</b> and <b>split()</b> work just fine in VB6:</p>
<pre>
    tokenStr = join(passwd, ":")
    [...]
    tokens = split(tokenStr, ":")
</pre>
<p>And quite a bit of the time, you don't need regex-based <b>split(</b>) and <b>join()</b> &mdash; ordinary <b>split()</b> and <b>join()</b> work just fine. (Maybe it is just me, but I haven't seen the <b>join()/split()</b> idiom much in native Basic code of whatever stripe.)
<p>"But what about regexes?" you ask. In Win32 land (as I am), you can use the (essentially-built-in) Microsoft VBScript Regular Expressions 5.5. Though not as convenient as Perl's regexes, these VBScript 5.5 Regular Expressions are about as convenient as you can make class-based regexes:</p>
<pre>
    dim loincMatch as RegExp
    Set loincMatch = New RegExp
    ...
    loincMatch.Pattern = "^\d{1,5}-\d$"
    if loincMatch.Test(field(4)) Then
    ...
</pre>
<p>Everywhere (there is a C compiler) there are <a href="http://pcre.org/">PCRE (Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions)</a>, which truly is about as close as you can get to Perl regexes outside of a Perl program (or plug-in).</p>
<p>Control structures from other languages can be used too (think of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratfor">RATFOR</a> for FORTRAN 66 or <a href="http://search.cpan.org./dist/Switch">Switch</a> in Perl 5). Fortunately, most modern languages have a fairly decent set of control structures.</p>
<p>This is part of the meaning of a Turing-complete language &mdash; anything that can be expressed in one programming language can be expressed in another programming language, although (as I have noted before) you may end up writing an interpreter for language A in language B before you can start using A's language constructs when writing language B.</p>
</p>

I knew about PCRE, but didn't know split, join<br>came from BASIC.<br><br>The way language designers 'port' other languages'<br>features could be called 'incestuous.'<br><br>But that's not really the right word.<br><br>Evolutionarily speaking, it's not 'inheritance<br>of acquired features' but 'inheritance of other<br>monkeys' cool features.'

<p>It&#8217;s not even inheritance. It&#8217;s more like bacterial conjugation.</p>

I think Perl 6 will change the game because it will be the first widely-deployed non-LISP-based language with many cool features now present only in academic languages. I suspect that we will see other languages start borrowing from Perl 6 because of these cool features.
