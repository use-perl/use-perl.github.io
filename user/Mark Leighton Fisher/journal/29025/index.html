<p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(computer_science)">Ontologies</a>
organize the world into categories,
with the hope in the Semantic Web of
reasoning about those
objects and their categories.
It may just be that I haven't paid
sufficient attention to developments
in the field (and if so, feel free to
ignore what I wrote here),
but it seems to me that the ability
of an object to fall into multiple
categories is getting ignored
by current software.</p>
<p>The world to me seems to resemble a
UNIX filesystem &ndash;
dogs and wolves are close enough
species that they interbreed,
yet most ontologies would have a dog
as a domesticated animal while a
wolf is a wild
animal, totally separate from
each other.
Cross-links seem to me to be
a necessary part of being able
to describe the world &ndash;
few among us have not used a
screwdriver to open a paint can,
although those two uses of a
screwdriver are far apart
within the "hand tools" subdomain.
(Somehow, Gerald Weinberg's
comment about, "If you cannot think of three ways of abusing a tool, you do not understand how to use it" comes to mind here.)</p>
<p>IMHO, Semantic Web tool authors
need to account for the messiness and
interconnectedness of the world,
rather than just pretending that
we can stick everything in just one box.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy">Folksonomies</a>
like those used in Flickr and elsewhere
are great as prototypes,
but they fail to scale as the vocabulary
is totally uncontrolled
&ndash; you end up with overlapping
terms.
Typical ontologies, with their strict
tree structure, go too far in the
control direction.
I think that a directed acyclic graph
structure &ndash;
an object can fall into more than one
category &ndash; are a much more flexible
tool going forward, especially
if coupled with the ability of users
to create new vocabulary when needed
(possibly with the help of a
"vocabulary authority" guidance system).
