<p><p>"Doctor!  Doctor!  I just broke my arm in 17 places!"<br>
"Well, for goodness sakes don't GO in those places, then!"<br>
(thereby finishing the introductory joke).</p>
<p>I've been writing some code for a client's application that deals with sensitive data -- sensitive enough that I wanted to avoid printing out the data EXCEPT during testing.
Looking through CPAN, I thought "Aha! Devel::StealthDebug looks like just the ticket!  I can print out the sensitive data during testing, then I can comment-out the code in production so there won't even be a trace of the print statement."</p>
<p>Looking back, I'd just as soon start dereferencing NULL pointers in C as do what I did.  Turns out that Devel::Cover will silently refuse to output any coverage data if you modify your code after you have started testing.  (I had used a kludge of writing fake tests to turn on and turn off the load of Devel::StealthDebug by modifying the code of the module I was testing.)</p>
<p>The workaround?</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a tiny module that exported upon request a function stealth_print() to do the testing printing for me.</li>
<li>Have the fake tests turn testing printing on and off by modifying the code of this separate module.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why, you might ask (or you might not -- I don't know you) didn't I continue to use Devel::StealthDebug?  Because it is currently implemented as a source filter, which (I think) means that it has to be loaded by the module that is directly using it in order to work.  Moving the load of Devel::StealthDebug to a separate module means that the separate module can use Devel::StealthDebug's printing facilities, but the main module cannot use Devel::StealthDebug's facilities anymore.</p>
<p>(Just as a point of interest, I have been programming in Perl for 12 years now but this is my first self-modifying code.)</p>
