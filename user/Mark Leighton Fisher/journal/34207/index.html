<p><p><a href="http://www.macworld.com/2007/08/firstlooks/flnumbers/index.php?lsrc=mwrss">Apple's iWorks Numbers spreadsheet</a> is a step forward in spreadsheet designs, as Numbers liberates the spreadsheet from the 1 table per worksheet paradigm. Multiple tables/worksheet eliminates a whole class of formatting and arrangement problems, as you format and arrange the tables how you please.</p>
<p>Macros &ndash; the code of spreadsheets &ndash; are not yet in Apple's Numbers. (Maybe I can influence their design. (Nah.)) What I would like to see is an additional presentation format for macros in spreadsheets. You would still have the macros in the spreadsheet cells, but you could also view a listing of all macros named by their cell location. Furthermore, I would like to see cell aliases, so you can refer to A4:C1 as either "A4:C1" or "Interest rate".</p>
<p>For Numbers, this would give 4 levels of code/macro organization:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>File</b> -> <b>Sheet</b> -> <b>Table</b> -> <b>Cell</b><br><br> similarly as to how in Perl and many other programming languages we have:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>File</b> -> <b>Class/Package</b> -> <b>Method/Sub/Function</b> -> <b>Statement</b><br><br></p>
<p>Before I would undertake such a spreadsheet macros design, I think I would look at the presentation formats of various math/symbol packages like <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/index.html">Mathematica</a>, <a href="http://www.uts.com/">TK Solver</a>, etc. to see what has already evolved (there's no sense in re-inventing the concept of the wheel, although you may have to tweak the detailed design of the wheel for your particular application). After all, what is a spreadsheet with macros but the common computerized form of a system of equations?</p></p>
