<div class="span8">
<p><p><a href="http://www.fisherscreek.com/open-source/perlping-PL.txt">perlping</a> is a Unix-like ping(1) implementation, using Net::Ping for the low-level ping functionality.  <b>perlping</b> was written because I wanted to install the <a href="http://www.nagios.org/">Nagios network monitoring software</a> on a client's hosted FreeBSD 4.8 system, but FreeBSD 4.8's built-in ping would not accept a ping count argument -- and Nagios needs a count-accepting ping to perform basic "host alive"  checking.</p>
<p><b>perlping</b> takes the following command-line arguments:</p>
<dl>
<dt><i>bind=s</i></dt>
<dd>Bind to the specified interface (using Net::Ping::bind()).</dd>
<dt><i>count=i</i></dt>
<dd>Number of pings to send - default is one.
<dt><i>help</i></dt>
<dd>Prints help message.</dd>
<dt><i>port=s</i></dt>
<dd>Port name or number "s" to bind to - defaults to the HTTP port, 80.  (This default is different from the built-in ping(1).)</dd>
<dt><i>proto=s</i></dt>
<dd>Protocol to use - defaults to "tcp".  (This default is different from the built-in ping(1).)</dd>
<dt><i>verbose</i></dt>
<dd>Verbose results - prints type of ping used and results for each ping.  Default is to print only the cumulative results.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>perlping</b> defaults to connecting the HTTP (webserver) port 80 using TCP, which may be helpful in getting through firewalls that (justifiably) block ICMP packets.  The ability to specify the protocol and port number is also useful for basic connectivity testing of other network services, like SSH.</p>
<p><b>perlping</b> reports minimum, average, and maximum ping times, along with any packets lost.  This functionality is sufficient for Nagios. If the standard deviation of ping response times was needed, you could easily add it using Statistics::Descriptive.</p>
<p>To install <b>perlping</b>, download the <a href="http://www.fisherscreek/open-source/perlping-PL.txt">perlping source file</a>, then type at the command line:</p>
<pre>perl perlping-PL.TXT PERLPINGBINARYNAME</pre>
<p>where <i>PERLPINGBINARYNAME</i> is the filename for your executable copy of <b>perlping</b>.  (All the source program does is install <b>perlping</b> with the configured copy of Perl.)</p>
<p><b>perlping</b> has been tested on FreeBSD 4.8, Windows XP, and Redhat Linux.  It should work everywhere that Perl can use Net::Ping and command-line arguments.  Enjoy!</p></p>

<h2>bug compatible</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2005-03-03T22:00:12</h3>
I've recently noticed a bug shared by at least two different ping implementations.<p>
The average time is computed as: (total of all received ping times) / (number of pings).  This counts dropped packets as having responded in time 0 rather than either ignoring them or counting them as time infinity.  I've seen a report saying min/max/average were 80/120/13.5 - an average of 13.5 calculated from a group of numbers in which the minimum was 80!  The average should instead by computed as (total of all received ping times) / (number of received pings).</p><p>
(Back when I was writing Math contests in high school, the coach would refer to this as "The average must be attained!" to summarize the collection of useful principles: (1) at least one of the numbers that were averaged must be less or equal than the average, (2) at least one must be greater or equal to the average, (3) if there is a number strictly less than the average, there must also be one that is strictly greater, and (4) if there is a number strictly greater than the average, there must also be one that is strictly less.  Often a contest would include questions that were solved using that insight.)</p>



<h2>pping</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/schwern/">schwern</a> on 2005-03-04T19:00:57</h3>
Personally I'd remove "perl" from the name.  Two reasons.<br> <br>1) Its an implementation detail that the user shouldn't care about.  Its not important to the user that its written in Perl its important that its Portable.  Thus pping.  Portable Ping.  And you can still referr to it as Perl Ping if you want.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Same reason I'm so against the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.pl suffix.<br> <br>2) Having Perl in the name can immediately turn some folks off and they won't touch it at all.  If you instead get them using an innocously named program... "Hey, this is pretty useful."  "Yeah, and by the way its written in Perl."<br> <br>With #1 being more important than #2.
