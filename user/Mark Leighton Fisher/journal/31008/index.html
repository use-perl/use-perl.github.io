<p><p><i>[This is #1 in a series of essays about managing informal knowledge ("lore").]</i></p>
<p>What is
lore? Lore is what we know,
but we don't know that
we know it yet. This is
an oversimplification, as
we usually learn lore from
others, and there are degrees
of not knowing what we
know.</p>
<p>A more precise
(if not more accurate)
definition of lore is that
lore is informal knowledge,
often passed on through
informal channels. Lore is
not seen in whitepapers and
manuals &ndash; lore is heard
in hallway conversations and
passed along through archived
USENET posts. Lore is
a hidden grease that helps the
wheels of technology spin
smoothly. Unfortunately,
not everything you need
to know has been neatly
codified and indexed &ndash;
some information is found
only through word of mouth,
obscure FTP textfiles,
and other such unofficial
means.</p>
<p>Personal
knowledgebases are a way
to get your arms around
lore. By "personal" I don't
necessarily mean limited to
one individual (although
those are useful), but rather
knowledgebases that don't
require a 6000-seat Lotus
Notes installation before
any lore can be captured;
more like a wiki and blog publishing
software installed on an
old, abandoned whitebox
server. One software system
for building personal
knowledgebases is
<a href="http://kwiki.org/">Kwiki</a>,
which can be 
<a href="/user/Mark+Leighton+Fisher/journal/29404">easily
built
into a powerful personal
knowledgebase platform</a>.</p>
<p>In the next installment,
I'll talk about the levels of lore (as I see them).</p>
</p>

<h2>lore and ordure</h2>

One person's lore is another's law.<br><br>I wouldn't have called wiki knowledge lore, but one person's lore is another's ordure.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>RE: Wiki Knowledge</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Mark Leighton Fisher/">Mark Leighton Fisher</a> on 2006-10-23T17:03:14</h3>
I guess wasn't clear enough. Wikis are good places (IMHO) to store lore, but wikis have been around long enough that the very knowledge of The Wiki Nature is no longer lore.
