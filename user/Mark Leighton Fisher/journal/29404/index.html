<h1>Corporate Technical Memory Redux: Kwiki?</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/Mark Leighton Fisher/">Mark Leighton Fisher</a> on 2006-04-21T17:04:31</h2>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>A bit of history: in the early days of the Web (1993-1995 or thereabouts),
I developed a Web-base knowledge management Perl application
called the
<a href="http://mark-fisher.home.mindspring.com/ijhcs1.html">Thomson Consumer Electronics Corporate Technical Memory</a>
(or CTM for short).
[This was before the term "knowledge management" was coined
&ndash; which had made it hard to explain why Thomson should spend
any resources on CTM's development.]
Recently, I've notice that Wikis encompass most of the
functionality of CTM as first proposed.
As a CPAN contributor, I have paid special attention to
<a href="http://www.kwiki.org/">Kwiki</a> because of its extensibility.
Kwiki has been extended enough to cover almost all of the
functionality of the original CTM specification.</p>
<p>Bear with me, as I step through the original CTM spec
point by point, noting Kwiki's corresponding capabilities.
</p>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic">
<H2>Inputs to System</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Images (anything on paper) </LI>
<LI>PC files (WinWord, P870, schematics, netlists) </LI>
<LI>Computer programs (source and/or executables) </LI>
<LI>With any new input the author must specify subject, author, keywords,
related documents, outside references, and related projects. </LI>
</UL>
</blockquote style="font-style: italic">
<p>With Kwiki::Formatter and Kwiki::Attachments,
you can have any type of file directly placed into your Kwiki.
The core module Kwiki::Formatter shows images
&ndash; the most common kind of attached file.</p>
<p>Subject, author, and keywords are covered by Kwiki::Formatter,
Kwiki::User*, and Kwiki::Keywords.
Kwiki's linking facilities allow you to include
related documents, outside references, and related projects.
Looks like System Inputs are covered by Kwiki.</p>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic"><H2>System Definition</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The users needs the ability to search by author, subject or keywords. A
browse mode and a content-search should be available as an aid when keywords
are unknown. Cross reference links should be available. </LI></ul></blockquote>
<p>Kwiki::Search handles searches for subject and body text
by performing a full-text search.
Kwiki::Keywords handles search by keywords and author (Kwiki user) searches.
Wikis are Webs, so you get cross-reference links for free.</p>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic">
<ul><LI>The system needs to be able to annotate existing information. A reader
may
add information or comments into an existing document but cannot edit the
original content. </LI></ul></blockquote>
<p>Wikis do this naturally. Kwiki::Comments provides a mechanism to keep
annotations separate from the main page text.</p>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic">
<ul><LI>The system needs to be able to be updated by creation of an a new
document
from an existing document. The existing information cannot be changed even
by
the author but he or she can create a new document as a revision of an
existing
one. </LI></ul></blockquote>
<p>Kwiki::Archive, Kwiki::Revisions, and Kwiki::RecentChanges give
you a handy way to implement source control, which is even better than
the mechanism proposed for CTM.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic">
<ul><LI>A user may request to be notified when a new document is created
under the
keywords of his or her choice. </LI></ul>
</UL></blockquote>
The various RSS modules provide much of this functionality
(maybe even all of it &ndash; I haven't looked at those yet).
<blockquote style="font-style: italic">
<H2>Access</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Who has reader access? Anybody within the engineering community. </LI>

<LI>Who has author access? Anybody within the engineering community. </LI>
</UL></blockquote>
<p>Again, Wikis do this naturally.
Kwiki::User* can be used to provide as little or as much protection
for individual pages as you desire
(as long as you don't need
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Mark+Leighton+Fisher/journal/28418">Kwiki::UserGroups</a>).</p>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic">
<H2>Technical Merit</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Documents deemed to have special technical merit will be included in an
&quot;Authority Section&quot;. This is a continuation of the Authority File
already in existence at TCE. </LI>
</UL>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as I know, Kwiki does not have this functionality.
I don't think I've seen it in other Wikis, either.
Off-hand, <b>Authority Section</b> documents sound to me
to me like they could be documents with special tags where only a few people
are allowed to edit those tags.</p>
<p>Wikis &ndash; particularly, Kwiki &ndash;
provide almost all of the originally specified functionality
of the TCE Corporate Technical Memory.
<a href="http://c2.com/ward/">Ward Cunningham's</a> genius in creating the initial Wiki
(paraphrased as "What's the simplest way to create a website that
could work?"),
along with
<a href="http://www.kwiki.org/?BrianIngerson">Brian Ingerson</a> et.al. work in creating Kwiki,
has built a strong foundation for an easy to use, general-purpose, Perl-extensible, Web-based
knowledge management application.</p>
<p>[Technorati tags:
