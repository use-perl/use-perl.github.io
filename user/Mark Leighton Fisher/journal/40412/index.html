<p><p>If you want to start your own business, you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A product people want to buy; and</li>
<li>The willingness to work amazingly hard to get the business going.</li>
</ul>
<p>These were my major take-aways from 
<a href="http://rondam.blogspot.com/2006/10/top-ten-geek-business-myths.html">Top ten geek business myths</a>, based on the article and my own experiences.</p>
<p>Ideas? Ha!</p>
<blockquote>Don't worry about people stealing an idea; if it's original, you'll have to shove it down their throats. <i>- Howard Aiken</i></blockquote>
<p>What matters more is execution. In my chosen industry, Microsoft has been a good example of this. There were other, better OSes, but Microsoft made sure to get their OSes out on everyone's desktops, rather than limiting the user's choice of PC. Although Linux has made great strides, it is still more likely that you will find a reasonable driver for an arbitrary piece of PC hardware for Windows than for Linux. Microsoft has had better execution in getting Windows out to as many people as possible. (Heresy, I know.)</p>
<p>Even if you revile their products, many of the largest retailers have worked impressively hard getting their products out to everyone, not just a chosen few.</p>
<p>All of what you know is just a tool (a rather large and handsome tool, admittedly) in the process of getting your own business going. Unless your goal is to be a very small, boutique seller, you want to reach as many people as possible, and brains alone won't get you there.<p>
<p>Read the article, and tell me what you think.</p></p>
