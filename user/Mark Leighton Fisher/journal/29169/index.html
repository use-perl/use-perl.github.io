<p><p>Mock objects &ndash; transparently-substitutable mock-ups of objects used in testing &ndash; are a powerful mechanism for testing what can otherwise be intractable systems (think about testing code that uses external sensors or relational databases).</p>
<p>Perl has strong support for mock objects (witness my
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/mlfisher/Test-MockDBI-0.61/">Test::MockDBI</a>),
but that is not true of all languages. This was brought to my attention when I tried &ndash; and failed &ndash; to find a usable mock object framework for either VB6 or the .NET family. All of the mock object frameworks that I found for VB6 and .NET are based on substituting a different class that implements the same interface as the class under test.  This is Not Good.</p>
<p>IMHO, interfaces should be required only when two or more classes need to exhibit the same behaviors (like IO::File and IO::String do in common cases). Classes that need only one kind of behavior should not be required to have interfaces.  Even .NET COM Interop let you declare the classes as
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemtypeclasstopic.asp">AutoDual</a>,
thereby eliminating the tedium of writing a separate interface for each class as AutoDual automagically creates the necessary COM interface for you. Why should mock objects be any different?</p>
<p>VB6 has reached the end of its development and free-support lifecycle. The .NET family has just started its lifecycle, though. I hope that Microsoft pays heed to those developers who find that mocking-up objects is a powerful tool in testing.</p>
<p>P.S. Language is funny; mocking objects would be like, "Your accessors look weird," or "Constructors? *Those* are a pathetic excuse!")</p>
<p>P.P.S.  FWIW,
<a href="http://www.lsharp.org/">L#</a> is a LISP for .NET, but in .NET 2.0 L# will require creating extraneous interfaces when mocking-up L# objects.</p></p>

I'm a<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET guy by day, perl dude by night. While<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET has nice things like NUnit, Testdriven.NET, and code coverage tools, Mocking things in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET is a serious PITA, when it's even possible or practical.<br/><br/>I'm so spoiled on TDD in Perl. You can futz with the symbol table, mess with INC, and do just about anything to mock and create different scenerios.
