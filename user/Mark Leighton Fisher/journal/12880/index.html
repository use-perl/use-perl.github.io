<div class="span8">
<p><P>There are two ways to bootstrap software revolutions (IMHO):</P>
<OL>
<LI STYLE="margin-bottom: 1em">Provide the developer community with detailed free or
inexpensive standards to serve as specifications for the software.
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/">IETF</A> standards often serve this purpose.</LI>
<LI STYLE="margin-bottom: 1em">Provide source code to the developer community
with fairly loose licenses so that developers can either build directly on this
code base or easily create code similar to the provided source code &mdash;
what I call here &quot;Available Source&quot;, where what matters is that the
source is available irrespective of how the source is licensed.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The rise of the Internet was probably a foregone conclusion, but the rise of
the specific technology of the World Wide Web was not. Other technologies
existed that could have provided similar ease-of-use to end-users, including
Gopher, Hyper-G, and Xanadu. Back in 1993 I needed a Web-like technology to
implement the <A HREF="http://mark-fisher.home.mindspring.com/ijhcs1.html">TCE
Corporate Technical Memory</A> (CTM), a document-based knowledge management
application (this was before &quot;knowledge management&quot; had been coined
as a phrase). Only the World Wide Web technology was available for the
platforms I was using (Sun server and Windows clients) with low-cost licensing
(free for the original CERN WWW server software and for the Cello graphical
browser (pre-Netscape days)). </P>
<P>The other technologies I've mentioned had advantages over WWW technology:</P>
<UL>
<LI STYLE="margin-bottom: 1em"><A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1436.txt">Gopher</A> is simpler to implement,
as only one type of document is handled at a time; text is separate from
images, for example.</LI>
<LI STYLE="margin-bottom: 1em"><A HREF="http://www.hyperwave.com/">Hyper-G (and
its commercial cousin Hyperwave)</A> provide two-way linking.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="http://xanadu.com/">Xanadu</A> provides two-way linking and
<A HREF="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?TransClusion">transclusion</A>. 
</LI>
</UL>
<P>So why not Gopher, Hyper-G, or Xanadu? Because
they either cost too much for in-house developers (Xanadu and Gopher) or did
not have the platform support I needed (Hyper-G IIRC). When you want the world
to start using your new category of software, you need to open the door to
other developers so they can add onto (think Microsoft Office) or recreate
(think web servers) your new category of software.</P>
<P>Part of why Expert Systems did not catch on better was that (IMHO) the hype
built so quickly that anyone with a good (or even mediocre) idea about Expert
Systems immediately tried to build a company selling expensive software around
the idea. Companies selling expensive software (whether Closed Source or
Available Source) are not a good place to obtain software for developers
wanting to try out a new category of software &mdash; tinkerers, in other
words. World Wide Web technology could catch on worldwide because commercial
developers, in-house developers, and at-home developers could all
download WWW software for multiple platforms and fiddle with it without having
to justify the expense of obtaining it to someone else. (The other problem for
Expert Systems (again IMHO) was that it is not the be-all and end-all of AI
that some thought it was.)</P>
<P>Sometimes you need to pay a lot for software &mdash; but sometimes you need
to pay nothing for software. When you need 1M+ lines of enterprise-ready code
(SAP and its ilk come to mind), then you will likely want to pay big bucks
because you need big support, big training, big consulting, etc. When you are
starting a
<A HREF="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=skunk+works">skunk
works</A> project &mdash; for example, Web Services in many companies in 2003
&mdash; you will likely want to pay nothing for the software, as you cannot get
money in the budget for that software anyway.</P>
<P>Perl examples of new category software for tinkerers include the original
libwww-perl for Perl V4.036 that enabled easier building of WWW servers and
clients, along with Frontier::RPC that was one of the first
Available Source implementations of <A HREF="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.soaplite.com/">SOAP::Lite</A> which is an
easy-to-use SOAP interface/handler module. The software for new categories does
not have to be Available Source, but it must be either standards-based (with a detailed enough
standard that interoperable software can be easily written) or
Available Source (so that developers can reverse-engineer the software), OR
both. At least since the advent of the Perl 5 module system, most new category
software with a decent standard quickly also becomes Available Source, as a
Perl implementation is soon developed.</P>
<P>In short: No-Cost Standards and/or Software are Necessary for Bootstrapping
Software Revolutions. Academic papers or expensive software are not enough by
themselves to bootstrap a software revolution &mdash; developers must be able to build or obtain the base software at very little expense so they can tinker with the software without needing to show an immediate ROI.</P></p>
