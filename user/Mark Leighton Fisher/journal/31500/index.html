<dt><b>Facts</b></dt>
<dd><p>Much of lore is simple facts.
For example, in VB6, it is lore
that you must test both BOF
and EOF to ensure that
you have an empty recordset
(the set of records retrieved
from a query).
The VB6 documentation
would lead you to believe
that on a freshly-retrieved
recordset, you only need to
test EOF to find out
whether the recordset
is empty. What helps to
make this fact a piece of lore is that
this works
*most of the time*.
However, there are times
when testing only EOF
will lead your code to
try and work with
non-existent records
in the recordset.
Another example
(for my taste) is
the Perl5 lvalue sub,
which from the docs
you would think
that it is a dandy
way to implement
data validation.
Not so, my friend
&ndash; you cannot
examine an assignment
value on the way in,
nor can you verify
the return value
on the way out.
(This is fixed in Perl6.)</p>
<p>Undocumented program feature facts are a rich source of lore,
so much so that graphical features have their own
nickname &ndash; Easter Eggs. However, I suspect that
non-graphical hidden program features, like secret
administrator passwords, cryptic database schemas, and
clandestine command-line switches, 
form the bulk of
undocumented program features.</p>
<p>Another origin of more lore-facts is performance issues,
like BLOBs and DB fragmentation. If I recall correctly,
it has been more than 10 years since database vendors
added support for BLOBs to relational databases, but
relational database BLOBs still suffer 
from performance
problems. The tingling of my architect sense tells me
to look at what is different about BLOBs compared to
other DB datatypes. The difference is that BLOBs do not
fit on a database page, while other datatypes do fit
on a page. Databases are precisely 
tuned for
high speed via sophisticated page-caching mechanisms.
Many table schemas lead to entire rows that
will fit within one page. BLOBs break this rule almost
by definition, as a BLOB is expected to span multiple
database pages. This makes a BLOB much more like a
file in a filesystem than a field in a database row,
which may account for the number of systems that I
have seen out in the field where the BLOB-like data is
held separately in a filesystem, with some kind of
link to the BLOB data as a field in the database.
From what I have seen (or failed to see), reading the
DB vendor documentation would lead you to think that
you should always use in-DB BLOBs for large pieces
of data, while developers seem to continue placing their
BLOB data outside of the DB with only a link to the
BLOB data inside the DB. This is a prime example of
lore (IMHO).<br></p></dd>
<dt><b>Processes</b></dt>
<dd>Processes that are lore usually seem to be (IMHO)
processes inside organizations, as the immediate requirements
of business often appear to preclude getting the processes
written down, even the processes that the business depends
upon. One advantage of ISO 9001 certification is that,
by definition, it requires you to write down the steps
in your business processes. The steps don't necessarily
have to make sense (a weakness of ISO 9001 used by itself),
but writing the steps down is a start towards understanding
and possibly improving the processes.<br><br></dd>
<dt><b>Documents</b></dt>
<dd><i>Undocumented documents? What are *those*?</i>
Again, documents that are lore are usually seen
inside an organization. Documents that are lore
are often what people have written down, but not
seen fit to put under version control or even back up. (Source code that is
not under version control or even backed up is in the
same ZIP/postal code as lore-documents.)
Whether the documents are test results, descriptions
of build steps, development environment configurations,
et.al., if the document is at all important, it should
be under version control and backed up, else it is
at most one hard drive crash away from being lore.<br><br>
<dt><b>Limited-Realm Documents</b></dt>
<dd>Limited-realm documents are a special type of
lore-documents, as limited-realm documents should
be shared across an organization but aren't.
One personal example (of whom I won't name the
organization) is that of separate IT and Engineering
Software groups, which should have been sharing all
of their processes,
design guidelines, post-mortems, etc. but instead it was as if
IT and Engineering Software groups existed in two separate
companies that shared no information between them.
Again IMHO, this is wasteful and counterproductive.</dd>
