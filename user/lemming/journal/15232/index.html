<p><p>I guess it's time to start using this thing.
I'm a bit nervous today since I'm going to be doing a lightning talk at the local Perl Mongers meeting.  <i>Well, unless I chicken out.</i> :)</p>
<p>So many projects for me to organize and actually work on.  The <a href="http://www.kittydream.org">Cat Shelter</a> Site that I put together needs to move soon.  I've got a host, etc... lined up. I just need to go through and move it.</p>
<p>I need to look for a better job.  I don't mind what I'm doing right now, but it's wasting a lot of my talent. And I'm not growing and I hate being stagnate. Sent out my first resume in months.  Hopefully having someone on the inside will get it looked at.</p></p>

<p>Well, I've been lurking for a long time. <br>
And I didn't do a lightning talk.  Wasn't much to add and we were a half hour past the end time, so it was easy for me to justify bailing.<br>
Good talks by the rest.</p>
<p>Now I need to get going with making kittydream.org a bit better.  Just moved the domain from under onsitetech which was hosting it for free to under my wife's account over at pair.com. </p>

<h2>Inquiry</h2>

<em>The volunteers worked tirelessly; seven days a week, cleaning, painting, feeding and loving the cats....</em>
<p>
What colors do you paint them?
</p>
<p>
Seriously though... cat shelter, kudos.</p>

I prefer the color green, but some of the other volunteers prefer red &amp; purple.<br/><br/>Of course when cleaning the cats, one's tongue get's tired.<br/><br/>Hmm, about time I had one of the content people revise the text.
