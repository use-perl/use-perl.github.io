<p>So frustration sank in for the longest time. . .  I had just completed development of one Perl application, and was anxious to get back to another when Other Work Happened.  And so a few weeks/months later, I'm back to that project.<br/><br/>In the time between then and now, I have been trying to get myself a bit better educated.  I've spent a lot of time looking over <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/petdance">Andy Lester's</a> presentation notes and slides on automated testing, and he's also shown great kindness in fielding my hundreds of annoying questions on the matter ;)  It's taken some getting used to, but the concept of "POD, test, code" is really starting to work for me.  It just kinda... flows.  The process has already helped me catch errors for those times when I refactor some code and don't think of everything it might break.<br/><br/>I've also started dabbling with mod_perl, and honestly, it's not been the big scary animal I thought it would be.  I've set up and tinkered with a couple of different handlers, and am starting to get a little feel with how mod_perl behaves.  Today (with the help of <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/samtregar">Sam Tregar</a>, I was able to get an error handler set up for one of my applications.  I've been having a heck of a time trapping errors from the deepest depths of my API, and with Sam's explanations I was able to get a suitable handler working (somewhat based on the work he did with Krang).<br/><br/>As always, I think I got a long way to go in my Perl programming.  But I feel a lot smarter about some things than I did even a few weeks ago.<br/><br/>Thanks to both of you.  You are two people that help make the Perl community so great :)

Answering questions is part of what we all need to do.  When you're in a position where you can help someone else along, you'll do the same.  It all works out.

And really, I think it's only been dozens, not hundreds.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
