<p>What is it with wives sometimes?  Why is it I am getting in trouble for something I haven't done yet?!?!?!<br/><br/>My vacation is quickly approaching (yay for vacations!).  Already, she is griping at me about calling into the office on vacation.  "It pisses me off!" she says.  I haven't done it yet!<br/><br/>I fail to see how a 15 minute phone call is an imposition on a 10-day trip.  Somehow, even if I call when she's in the shower, I know I'll get griped at.<br/><br/>If I were an 8-5 employee, I could understand her being mad.  But I'm not.  I'm an owner, and I have a lot riding on that business.  It doesn't run as well when I leave it alone for long periods of time.<br/><br/>To look at it another way. . . consider going on a vacation and leaving your 6 year old child with grandma for 10 days (DEVNET, coincidentally, is 6 years old).  Do you trust that everything will be a-ok those 10 days, and just show up at the end to pick them up?  No.  You call regularly.  Got to make sure the kid is eating well, staying out of trouble, etc. etc.  In some ways, raising and nuturing this company is no different.  As such, I promised her I wouldn't call every day, but I would be calling some days for a short amount of time (and I'm not bringing a laptop as a show of good faith).<br/><br/>Am I wrong?<br/><br/>In other news, set up my account on PAUSE today.  Fear the new module contributor. . . ;)

<p> <i>am I wrong?</i> </p>

<p>If a man says something, and there isn't a woman around... is he still wrong?</p>

<p>;-)</p>

<p>Seriously tho, it seems you and your wife have a different view about what a vacation is... if it bothers you, talk about it with her.</p>

<p>And, If it doesn't bother you... tough.</p>

<p>Talk about it any way. Chances are she'll appreciate it. (Just lose the 'tude or anything that even remotely smells like one.)</p>

Don't you trust your capable staff to call *you* in the event you're needed?

I know they'll call if there's a problem.  As I said though, it's kinda like my baby.  It's hard to let go of.<br> <br>I've resigned myself to making one call in the middle of the week and leaving it at that.  She seems to be ok with that.  So everyone is pretty happy.<br>
