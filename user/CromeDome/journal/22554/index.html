<p>The whole point of upgrading is to end up with something better than you had before, and/or to fix problems you might have had before?  Someone had better tell that to Linksys.  I am not impressed by my new cable router.<br/><br/>While my wireless connection speed has doubled, my internet connection speed has plummeted.  IM services (ICQ, MSN, AIM, and Yahoo) take significantly longer to connect, and some of my games (most importantly, World of Warcraft) will not play at all.  I've opened all the recommended ports, I've even moved my machine into the router's DMZ (thereby denying myself any protection offered by the router, and thereby letting ALL traffic reach my machine, right?), and it makes not one fucking bit of difference.  If I plug my machine directly into the cable router, the problem magically goes away.  But then I can't connect to my home network, and that's a bigger problem.<br/><br/>A coworker has the same router that I do, but has an older revision of the firmware.  Oddly enough, he doesn't have the same issues, which tells me Linksys' QA on the last firmware release sucked some major ass.  I'm going to try to find a way to get back to the original firmware and see if that makes a difference.  Failing that, anyone have any suggestions?</p>

If you don't have a valid reverse DNS (one that reverses back to the same forward), connection time will suck.  Also, if they're trying to hook up to your identd, it'll also suck.

Is there anything I can do about that?  I assume I'm at the mercy of Comcast, no?
