<p>Some of these aren't necessarily Mac-specific.... but I thought I'd share some of my favorite Mac tools:<ul>
<li>iTerm - I've been holding out on iTerm for a while.  First it was the keyboard delays, then it was the lack of good anti-aliasing, then it was problems with terminal emulation.  All my gripes have apparently been fixed.  I'm loving it like I loved Terminal.app.  Now I just have a lot less clutter.
<li>CoRD - With as many Windows servers as I have to administrate, I have no idea how I ever lived without this.  Microsoft's RDP client doesn't hold a candle to CoRD.
<li>MacFUSE - Nothing like being able to mount remote filesystems over SSH...
<li>MacFusion - ...and having a nice GUI to configure it all with.  
<li>SimplifyMedia - Painless sharing of iTunes music with people over the Internet.  I use it to stream music from home to work, but you can also use it to share music with some of your friends.  No network configuration needed.  It's incredible.
</ul>That's all I got for now.  What are some of your favorite tools?  Please avoid starting any editor wars!

<br>Thanks for this.  I bit ago I decided to pick up a cheap computer for a semi-technical friend who needed one.  I know Windows sucks, but whether warranted or not, there's a lot of resistance to Linux.  And frankly, Ubuntu still gets wedged on dumb apt problems just like Debian does.  (Easy there Debian guys, not a slur, just saying apt doesn't always work for non-technical people.)  So I picked up a cheap $25 Lombard off eBay and put Panther on it.  Short story long, she's not getting this computer.  It's MINE!!  MINE!!<br><br>-scott
