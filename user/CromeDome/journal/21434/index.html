<p>Well, based upon some discussion on the CGI::Application mailing list, I will likely be going through the list of bug fixes and feature requests for CGI::Session and making the changes myself.  The author has been unresponsive for quite some time, and myself and others would really hate to see C::S fester and die.  My intent is to try to make contact with the author while I am making the changes, and failing that, release a fork of the module.<br/><br/>Should I have to fork C::S, my intent is to not break compatibility with the original C::S in case the author resumes maintenance of the module.  Would be nice to just offer whatever fixes and improvements as a patch to his code.<br/><br/>In other news, I spent waaaaaaaaaay too much time at the office last night.  However, I accomplished much.  I built, configured, and installed another server for our support department, configured and installed two new Cisco routers, upgraded our wireless network, and even had time to get a game of Madden in on the company's projector ;)  Left here around 2 in the morning, so needless to say I'm dragging some ass today.<br/><br/>Delight is progessing nicely.  Most of the database implementation modules are complete, and has full test coverage to boot.  Should be starting the interface to the app shortly, and am getting very curious to see how it all comes together.  This is probably the most ambitious Perl development project I've undertaken.<br/><br/>I have also found myself writing code for a site my friend is doing.  It's going to be Yet Another Comparitive Shopping Site, and while I'm not sure how it will do, I look forward to doing it as a learning experience.<br/><br/>And while I am not really much of a fan, go Red Sox :)  Anything to not see the Yankees in the World Series! ;)</p>
