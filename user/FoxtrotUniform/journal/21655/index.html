<p><p>All right, let's get this show on the road.</p>

<p><i>Code Complete 2</i> is a tradesman's guide to software construction.</p>

<p>Steve McConnell likes the construction metaphor for
software development.  McConnell  likes it so much that he's devoted a whole chapter to explaining why it's good and why other metaphors ("Software penmanship"; "Software farming") aren't.  (He says a few good things about incremental development &ndash; "Software accretion" &ndash; then drops the subject.)  This all rubs me a bit the wrong way &ndash; I'm an "agile methods" fanboy &ndash; but I'm willing to chalk that up to my own youthful sense of invincibility and my lack of experience with titanic Big-Company software projects.</p>

<p>Most of the meat of the first four chapters is in Chapter 3: "Measure Twice, Cut Once: Upstream Prerequisites".  At first reading, this chapter is a giant handwave about requirements and design.  McConnell's writing for implementing programmers on large projects, so instead of telling us how to design a piece of software, he tells us what to look for in a good design.  To me, it looks like he's setting up excuses for failure: he doesn't just ask for a spec, for example, he asks for reasons why other specs <i>weren't</i> chosen.  That's reasonable among "software architects", but it's out of place when McConnell has just told the reader that, in effect, "specifying the system isn't your problem".</p>

<p>You might get the impression that I don't like <i>Code Complete 2</i>; that's not quite true.  I don't like the first part of the book, but I'm keeping an open mind about the rest of it.</p></p>

<h2>Keep in mind the scope of the book.</h2>

<blockquote><div> <tt>At first reading, this chapter is a giant handwave about requirements and design.</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>I'll have to re-read that chapter to see what was said, but it seems to be a bit of handwaving on requirements and design is keeping within what the book is about: writing code.  Not designing systems.  Not managing user requirements.  Its about putting the pen to the paper, so to speak.  Think of it like <a href="http://www.bookpool.com/.x/42drzmjib8/sm/020530902X" title="bookpool.com"> <i>Elements of Style</i> </a bookpool.com> for programmers.
