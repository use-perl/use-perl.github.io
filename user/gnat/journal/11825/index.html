<p>I don't generally put <tt>-w</tt> in start-up line. I figure that the average runner of the tool isn't going to care enough to look up the warnings they get, and when I'm testing/debugging I run the script using "<tt>perl -w</tt>" anyway. It makes it easier with shell-history-substitution to add/subtract other flags like <tt>-d</tt>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, anything that is important enough to go from one-liner to actual script runs under <tt>strict</tt>, even if it's only 10-15 lines long.</p>

<p> <i>I don't generally put -w in start-up line.</i> </p>

<p>Me too.  I include 'use strict' in the smallest of scripts, but -w is bloody useless.  'perl -wc ' is great though.  Screw runtime warnings.

</p><p>OH PLEASE WARN ME ABOUT 'use of uninitialized value in concatentation (.)' AGAIN!</p>

I've found that 'use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.)' usually indicates something wrong.  Remember that it doesn't warn if you're just using<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>.=</code> on an uninitialized variable.  It happens, for example, when I interpolate an uninitialized variable into a string.  Do you normally want to do that?

Interesting difference in coding style.  I like to make my programs -w clean by initializing variables and generally being a tidy Kiwi.  That way if I get an "uninitialized value in concatenation", I know something's happened that I didn't expect.  I use Perl's warnings to help me find bugs, rather than treating them as an irritation to be muzzled.  I don't have a high opinion of my programming skills and will take help whereever I can get it!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

Same here, but in fact I've internalized the rules for when warnings occur enough that I don't initialize things that Perl doesn't warn about, like strings that I'm going to use<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>.=</code> on, or arrays that I'm going to <code>push()</code> things onto, or  sometimes booleans that I may later set to true.  And now when I use PHP I get irritated because PHP's warnings are different and I have to do more initialization -- also it isn't as good as Perl at warning about possible typos in variable names ("name only used once").



<h2>Re:I, Heretic</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2003-04-30T14:27:19</h3>
I use -w, and this:<blockquote><div> <tt># this is the worst damned warning ever, so SHUT UP ALREADY!<br>$SIG{__WARN__} = sub { warn @_ unless $_[0] =~<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/Use of uninitialized value/ };</tt> </div></blockquote>I like -w.  In Slash we just have so many lines of code that variables are not always initialized (and frankly, I find that initializing every variable causes a lot of clutter when you already have a ton of lines of code).<br>

Having just downloaded WebMin to have a look-see at how it did what it did, when I was informed that it was made of Perl, I was quite astounded to see that it used the old cgi-lib.pl constructs and stuff that looks more like perl 4 than perl 5 (at least from what little I remember.. I wasn't really around then much but I do recall Perl looking a LOT more confusing back then than it does now)<br> <br>A quick grep through the source found one instance of CGI.pm that wasn't really being used as CGI.pm should be, and nowhere near to the extent of its capabilities.<br> <br>I swear to god, if I had more time on my hands I'd shred webmin and rewrite the entire thing.

<p>...I've had to dig into the code a lot and I've found it's not so bad.  The thing I really wish jcameron had done was to use some kind of template scheme.  Currently html is hard coded in all over the place.</p>
