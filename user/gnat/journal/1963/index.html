<p>The more DVDs I watch, the more peeved I become at the controls.  It seems like every digital video device has its own controls--different numbers of speeds of forward and back, etc.  In particular, I want my DVD player to have the TiVo's ability to go back a few seconds--many times we say to each other "what did he say?"  "what was on the card?"  "are they real?" and the "replay the last few seconds" button is invaluable.<P><br/><br/>I guess the general question is "why doesn't my TiVo play DVDs?"  We're out of space in the entertainment cabinet--between the stereo, TiVo, cable box and VCR, many inches are occupied.  It makes sense for TiVos to start subsuming DVD players and VCRs.<P><br/><br/>Yours in fantasy land,<P>

<h2>Depends on your DVD Player...</h2>

This sounds like a lack of standardization issue, not a lack of feature issue.  Our DVD player (the Sony <i>mumble</i> model) has the "instant replay" button on the remote that replays the last ~10 seconds of the movie.  In fact, we use it constantly to ask "what did he just say?"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
The most invaluable use of the instant replay button was with Charleton Heston's cameo in the Tim Burton <i>Planet of the Apes</i>.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>



<h2>Looks like this is a start</h2>

<a href="http://www.moxi.com/product.htm" title="moxi.com">this</a moxi.com> was released at CES today.  Up to 4 TVs sent digital data from cable/satellite, or from DVD/CD.  <p>

Whoa, and it does FireWire for expandability<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...

<h2>Mplayer</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-01-07T19:41:34</h3>
I use mplayer on Linux to play DivX's (yes, I'm a dirty rotten pirate, but let me tell you a studio isn't going to get my money if it pisses around releasing the Video 4 months before the DVD (Bridget Jones' Diary) or if they pull a DVD off the market for 9 months (Usual Suspects), so there!).
<br>
<br>mplayer has the "skip 10 seconds forward/backward" option, just using the left/right cursor keys. And space-bar is pause. This makes it ideal for watching if you've got a large enough monitor to plug it into, and if you've got a remote control keyboard (which I don't but I'm considering), would be bliss.



<h2>DirecTiVoD</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-01-07T19:58:49</h3>
My RCA DVD player has a back button, which does something I wish the TiVo would do: it turns on closed captioning for the duration of the backed-up time!  That is really cool.  No more guessing at what was said, it's right there on the screen.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<br>
<br>But yes, I have often thought it might be cool to "upload" all my DVDs to the TiVo.  I just need a lot of storage space, right?  Oh yeah, and a TiVo that can output DTS<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
