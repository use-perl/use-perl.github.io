<p>So Jenine picked up that ball and really <a href="http://fort-collins.com/booksforsoldiers/">ran with it</a>.  We've had enough donations to mail several more boxes, and I got a letter yesterday from Brian saying "thanks!".  Woo!<p>

He's interested in a lot more serious literature than I thought he was (he's been reading a lot of American history, apparently) but the thrillers and so on that we've been sending have been eagerly gobbled up by his mates.  He even included a counterfeit Iraqi banknote!  We were all way too excited about that :-)<p>

We just got a call from the secondhand book store that they now have a <i>dolly</i> of books for us, so I think Brian can expect a few more boxes in the near future ...  And with any kind of luck, <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/">Theresa Nielsen-Hayden</a> sent the box of scifi she was talking about.  Speaking of her, check out <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/003495.html#003495">these great signs</a>.<p>

And judging from <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/09/09/sprj.irq.reserves.reut/index.html">this</a>, we'll be sending books for a few more months.<p>

<h2>Where to send?</h2>

Do you know any general military address that we can send books to?

When the war started, the military requested people do not send things to "general" people, only specific people.  I don't know if that's changed.
