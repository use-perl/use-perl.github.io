<p>At 7pm tonight (after darkness fell), I carried the 8ft metal dinghy on my back, rowed halfway across the harbour, cut bait, fished, and then rowed back.  At least one of those directions was against the tide.  I smell of sea salt and octopus (the bait).  Number of fish caught: 0.<p>

I came away with an appreciation for the beauty of a dark and quiet sea, respect for the forces that fill and empty the harbour each day, and a fervent desire to acquire an outboard motor real soon now.<p>

I thought it was 'fish <b>or</b> cut bait'?<br>  You got to have <i>all</i> the fun...

And it was fun.  In a "that which does not kill me gives me something vaguely manly to brag about" way<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  But I am definitely learning how to start and moor the Foam, the much larger fishing boat that my uncle has.<p>

<h2>Looooxury!</h2>

When I were lad, we had t' wait till after midnight. Our dinghy were built out o' stale bread crusts, and we had to use oars made o' depleted uranium. We was far too poor to afford to row <b>on</b> t' harbour; we had to row under 't. And 'twere uphill and against t' tide <b>both</b> ways. As for bait...we <b>dreamed</b> o' cuttin' bait! I remember havin' t' cut me young brother's fingernails instead. They were bugger to thread on hook. And we would 'ave considered catching <b>no</b> fish a looooxury...we was so poor that we 'ad t' release fish back into t' wild. I remember one night I caught -12 cod (the last two using <b>toenail</b> clippings!)

<p>You youngsters don't know how lucky you are!
