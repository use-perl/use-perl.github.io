<p>Another gorgeous day in paradise.  Everybody's flooding in now.  I've been running into people in the corridors: Michele Rodriguez, Stas Beckman and Eric Cholet, Matt Sergeant, Dave Cross, Andy Wardley, Damian Conway, Hugo van der Sanden, Mark Jason Dominus, Allison Randal, Tim Bunce, ...<p>

Registration has opened.  The wireless in the speaker room seems to be dodgy, though this may be user error.  The wireless downstairs was working well, and I ran into Casey there.  I hooked him up with Peter, the ORA networking guy, to talk about wireless networking the pool and bar area.<p>

I'm writing this during the Perl Six Cabal Dinner (there is no cabal).  Damian, Larry, Allison, Hugo, and I.  They started talking about Perl 6 and objects, so I pulled out the laptop to write this entry :-)  They all think I'm studiously taking notes.  To quote the eminent philosopher, Mr T: suckahs!<p>

My family spent a lot of time at the pool today.  It's busyk, but still enough room to play.  Jenine brought a bunch of water toys for the kids--wings, ducks, what have you.  The best part about playing in the pool is that the kids are exhausted by the end of it.<p>

I picked up yet another copy of Mac OS X: The Missing Manual. I say "yet another" because this book has more of a walk factor than any other book I've owned, even Perl Cookbook.  I had Hugo eyeing my copy today--he bought a supersweet TiBook a week ago, and only just opened it up before the flight.  He's still getting the hang of the Dock and System Preferences, trying to work out where everything he wants is.<p>

Saw bright shiny new copies of Mastering Regular Expressions, 2nd edition.  I'm looking forward to Friedl's guru session.  Note to self: have sign made to advertise his session.<p>

Good God, they're now talking about the Manhattan Distance.  Somehow method dispatch is going to involve thermonuclear weapons.  I always suspected it.<p>

Next year, I think we need a checkin board.  I want to know peoples' cellphone numbers, room numbers, and arrival/departure dates.  I want to know who's where and when so I can hook up for lunch and not kick around like a dork hoping to find someone when they've all gone to bloody Seaworld.  Ahem.<p>

Speaking of next year, I'll be glad to leave the hotel.  They've screwed up my room key three times today!  The bloody keys stop working after several hours, and it's driving me (and Jenine) nuts.  Bloody frustrating to be dripping from the pool in your swimming gear, only to be turned away at your only door.<p>

Aha, finally they're done.  Night, all!<p>

The wife just called. My copy of "OSX: The Missing Manual" is sitting in a box that arrived this afternoon. It will never go anywhere that someone could walk with it. Mine I tell  you! Mine!



<h2>Leave the Hotel?!?!?!?!</h2>
