<p>My son's an engineer.  Jenine got the stroller out of the car today, and William said he wanted to get in it.  "No, love, I have to put Raley in it and have you walk.  I can't carry Raley and push you."  Back and forth on this another time.  "William, what am I supposed to do?" asks Jenine.<p>

William looks into the back of the car.  "Put Raley in the backpack and I'll go in the stroller" he says.  Sure enough, the baby-carrying backpack is in the back of the car.<p>

See, all the problem-solving abilities of an engineer.<p>

Then again, maybe he's management.  He ordered people around, made the worker work harder, and ended up with a cushy ride for himself.<p>
