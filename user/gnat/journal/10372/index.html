Where's the Perl equivalent?  I want to write off .NET, but I keep hearing good things about the .NET web forms interface.  And it's always wise to keep up with Miguel.  (As if anyone could keep up with Miguel!)<p>

<h2>Writing off .NET</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2003-02-03T21:19:14</h3>
<blockquote><div> <i>
I want to write off<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET, but I keep hearing good things about the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET web forms interface.
</i> </div></blockquote>
It's been about 2.5 years since<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET was announced, and I have yet to see why we need something like it.  In many ways,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET is simply a glitzier name for C#, and C# is nothing more than Java rethought (with better libraries).  A large portion of the original promise is unrealized and will continue to remain so for a very long time.
<p>
Among the big goals for<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET was the idea of a "common language runtime".  I can see the need for bridging a compiled language and a dynamic language in the same project, but I <i>can't</i> see the need for multiple dynamic languages in one project/application, or contorting many languages into the moral equivalent of C# with differently flavored syntactic sugar.
</p><p>
Most of the benefit that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET promises is available today (and was available 3-5 years ago) as web services (XML-RPC, SOAP, REST, roll-your-own, or UltraOmniSuperHypedML).  That's attacking the same problem from a different direction, and it is gaining a lot more adoption, mindshare and traction.  No, it's not pretty, but it is functional, and it is here and solving problems <i>today</i>.
</p><p>
Even the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET webloggers on oreillynet admit that there may not be a good reason to use<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET today, unless you're rewriting an existing project and want to take advantage of some new whiz-bang feature.</p>
