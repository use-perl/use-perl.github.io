<p>So much for being unaffected.  I was awake for hours last night, unable to sleep, thinking "what happens if *I* got laid off?  We'd be so fucked", going around all the possibilities.  I don't know of anywhere here that's hiring.  Can't move back to NZ because of mother-in-law's dependence on Medicare.  Tried to calculate whether 16 hour days of burger-flipping would pay the mortgage, and decided it wouldn't.  Tried to calculate whether Jenine could work at being a CAD jockey and earn more than the cost of daycare, and realized I didn't have enough data.
<P><br/><br/>What a bloody miserable time to get the shaft.<P><br/><br/><I>--Nat</I> (thanking his lucky stars he still has a job)</p>

Hey, Nat!
<br>
<br>Heads up, keep on going. Don't let these things strike you down.
<br>
<br>Have you finished that PHP book ('cause I'm interested on the Perl one you said would come after you've finished with it!)???<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-))
<br>
<br>Bad things happen all the time. What you have to do is to support your friends, help them as much as you can if they get laid off and keep doing your work. If you stop now, it will be worse.
<br>
<br>If you get laid off, then there's absolutely nothing you can do <b>now</b>. The friends you've helped will help you.
<br>
<br>I don't think you'll have to have your wife doing all the work while you stay at home, taking care of the children.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) In fact, I'll be here, wishing that everything goes fine.
<br>
<br>You just have to do one thing: live the moment. One second at every second. Do not try living two seconds within the same second, it won't work. Believe me.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<br> <br>Be well.
