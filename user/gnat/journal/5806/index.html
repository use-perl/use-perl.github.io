<p>Printing "Perl Graphics Programming" draft.  Had to break into second box of paper.  I never thought I'd go through one box, let alone two, but I guess the last 18 months had enough books and so on.<p>

Nailed down RT talk for OSCON.  Jesse and Robert.  Whee!<p>

Posted YAPC lightning talk spiel, which has generated much traffic.  Hopefully also many registrations for YAPC!<p>

Reassigned rooms at TPC, based on expected attendance.  That is, a big room for Perl and databases, smaller rooms for Java and Python.<p>

Articulated the theory of chapter introductions (must explain what's in the chapter and why it's important) and outroductions (we don't do "Summary" sections at the end of each chapter) to an author, which made me think more about how to do them well.<p>

Took on a bit of work for the PHP Cookbook.  May live to regret this :-)<p>

Answered production questions on the Perl Graphics Programming figures and the Essential Blogging trimsize.  Still no launch date for Essential Blogging.<p>

Connected the recently rediscovered game steering wheel to William's computer so he could drive motorcycles with it.  Happy child ensued.  (it turned up again because Jenine is cleaning out the garage for our first yard sale at this house).<p>

Booked YAPC flights (at last!).  Paid $100 more because of the chaos that is my life.<p>

Gave an answer to another editor working on a Cookbook, who was asking how to handle a Cookbook that gives every answer in multiple programming languages or for cmdline, GUI, and API.  (Answer: in the Solution say "On the commandline do: ..., From the GUI do: ....  From C do: ...").<p>

Got access to the O'Reilly conferences database and played with it.  I don't have time this week to learn how the tables are laid out, but I'm looking forward to building reports that fail to suck without the screenscraping that I've been doing in the past. (All praise LWP!)<p>

Speaking of LWP, I'll have 30 copies of "Perl & LWP" at YAPC, most of which will go up for auction.  They'll be fresh from the bindery--the author may not even have a copy by YAPC!<p>

Signs are looking good that Mastering Regular Expressions, 2nd edition, will be out by OSCON.  And Jeff Friedl will be at OSCON, with a 45m "ask me anything about regexps" session.<p>

<i>Signs are looking good that Mastering Regular Expressions, 2nd edition, will be out by OSCON.</i> <br> <br>With perl 6 still a work in progress, it will necessarily be incomplete or incorrect when it hits the shelves.  (How old is that in computer years?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

When there's an implementation of perl6 regular expressions, we'll consider the book in need of a revision<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

  <em> Articulated the theory of chapter introductions(...)</em>
</p>

<p>
  Does that knowledge ever get documented anywhere or does it just vanish after the editors that came up with it retire?

I've started archiving editorial and auctorial advice within ORA, and I'm building a blog of advice that I can give to my new authors.  Let me guess, you want a copy<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>
