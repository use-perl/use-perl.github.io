<p>Monday.
<p>
Woke up at 8:13 for an 8:30 tutorial.  Wet hair, apply deodorant, RUN
RUN RUN!  The tutorial went well, really well.  I had been worried
that I'd only have an hour of slides, but it ended up being about two
to two and a half.  I was giving an introduction to molecular biology (<A HREF="http://prometheus.frii.com/user/gnat/tmp/tutorial.ppt">powerpoint tuturial</a>)
and had a blast interacting with the three scientists backing me up.<p>

I had read in Scientific American that if you're cornered with an
astrophysicist at a cocktail party, you can always keep the
conversation going by asking "but what about the angular momentum?"
It's apparently an issue in every part of astrophysics.  It turns out
that the same thing for biology is "yes, but surely that's
species-dependent".  Every time I'd state a simple fact, the
biologists would trip over themselves to come up with freakish
examples that disprove it.<p>

Because biological systems evolve, and aren't designed in the classic
Waterfall System, there's huge variation at almost every level.  For
example, peas and humans are diploid organisms--two copies of every
chromosome, so genes can be recessive and dominant.  Bacteria are
haploid--only one copy, so every gene is dominant.  Potatoes have SIX
copies of every chromosome.  Mendel was very wise to use peas to
quantify inheritance rather than potatoes!<p>

Mendel sent his papers to a very nasty professor who alternately
ignored and dumped on him.  The professor recommended that Mendel go
use hawkweed.  Hawkweed is apomictic, a wonderful word meaning that
genes from pollen aren't incorporated into the child organisms.  No
amount of breeding by Mendel would make it work.<p>

So all of this came out of the heckling.  It's cool trivia (and,
indeed, became questions in the quiz show) but it also shows the
enormous problems that computer scientists face when they venture into
bioinformatics.  You can't do anything meaningful without
understanding the data, and you can't just say "oh, this is strings,
I'll just grep it".<p>

I was amazed at how 'up' I was on so little sleep.  I begin to
understand how Damian does it, but I also felt knackered at the end.
I'm amazed he can do it day in day out for weeks at a time.  I'm also
somewhat horrified.  If I can, I think I'll try to make it part of his
YAS grant that he does *not* self-combust this year :-)<p>

Because I didn't have time for breakfast, I was famished.  I went back
to shower after the tutorial ended, then had lunch.  Got to talk with
a British guy teaching bioinformatics to people who know neither
biology nor computer science (my reaction: "what are these people
thinking?!") and then met the publisher, assistant publisher, and
fancy technology guy from Nature magazine.  They were fun--amazingly
fun and open but still really sharp.<p>

The rest of the day was spent writing questions for the quiz show.
Jon was kind enough to rewrite a bunch of my incorrect and malformed
questions into quiz show format, and that let me really get the hang
of it.  I finished the last question 10 minutes before the show was to
start, printed them out, and ran.  To a room with 45 people in it.
Despite the low attendance we all had a huge amount of fun.  I had to
get Jennifer and Cynthia to write last-minute questions after there
was a tie in the first round, which led to fun and hilarity.<p>

Then a bunch of us went back to my suite and we all got wildly and
powerfully trashed.  There was hottubbing.  Security was called.  Tim
fell off his chair with laughter.  It was a *lot* of fun.  To bed at
1:30.<p>
