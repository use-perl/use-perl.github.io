<p>The 1948 recording of "Foggy Mountain Breakdown".  You might know it as the theme to the 1967 Bonnie and Clyde movie.<p>

I had "The Mercury Sessions" CD of Flatt and Scruggs playing in the background, and when Earl Scruggs launched into his second solo (the up-the-next break) it literally brought tears to my eyes.  Wow.  His timing is always amazing (he and his brothers used start playing a tune then walk in opposite directions around their house and meet up again still in time) but there's something about the combination of articulation, melody, and time that is briefly a perfect musical moment that transcends 1948 recording technology.<p>

For me, the best moments are when <em>I</em> am involved in the moment. A recording can never capture that sense of being in the room, and it can certainly never capture the sense of 'taking part' that you get when you're singing or playing your best in the company of others who are also on the top of their game. There's really nothing to touch that.
