<p>Raley's been waking a lot lately during the nights, and Jenine nearly had a meltdown last week from lack of sleep and stress.  So I played the SuperDad card, kicked her out of house on Friday night to spend the night in the Marriott (what passes for luxury accomodations in this cowtown) and looked after the kids.<p>

Raley woke at 1am and 5am, going quickly back to sleep on each case.  I fed her soy milk from a bottle (heating up breast milk was not something I felt I could reliably do at 1am), and she ultimately didn't wake up until 8:30.  William woke up at 7:30, having played hard with his friend Kelton on Friday night and gone to bed around 10pm.  (I feel your harsh judgemental gaze already, as you think "what kind of crap parent lets his 2.8 year old go to bed at 10pm?!").<p>

I got a good night's sleep, got an hour of work done in the morning, and the kids were playing and sleeping when Jenine came back around 11.  She'd had a good night's sleep and was on top of her game again.  Hoorah!<p>

In the morning we went to see "Scooby Doo".  Ok, it's not Kurosawa or Bergman, but it is some good mindless fun.  The trailers and "making of" didn't reveal the ending, and there are some very funny moments.  (Fart jokes, the "nice sweater" line to Velma, Fred in Daphne's body, ...).  William didn't really follow it, and some monsters were a little scary, but it was still a good time.<p> 

Saturday was a lazy sit-around-the-house day.  My parents returned from the World's Worst Tradeshow in Chicago, and we had burgers in the evening.  I like lazy days.<p>

Saturday was Fathers' Day.  My Dad got bluegrass CDs and a book on the Whitbread yacht race.  I got a receiver for the sound system and picked up a $70 speaker set in the afternoon (50W subwoofer is not enough when the other speakers are all 100W, but it was hard to turn down that price!).<p>

It was also my sister's birthday, and we went to "The Three Margaritas" restaurant for lunch.  Fantastic Mexican food, catchup with friends and family (Chris who also had his birthday this weekend came, and our friend Randy), and fun was had by all.  We watched rugby (NZ v Ireland) in the afternoon and in the evening Jenine, William, and I watched "Men in Black" on DVD through the new speakers.  Sweet.<p>

Recent DVD purchases to watch: Black Hawk Down, Monty Python's Holy Grail, The World is Not Enough, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, ....<p>

And now the weekend's over, and I'm back to the grind.  Shawn's turning in the graphics book in a couple of chunks this week, and I have to do the groundwork for my YAPC lightning talk.  Yay, more busy-ness!<p>

"Scooby-doo" made something like 56 million over the weekend - the best June opening ever.  Kids films are in very high demand.
<p>
As for Jay &amp; Silent Bob - fun stuff!  Nasty Easter Egg, as pointed out by <a href="http://www.netflix.com/EasterEggs?id=5111" title="netflix.com">Netflix</a netflix.com></p>

And for the first time I've ever, I'm getting a humorous "the server is down. we'll be back up shortly" page from netflix.com. I guess that's what they get for running Java.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

Was it a Scooby Doo ending?

Yes and no.  They did the classic Scooby Doo ending early on, though, so if you're a fan of the "Old Man Smithers!" "I'd have gotten away with it if it wasn't for you meddling kids!" type of dialogue, you'll be satisfied one way or another.<p>

Me and Jennifer and Riley just hung out at the house, BBQd, watched some movies, hung out.  I got to spend more time than usual with my daughter, being so busy normally.<br> <br>Jennifer and Riley picked out a remote temperature guage for the BBQ: you plug in one end and let it sit next to the grill, and it transmits the temperature to the receiver, up to 100 feet away.  While this sounds merely lazy, it is more than that: when cooking with the cover down, especially on long-cooking foods, you don't want to keep lifting the cover to check the meat.  Mmmmmm.  BBQ.
