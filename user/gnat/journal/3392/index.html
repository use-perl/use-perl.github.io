<p><a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/diaries/book_diary_2002_0306.html">Michael Moore</a> has a blog.  The entry I've linked to talks about the stunning success of his book.<p>

<a href="http://www.wilwheaton.net">Wil Wheaton</a> is cooler than his TV character, Wesley Crusher, apparently was.  I think all Star Trek is stupid, so I never saw him on TV, but he seems a nice enough guy if you go by his weblog.<p>

Now <a href="http://williamshatner.com/billspace/index.asp">William Shatner</a> is getting in on it.  Only his reads like he has a ghostwriter or twelve.  Then again, what ghostwriter worth the pittance he's paid would write:

ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s the joke that all humanity deals with. So we should go along with that irony and perplexing indecipherable humor. Then you become part of that grand laugh we call life.

<h2>Not only is Wil Wheaton cool...</h2>

<p>but I thought his character was, too.  At that age, I needed someone to show me that it was okay to be an intelligent teenager who got along better with adults than his peers.  Wesley Crusher filled that gap for me.  I never could believe how people were always bashing the character.</p>

<p>Wil, if by some chance you read this: thanks!</p>

Lessee.  There were the two seasons where the universe was about to implode in almost every episode, and miraculously Wesley comes in at the last minute to save the day.  Then there were the two seasons where the universe was going along swimmingly, except when Wesley Crusher came onto the set, and things were about to implode, but somehow managed not to (thanks to Q, Jean-Luc and No. 2).
<p>
Oh, and there was the underlying theme to his character that somehow a teenager was wiser than all of starfleet, yet tragically misunderstood.

Nah.  The series was much better when Vulcans had a pale green tint to their skin...</p>

<p>Sorry.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I doubt such a debate could happen because I'm not interested in debating the merits of Wesley Crusher (which I why I never responded), and no one else will defend him.</p>
