<p>Quick!  It's February, you've moved to New Zealand for three months, the bandwidth to your house is crap, what do you do?  WHAT DO YOU DO?!<p>

I don't know what <i>you</i> do, but I talked to my old high school and have begun working from there.  It's fun, I get to commute on the school bus, I hang out with my old computing teacher who is now the IT guy for the school, and build web page frontends to Filemaker in spare time as virtual rent.  In return I get their DSL pipe which enables me to do voice iChat and avoid the $800 of international phone calls I racked up last year.<p>

I get to hear some great stuff on the school bus.  The first day I was on, I heard this:

<blockquote>
Kid 1: "Look, there goes BJ.  Nyah, BJ!"<br>
Kid 2: "Why would you call yourself BJ?"<br>
Kid 3: "His name is Bernard something."<br>
Kid 2:" Yeah, but why would you call yourself BJ?"<br>
Kid 3: "Would you want to call yourself Bernard?"<br>
Kid 2: "Nah, but with BJ kids'd call you `Bum Juice'."
</blockquote>

Cracked me up.  Today I heard "cool your horms" where "horms" == "hormones".  It's good to have comic relief to distract me from OSCON.<p>

Somethign tells me that that kind of humor is right up your ally, Nat!<br> <br>Regards,<br> <br>David



<h2>Careful with that thar DSL pipe thingy!</h2>

Does the school get free or flat rate DSL?  I sure hope so.  The rest of us are currently paying 20c/MB for all traffic over the ridiculously low usage cap (1GB/month on my plan) - such are the joys of a monopoly supplier in a deregulated market.  I hope your voice chatting doesn't end up costing the school a fortune.

The school pays 5c/MB over their limit.  So a gig of traffic will cost the school (and eventually O'Reilly) $50.  He's watching the router pretty closely to figure out what I'm doing. <p>

I'm <i>horrified</i> by the pricing system here.  It's incredibly painful to try and get high speed access at my house.  No wonder there are so few NZ open source hackers.</p><p>

I also wonder how Mac and Windows users fare, with network-downloadable updates.  Who the hell wants to pay for the traffic of downloading all those updates from America?  It seems stupid that when you set your location, you can't say "grab the updates from here" and use a local mirror.</p><p>
