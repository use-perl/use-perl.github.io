<p>"Cartoon Guide to Genetics".  All the cartoon guides are great, but this one was really useful for my <A HREF="http://conferences.oreilly.com/biocon/">bioinformatics</A> boot camp study.  It came almost too late, but if I'd read it two months ago, I could have saved myself two months of pounding my head against textbooks.<P><br/><br/>Then again, now I do have an impressive number of textbooks.  And there's nothing quite like that feeling of being at school, where you are interested and excited in a subject you're new to.  It's been 11 years since I entered university (a figure that makes me OSHIT every time I calculate it) and I've really enjoyed the feeling of learning something completely new.<P><br/><br/>I've also enjoyed <A HREF="http://www.parrotcode.org/">Parrot</A> hacking.  It's taking me back to the 6502 days (*twenty* years ago!  OSHIT!) and it's fun.  I've always thought that I benefitted from learning the low level as well as the high, but I feel like I'm confirming that when I go back to assembly.  I feel like my Perl programming is informing my assembly now, just as my knowledge of the underlying machine (addressed memory, integer registers, and so on) informed my programming in Perl.<P><br/><br/>I've already begun planning OSCON 2002.  Some days I feel like I'm trapped on a wheel, and no matter how fast I run, I can never take a break.  Still, I do get to have a lot of (exhausting) fun at the actual conference, so I can't complain.<P><br/><br/>The ISP that is my former employer just laid off some of my friends, and HP is winding up to lay off another friend.  Ugh, I hate this economic suck phase we're in.  I know too many good people hunting for work in Boston, England, and now Fort Collins, Colorado.  Where's their $5 billion dollar bail-out?<P><br/><br/>Still, some good news in all that--<A HREF="http://forum.swarthmore.edu/epigone/modperl/zhyzhendrou/3BAA2755.9080701@stason.org">Stas Bekman</A> is being funded for a year's work on mod_perl 2.0, a new documentation project (he's the brains behind the mod_perl guide).  Major kudos to Ticketmaster, who's behind the funding.<P><br/><br/>And, finally, it's 13 days and counting to the new baby's due date.  Whee!  Now if I could only pull a miracle and get both the SOAP book and the PHP book I'm editing into production ....  Well, I can dream!<P><br/><br/><I>--Nat</I></p>
