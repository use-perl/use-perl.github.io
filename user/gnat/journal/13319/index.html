<p>(addendum to Sunday: went to the bar for 45 minutes, had a drink and chatted with obra, Paul Grassie, and others.  Jesse (obra) has a great story about how much sex other people have had from his software--well worth the price of a beer if you're ever in the same bar as him ...)<p>

Things that went well on Monday:
<ul>
<li>Kids (no more meltdowns, and Jenine had 'em for all the day)
<li>Registration (until the network went down, see below)
<li>People (#perl, p5p, perl6, and civilians--I met one guy who's attended the last FOUR conferences!  That has to be worth a medal!)
<li>Sessions (I did my time in the Perl testing tutorial)
<li><a href="http://oscon.kwiki.org/">the wiki</a> (I'm a convert)
</ul>

What didn't go well
<ul>
<li>network (UDP floods and poorly-worded "turn off mDNS!" warnings)
<li>food (the lack thereof was disconcerting to folks)
<li>the hunt for icecream tonight (a lot of the route we wanted to take was under construction, but thanks to Allison for persistence and taking on the almost-thankless task of finding me an affordable sugar fix)
<li>the book store (Powell's opened without O'Reilly books, their shipment having been delayed --so the bookstore at the O'Reilly conference had (for a brief while) no O'Reilly books!  All fixed now, though)
</ul>
