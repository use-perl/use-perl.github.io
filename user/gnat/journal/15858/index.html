<div class="span8">
<p>I'd forgotten how much fun it is to code.  Somehow, hanging around the PHP folks, as they sit around and casually program while chatting, reawakens the dormant hacker in me. I don't know why, but the same thing happened last year.<p>

So this evening, while those who had money were off seeing Zumanity (Cirque du Soleil, n3kk1d), I started hacking again.  I have about 1/3 of a POP3 server written in Perl.  I got sidetracked halfway through and started playing with Apple's AddressBook API in C.<p>

What I learned is that I really like Perl.  Perl hides a lot of stuff that you really shouldn't have to think about.  Like strings, for example.  I can't believe how amazingly painful it is to just print a list of the names of people in your address book.  This is, I suspect, a byproduct of using the CoreFoundation classes for strings, but I'm forced to because that's what AddressBook does.<p>

Check it out:<p>

<pre>

  for (i=0; i < count; i++) {
    ABPersonRef thisPerson;
    CFStringRef firstNameCF, lastNameCF;
    CFDataRef   firstNameDR, lastNameDR;
    CFIndex     firstNameLength, lastNameLength;

    thisPerson = (ABPersonRef) CFArrayGetValueAtIndex(array, i);
    firstNameCF = ABRecordCopyValue(thisPerson, kABFirstNameProperty);
    if (firstNameCF) {
      firstNameLength = CFStringGetLength(firstNameCF);
      firstNameDR = CFStringCreateExternalRepresentation(NULL, firstNameCF, CFStringGetSystemEncoding(), '?');
      printf("%.*s ",
             (int)CFDataGetLength(firstNameDR), CFDataGetBytePtr(firstNameDR));
      CFRelease(firstNameDR);
      CFRelease(firstNameCF);
    }

    lastNameCF = ABRecordCopyValue(thisPerson, kABLastNameProperty);
    if (lastNameCF) {
      lastNameLength = CFStringGetLength(lastNameCF);
      lastNameDR = CFStringCreateExternalRepresentation(NULL, lastNameCF, CFStringGetSystemEncoding(), '?');
      printf("%.*s", 
             (int)CFDataGetLength(lastNameDR), CFDataGetBytePtr(lastNameDR));
      CFRelease(lastNameDR);
      CFRelease(lastNameCF);
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
</pre>

All that, just to do the equivalent of:

<pre>
  foreach my $thisPerson (@array) {
    $firstName = $thisPerson->{firstName} || "";
    $lastName = $thisPerson->{lastName} || "";
    print "$firstName $lastName\n";
  }
</pre>

How can anyone program in this ridiculous quagmire of strings, C strings, data references, ... ?  I seriously hope there's an easier way that I'm missing.<p>

<h2>Avoid the CoreFoundation</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2003-11-19T23:33:50</h3>
Why would you <i>ever</i> code against the CF* APIs?  It's for masochists, foot-draggers, and hackers working at a low level.  For anything serious, you really should be using the ObjC frameworks.  If you're into that much pain, go buy the new Brittany album instead.
<p>
Here's the same code using the AddressBook framework.  Note how it's almost Perl-like in a perverse kind of way:</p><blockquote><div> <tt>#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;<br>#import &lt;AddressBook/AddressBook.h&gt;<br> <br>void dump_ab_people() {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; NSArray *people = [[ABAddressBook sharedAddressBook] people];<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; NSEnumerator *iter = [people objectEnumerator];<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; ABPerson *person;<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; while (person = [iter nextObject]) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NSLog(@"%@ %@\n",[person valueForProperty:kABFirstNameProperty],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[person valueForProperty:kABLastNameProperty]);<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>}<br> <br>int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>// insert code here...<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; dump_ab_people();<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [pool release];<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return 0;<br>}</tt> </div></blockquote>Not as easy as Perl, but not as fugly as the CF* version.  Throw this into a "Foundation Tool", add the framework, and you're good to go.

I was thinking about turning it into a Perl XS module, and I was trying to start with what I know (C) instead of taking the risk of discovering problems with XS and Objective C.<p>

So the CoreFoundation is just a cunning plot to make Objective C seem attractive?  Got it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>

No, CoreFoundation does have its uses.  IBM's SWT is a high level abstraction of a modern GUI.  It translates to CoreFoundation on the MacOSX side and the Win32 C API on the Windows side.  But apps like that are rare.

I was looking at your very nice example, can you guide me on getting started building?<br> <br>I have followed some guidelines from the 'OS X for Unix Geeks' and ADC documentation, but without any luck.<br> <br>I am on 10.3 and I have the developer tools installed.

If you've got the developer tools installed, take a spin around<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>/Developer/Documentation</tt>.  Apple has lots of reference documentation and tutorials to get you started.  They really <i>want</i> to help you write Cocoa apps.  Most of the topics in the references contain overviews and introductions to get you started.
<p>
You may want to get a copy of one of the Cocoa programming books from O'Reilly.  I've got Simson Garfinkel's (mostly because he wrote the NeXTSTEP version, from which the O'Reilly title is derived).  I looked at the TOC for James Duncan Davidson's book, and I'd probably buy that one today if I were looking for my first book.</p>

<h2>pop3 server</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jcavanaugh/">jcavanaugh</a> on 2003-11-20T07:50:24</h3>
Is this from the ground up, or is it leveraging any of the previous perl pop3 server attempts??<br/><br/>I hope your little coding hack takes off, frankly I would love to see a basic pop3 &amp; imap server implementation in perl.  Extending a basic framework like that to create dynamic virtual folders etc, could be wicked cool.<br/><br/>--

It's from the ground up, just proving to myself that it can be done without a zillion CPAN modules.  I was excited about dynamic virtual folders, but when Casey asked me what I'd use it for, I struggled to come up with much more than "uh, turn your mail client into an RSS aggregator?".  Either I'm not thinking hard enough about what I could do with it, or I thought the idea was cooler than it actually is<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<p>

Nat, why don't you write the first practical
mod_perl 2.0 protocol module. It should be a trivial thing once you have the basic code working by itself. On my mod_perl 2.0 I keep on saying that you can now implement protocols in mod_perl, like imap, pop3, etc.  But it'd be much better if I could say. Nat implemented an imap protocol for mod_perl 2.0 in N hours, here is the URL.

<p>like <a href="http://develooper.com/code/qpsmtpd/" title="develooper.com">qpsmtpd</a develooper.com>, i think a pop3/imap server written in perl would simply be accessible for hacking and experimentation.</p>

<p> <a href="http://cvs.trainedmonkey.com/viewcvs.cgi/mandrill/" title="trainedmonkey.com">mandrill</a trainedmonkey.com> was my start at writing something like an imap server. (not really a true server, but something meant to be run using mutt's tunnel feature.)</p>

<p>but the imap spec bites. you really don't want to write an imap server.</p>
