<p>Sitting in the Red Carpet Club at Denver International Airport, listening to Sam Bush sing "Ginseng Sullivan" via grunty headphones and logged in attempting to build the new Apache before I'm r00ted.<p>

Speaking of r00ted, I'm exhausted.  We yardsaled on Saturday, swum in the neighbourhood pool, and played rugby with William.  Today we went to the opening of the Great Colorado Market (presumably it replaces the Crap Colorado Market) and walked for fucking MILES through table and trestle of crap.  The only thing I wanted, a large ugly garish watch whose face was covered by a big chrome skull, had a strap too big for me and couldn't readily be adjusted.  Probably all for the best--$10 for the ugliest thing I've ever seen and at the end of the day I'd own the ugliest thing I've ever seen and wouldn't have the $10.<p>

Flying to YAPC in about an hour.  Well, flying to St Louis where Larry, Damian, Dan, et al are going to do some real-life synchronization of where we are and where we're going, to avoid scenes like this:<p>

<blockquote>
Larry: So, the Apocalypse on objects is coming up and I thought--<br>
Dan: Objects?<br>
Larry: Yes, objects in Perl 6.<br>
Dan: Perl 6 will have objects?!<br>
Larry: Yes!<br>
Dan: FUCK!  (he writes something down)<br>
Larry: Dan, objects are just as critical as subroutines and variables.<br>
Dan: (freezes)<br>
Larry: Yes, Dan, Perl 6 will have subroutines.<br>
Dan: (winces as he writes) And variables?<br>
Larry: (sighs) Yes.  And variables.<br>
Dan: Why doesn't anyone <i>tell</i> me these things?
</blockquote>

Anyway, if Dan, Larry, et al. look stunned during YAPC, it's probably because Dan just learned that Parrot needs to support variables, or Larry just learned that "with an infinite tape, it's trivial" isn't enough of a sop to the implementors.<p>

<h2>What day is it?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-06-24T05:07:10</h3>
<p>Just had a panic attack when I read the title, because about an hour ago, I started thinking of this as YAPC, day -3.  Don't <b>do</b> that, man, you made me think I had plane tickets for the wrong day.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>(Programmers, of course, always have trouble agreeing about what point in time should be designated the epoch.)</p>
