<p>The super secret project I've been working on is the "Essential Blogging" (hopefully that's what it'll be called.  We're still arguing about that).  I have half the book already, and the rest coming very soon.  Then I plan a very public tech review.  Whee!<p>

<p>Maybe I just haven't read enough blogs (who has the time, really??), but I don't get it. They're just people's online journals, right? I could care less what most people would write. What am I missing?</p>

Nothing.  This book covers the major blogging tools, aimed at people who want to run one but don't know the best choice of software to do so.  We talk about installation and operation of Movable Type, Radio Userland, Blogger, and Blosxom.<p>

<p>Okay, I was just checking. I know that you have psosted links to them in your jounral pretty often...but maybe that's because you wee spending time looking at them as you researched the book.</p>

I do visit a bunch of blogs every day.  I learn from the things people say, and I find my daily quota of weird sites<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

I wrote about my blog visits on <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/1396" title="oreillynet.com">the O'Reilly Network</a oreillynet.com>.</p><p>

Is that list of software a complete list of what the book is aiming to cover? There are a couple more tools people might be interested in.<br> <br>For example, although it doesn't seem to be under development any more, <a href="http://www.noahgrey.com/greymatter/" title="noahgrey.com">greymatter</a noahgrey.com> seems to have a slightly freer licence than MT, for example.<br> <br>#london.pm's infobot also mentions <a href="http://slashcode.com/" title="slashcode.com">Slash</a slashcode.com> as a 'blog option', although it does note that it's probably overkill for one person at a time. It also mentions Livejournal, which doesn't allow local blogs (as far as I know) but is fairly popular.<br> <br>Of course there could be very good reason to not mention every option. Just being nosy.

It is a complete list.  We'll provide pointers to several alternatives, but the fact is that most blogs are run from Radio, Blogger, Diaryland, and Movable Type.  Blosxom is interesting because it's hackable<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

Hm<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... so all of us use Slash for our blogging, yet you don't talk about the installation and operation of Slash?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>Tell me that, at least, you talk about how wonderful Slash is and point people to the Slash book!

Yes, we will be plugging the Slash book.<p>

Hm.  If you could care less, then you do care somewhat, but you act like you don't.  I don't get it!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>Sorry, "I could care less" vs. "I couldn't care less" is one of my little pet peeves (as opposed to being one of my big pet peeves).  I am sure someone's written a blog entry about it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
