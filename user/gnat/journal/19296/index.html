<p>Arrived late at Buffalo, thanks to thunderstorms in Pittsburgh.  Went straight to the wings dinner, thanks to the driving services of O-Dogg (Jon Orwant).  Some observations:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>hot wings are bloody hot, even when they're in the mild wings' spots
<li>James Duncan (Mr Fotango) is engaged, quite possibly to a supermodel, and apparently is so disoriented by wedding plans that he thought it'd be a great idea to bring his fiance to YAPC
<li>Rocco (Mr POE) brought his whole family.  I'm trying to convince him to bring them to Portland so they can meet <i>my</i> family at long last--they've known each other through talk.bizarre since the last millennium.
<li>Chris Shiflett (Mr PHP Security) is here, thanks to the persuasive skills of Geoff Young (Mr mod_perl Security)
<li>It is rumoured that Lenzo (Mr YAPC himself) will be here this week.  Fingers crossed!

Well, yeah.  What's the point otherwise?

<p>Had to wonder that when I had "hot wings" at an "American" restaurant in Kiev.  (Last place we ate before coming home.)  They offered three alleged strengths of hotness, and we requested the highest, with a special request to the waitress to have them made as hot as they could.  She got audibly nervous and said, "Oh, no; they'd be too hot," but we insisted.  Whether or not she passed on the request is debatable, but the wings came back BLAND!  Fortunately one of my travelling companions never went anywhere without a bottle of tabasco sauce (primarily for airplane food), and we made our own hot wings.</p>

<p>Ukrainians apparently do not believe in hot food, though everything was very good, otherwise.</p>
