Isn't the difference between recognition and use vast?  I know what both your word and Elaine's mean, but I wouldn't use them in conversation.  While writing fiction I find it hard to step beyond my 800 word functional English vocabulary.  I have to consciously edit and add colourful words.<p>

I guess that's the difference between a prole and a poet--the poet can <i>use</i> the vocabulary without thinking.  It's what amazes me with James Joyce, that the words are so obviously being carefully picked and yet he writes with such fluidity that it seems like they're just coming off his tongue as he thinks them.  I'd love to be able to speak like that (well, perhaps not exactly like Finnegan's Wake<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).</p><p>

<p>I actually recognized "dassn't" from Huckleberry Finn.  I've actually used it a time or two, but when I was trying to talk colorfully rather than be understood.</p>

<p>I once had a young cousin (~13) chew me out for using big words he said he couldn't understand.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
