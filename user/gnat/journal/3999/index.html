I can't really say anything good about walmart. They are the world's biggest company. They are evil.
<p>
My uncle calls shopping at walmart on a weekend "the american experiance", packed full of rednecks and families with screaming brats<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Yeah, people from the working class are a drag!  I don't want to know they exist!</p>

<h2>Wal*Mart Shoppers</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2002-04-06T07:51:30</h3>
My theory is that they're unfortunate souls damned to wander the grand universe that is Wal*Mart.  They're all connected, you see, and that's why they're always full of the same people, no matter where you are.
<p>
I'd write a short story about it, but my name's not Jean-Paul, Albert, or Eugene, and I don't live in mid twentieth century Europe.  Ahh, the angst.</p>



<h2>Health Benefits</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/delegatrix/">delegatrix</a> on 2002-04-08T20:23:16</h3>
I'm not defending Wal-Mart, but I wondered about this one. The site says <i>"Only 38% of Wal-Mart employees have company provided health insurance--compared to a national average that shows 60% of employees are covered by company plans.</i>
<p>
Interesting.  Does this mean that only 38% take advantage of health benefits or that 38% are eligible for them?  I would imagine that many women and students who work there participate in a spouse's or parent's plan. Senior Citizens are covered by Medicare.  According to Wal-Mart stats, 14% of its workforce are seniors.
</p><p>
Actually, 70% of employees age 18 to 64 at firms with greater than 1,000 employees participated in employement-provided health insurance plans, according to the latest Census figures.
</p><p>
64% of all people were covered by some employment-based plan - their own plan or a relative's.
</p><p>
The better figure to compare against would be the average percent of employees at a firm that choose health benefits.</p>
