<p>"Programming Web Services in Perl" needs reviewers.  Unlike O'Reilly tech reviews you may have participated in in the past, this one will <i>not</i> be done once the book is fully written.  Instead, you'll get the chapters one by one as they're written by the author.  This means there's not as much time pressure (we don't need everything back in a week!) but also means that you're committing to a somewhat longer period of time.<p>

We're looking for people with experience in XML-RPC, SOAP, WSDL, etc. from Perl.  We're also looking for a few people who would be looking to buy such a book when it comes out--we want to make sure we are aiming it at the right level and covering what you want to have covered.<p>

Interested parties, enquire within: gnat AT oreilly.com.<p>

Thank you!<p>

<h2>Question</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2002-04-13T14:04:23</h3>
I'm not volunteering here, but I have a question.  If O'Reilly has a book on SOAP and a book on XML-RPC, then publishes a book that covers both topics (and then some), what will make me (as a Perl guy) want to buy either of the other books once this book comes out?

Good question.  I think the two general books are of use to people working in multiple languages, or who want to be more in-depth on the XML side of things.  The XML-RPC book covers a huge number of toolkits, from PHP to Java.  The SOAP book has examples in Java, Perl, and even one in C#.<p>

If you're a typical Perl programmer, you'd want the Perl-specific book instead of the general one.  If you bought the general one hoping you were going to learn the ins and outs of SOAP::Lite, you would be disappointed.  It's about SOAP and associated technologies, not a particular implementation of them.</p><p>

Similarly, we have Java Web Services or something like that coming out soon.</p><p>

Wow!  What a response.  Thanks for all the offers--we now have a great mix of reviewers lined up.  Stay tuned for the next book<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<p>
