<p>Wow.  "O Brother" cleaned up, one in the eye for the snobby fuckstains who run commercial country radio stations.  They refused to play the O Brother soundtrack, as they refused to play anything that wasn't a <a href="http://www.brcspirit.com/">smegrag in a big hat</a> or a <a href="http://www.faithhill.com/">anorexic painted whore</a>.  The weird thing was that <a href="">CMT</a> saw where the money was and has begun running more bluegrass.  It's not much, but it's more than the shitbags on radio do.<p>

Ahem.  Anyway, I meant to say that not only did O Brother do well, but so did <a href="http://www.alisonkrauss.com/">Alison Krauss and Union Station</a>.  And, coolest of all, Bela won two Grammies for <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A2719-2002Jan31.html">Perpetual Motion</a>, his CD of classical music.  Excellent!  (The Flash-filled Sony Classical homepage for Perpetual Motion is <a href="http://www.sonyclassical.com/music/89610/">here</a>)<p>

<h2>Faith Hill</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajtaylor/">ajtaylor</a> on 2002-03-01T01:10:59</h3>
Well, I guess we can have differing opinions about Faith. I happen to think she's a babe, but that's just my opinion.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) I liked her songs before I knew what she looked like too.
<p>
Why don't you like her?</p>

I have nothing against her (insert lewd remark here)--she was just a convenient name to use as a link for the "anorexic painted whore" line<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

<h2>And the winner is...</h2>

I generally don't really see the point to Grammy awards, especially now that there are so many damned categories.  Also, too much weird and undeserved crap happens like albums being nominated that were released a year earlier and certain artists (cough...Sting...cough) winning a Grammy for very mediocre songs.
<p>
"And the winner for Best New Latin Polka Duo or Band is..."</p>



<h2>Awards</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-03-01T16:22:54</h3>
Televised awards shows all suck.  They are nothing but a giant circle jerk, if I may be a bit graphic.  That said, they might as well suck as a force for good instead of evil, giving awards for O Brother, They Might Be Giants, Bob Dylan, Sade, and other reasonably good acts that I have exercised my good judgment in investing in over the years; and I now stand vindicated in my purchases.  Or not.  The awards are still utterly meaningless as a measure of real value, but again, better good music than bad music.  Of course, most of the awards still went to bad music.<br> <br>Speaking of CMT, I think they are the ones who actually had a Bluegrass Week or something and showed the O Brother soundtrack documentary.<br>
