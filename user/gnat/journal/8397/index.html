<p>I just got a six DVD set of the WWDC 2002 presentations from Apple.  I have the sessions playing in the background, and I'm tuning in when I hear something interesting.  This is just like being at a real conference, except that listening to one session doesn't preclude listening to another, and the real world still lacks rewind despite my repeated feature requests.<p>

Whee!<p>

Is this the next step for TPC/YAPC?<br>

I've been thinking about it, but their production values are much higher than mine!  They pay to have cameras with tripods, and edit in the slides.  I'd like to do that, but I never have time.<p>

One thing I want to do, though, is make VCDs of some TPC and OSXCON sessions to send around to Perl Monger groups.  ENOTUITS.</p><p>

It would be nice to have such VCDs on the web. <br> <br>I'd really like to go to some of these conferences, but besides the usual costs, I still have to pay for a ticket from Brazil to . <br> <br>And our money has lost a lot of its value when compared to dollar or euro lately. It's simply impossible for me to go somewhere out of<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.BR now... <br> <br>Such VCDs would bring the conference at my office and it would be very good to be able to understand some jokes<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) (of course, learning is the objective, but the jokes must be nice too)

<h2>ADC TV</h2>

I've been trying to listen to or watch these on Apple Developer Connection TV for weeks now, and never have any success. This is a real shame, as MSDN TV is almost always available and has plenty of bandwidth (if that's the issue).<br> <br>If you've got contacts at apple for this, please prod them<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
