<p>MOVIE!  Finished the script, started shooting.  It's amazingly hard to make a movie fail to suck, which is why the movie will suck.  My able crew are not SAG-certified, so there were tricky union issues to negotiate.<p>

Began shooting around 10am, finished around 1.  Dan and Schwern were standouts in how well they sold it.  Schwern improved a lot, and I made the mistake of filming his scene in a stairwell.  *Two* floors got to hear him bellow "FUCK THE FARMERS!  FUCK THEM UP THE ASS!".  After I yelled "cut", two students walked across the upper floor and cast us a disapproving glance.  I said "I'm sorry!" and one said "That's okay" with a very fake smile that became a glower as she turned back to her friend.  I wish I'd had the camera on that!<p>

I'm borrowing Meng's iBook (Jarkko needed his.  Something to do with Perl 5.8, the wastrel) and editing the movie this afternoon.  If I can do it, it'll rock.  If I can't, I'll be a miserable failure of a human being.<p>

I was scheduled to give a talk today, "Something Something" but Robert Spier kindly filled in for me with a 45m version of his 3 hour Optimization tutorial.  He did swear in a Kiwi accent, though, to maintain the illusion that he was me.<p>

I'm rather disturbed by the way that everyone seems to think that I can be perfectly characterized by swearing in a Kiwi accent.  This movie, unfortunately, will not change their impression.<p>

More after the movie--this evening is a "Whose Code is it Anyway?" rehearsal, then off to Brent's for a bbq.  I have nothing to do on Friday, praise Allah, so I can fuck around like a regular attendee again.  And record video and audio.<p>

when/where will the movie be showing? Or is this a YAPC secret?
