<h1>Hello from DefCon</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/gnat/">gnat</a> on 2003-08-01T01:36:21</h2>
</div> <!-- /span4 -->


<div class="span8">
<p>I'm in the lobby/bar area of <a href="http://www.defcon.org/">DEFCON</a>, a big ole security/hacker/cracker/white hat-black-hat type conference.  Black t-shirts, goatees, pony tails, as far as the eye can see.  I am already regretting packing only white t-shirts.  I stopped off to have my hair cut on the way here--perhaps I should have had it shaved.<p>

I'm feeling quite the fish out of water.  It's weird to be at a conference and not know everyone--a sign, I suspect, that I've attended too few Perl conferences and spent too little time with the rest of the world's population.  I'd like to meet people to go to dinner with, but I have no idea how to do it aside from walking up to random people and saying "hi, you don't know me, but I'd like to have dinner with you" which sounds a lot like a come on :-)  I wonder whether a designated "hang around here before you go to dinner to meet other people who also want to eat" type place would help that (file that idea away for OSCON next year).  God knows I could do with it right now.<p>

They have a wireless network, which hasn't crashed yet.  Their web site is cool--someone's running a web bbs on which people can hook up, discuss events, and so on.  That's a nifty idea.  And there are "radio stations".  There's one on an FM band, but I'm not sure how I'm supposed to access the radio station on "34".  I'll sort it out tomorrow, I'm sure, when my friends who <i>have</i> been here before start to arrive.<p>

Oh well, time to strike out and attempt to Make A New Friend for dinner.  Wish me luck!  (My boss has already noted that bail is not reimbursable)<p>

I've noted that most non-TV jobs have this requirement.

<p>but not to yapc? Sad, especially when DEFCON is mostly lame anymore. Look around for Wozz and the r00t crowd. Very good, very bright guys.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Tell Wozz[Matt] I said hi if you bump into him.....</p>

I'm the security editor, I'm not the Perl editor.  Hence DefCon, not YAPC::Europe.  I'll look for Wozz, but as nobody has nametags, it'll be rather difficult<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

(DefCon's now mostly lame in the same way that Burning Man is now mostly lame--if you were around in the old days then it's a pale shadow of its former self, but if you're new to it then it's still as impressive as all hell)</p>

<p>He's one of the amply-sized bald guys..:D  <a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0001019/images/pictures/2002/07/26/wozzhead.jpg" title="salon.com">is probably close to what he looks like these days</a salon.com> and still a lot like <a href="http://www.suck-my-big.org/kansas/wozz-sight.jpg" title="suck-my-big.org">he used to look</a suck-my-big.org> years ago. He's a fun guy and he usually goes every year.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

If it makes you feel any better, you made the<br>trip for me. I'd have bought you dinner.<br>Next time I'll wear a Republic of<br>Perl shirt instead of the Amiga Deathbed Vigil<br>or NetBSD World Tour.<br> <br>I've brought friends in previous years. Always<br>the same, they leave their laptop at home the<br>first year and bring it the next. I spent most<br>of the the trip in front of mine with the headphones<br>on. Working on typesafety.pm. The new version will<br>suck much less, I promise. Of course, anything<br>I write succumbs to Xeno's suck paradox - it<br>always sucks much less than the previous version<br>but never stops sucking entirely.<br> <br>Sitting at my card table in the corner at home,<br>the bizarre and interesting are kept far, far<br>away, which is good for writing code. DEFCON<br>is my heeded siren call, where once a year I<br>flirt with human interaction, the law,<br>alcohol, and other things with which I share<br>a love-hate relationship.<br> <br>Going to YAPC, I'd resolve to make plans which<br>I'm too busy to do, meet people which would<br>cause thoughts to bubble up which would only<br>cause me grief, and I'd make all sorts of<br>enemies that I don't want. I'd feel so small.<br>And people like you wouldn't sit down and<br>gab with me.<br> <br>Cheers,<br>-scott
