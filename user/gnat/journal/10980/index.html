<p>It was fun.  Got to see my friends, had a tour of Weta, and enjoyed a brief respite from the unceasing rain that is driving Jenine and the kids mad.<p>

Today I edited and answered email.  Tomorrow: more of the same.  I had an interesting proposal for a book, but when I read the sample chapters I could tell that the authors were going for a much more boring and tedious approach, and that it was the part that I found boring and tedious that they loved and wanted to base the book around.  Ixnay on the ookbay.<p>

lwall++ for getting the Apocalypse out.  It was a real tough one, though hopefully we're nearing the end of the tough ones.  As Ali G would say, "respec'".  I met a friend whose baby girl had sat through a lot of Ali G episodes, and thus gone through a phase where she said "respec'" instead of "thanks".<p>

Trying to decide whether to take on a Microsoft topic.  And not just a kinda-MS kinda-open source topic, but a fully-fledged EVIL MICROSOFT topic.  For a book I'd edit, you see.  It might make a lot of money ....   So the movement to the dark side begins.<p>

Have realized the hard way that putting out cameras on tables at a wedding is an expensive way to get hundreds of really bad photos.  Disposable cameras suck, and drunk amateurs with disposable cameras produce nigh-maximal suckage.  There was one roll, however, obviously taken by someone with an eye for photography: nice composition, well timed, all lit well.  If you find yourself at a wedding with such a camera, I have some advice: try to take photos of things that everyone else <i>isn't</i>--namely, the cousins who are getting on really well, the bride as she gets a drink from teh bar, someone mid-laugh.  Don't waste your time taking photos of the entrance of the bride and groom--the wedding couple will already have about a hundred of that to choose from.<p>

Must go to sleep: nearly 2am here, and I'll have to be up at 7 with the kids.  Night!<p>

I hope you fine ORA folk are planning on turning around a book containing the Apocalypses and Exegeses once the spec is finalized.... when Perl 6 Alpha comes out, I'd much rather be reading an Introducing Perl 6 volume than thumbing through a ream of printouts.</p>

Yup, we're waiting for the sounds of hammering and knocking inside No. 6, Perl Way, to settle down before we publish any Perl 6 books.  It seems premature to publish before there's an implementation<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  But once there's a there there, you can bet your bootie we'll be all over it like<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... like<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... like a great great simile for coverage.<p>

That imagery of a house being built is wonderful... I can see Damian standing over there with Larry arguing which way to hold the blueprint (-- "We need more swimming pools!  -- No, we need smaller swimmers!"), Dan waiting with a pile of two-by-fours in his shoulder muttering about the fastest two-by-fours you've ever seen...<br>

How odd, that the Apocalypses so far have followed the outline of Camel 3.  *humming conspiratorially*

Ergh, <code>P5rl</code>?  You've gotta quit taking advice from Slashdot comments.
