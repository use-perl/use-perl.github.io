<p>As some of you know, Brian Foy is on active duty in Iraq.  Apparently the heat of the desert is such that the glue in the spines of books melts and the books disintegrate after a single read.  So I ran around the house looking for all the books I'd read and wasn't planning on reading again, and sent them to him.  Then I went to a couple of local secondhand bookstores and gave them boxes to keep books in that people had tried to trade in but which the bookstores didn't want.<p>

Today I sent my first box of books.  I tried to stick to mystery, adventure, action, thriller type books, avoiding bodice rippers and essays on peace :-)  I think I can do a box a week--it was $20 shipping, $3 for the box, $3 for "insurance" (return receipt).<p>

I'd send him O'Reilly freebies, but something tells me that it'd be cruel and unusual punishment to send him copies of "Practical RDF" and "C# Essentials" :-)<p>
