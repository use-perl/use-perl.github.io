<p>The flight was a dream--the kids were good, and we made all our connections.  There was some drama in Denver when our flight was hideously overbooked and was late in departing, but we ran in Los Angeles and caught the flight to Auckland without a problem.<p>

Dad was waiting for us at the airport with a rented minivan.  We drove to Warkworth and stopped for a steak and cheese pie.  Then we went home to change, and immediately went out on the boat to fish.  The weather was wet and windy, but it was still fun.  William caught four fish, and the rest of us caught nothing.<p>

Dinner was fish and chips--glorious!  The best melt-in-your-mouth fish you'll ever eat, and all the family gathered around the newsprint on the living room floor.  It's good to be back.<p>
