<p>Flu sucks.  I never knew my stomach could contain so much.  On the plus side, two days of not eating has helped me regain control of my eating.<P><br/><br/>Beta of the new Opera is out.  I don't like the bookmark code <I>at all</I>.  Ugly navigation system.  The screen only shows the current bookmark folder, names of contained folders, and an up link.  There's no hierarchical view.  Bah, humbug.<P><br/><br/>We got back from California to find out that Jenine's grandmother had died, so the women are heading back for the funeral.  William and I are staying here, as William's no longer travelling well.  He didn't like being in California at all.  So we're going to bond, and I'll teach him all the things Jenine won't let me: how to drink port, how to chat up hookers, etc.<P><br/><br/>So much email accumulated while I was out, I'm only just getting to the end of it.  And then there's the work I was suppposed to have done, and the work I'm supposed to be doing now.  Ugh.  I need a clone.<P><br/><br/>My colocate box died, so I'm installing everything onto a new machine.  What a pain in the ass that is.  I am reminded how much I hate system administration.  Too much waiting for things to fail to compile, and not enough instant gratification for my liking.<P><br/><br/>Speaking of instant gratification ... someone must have used rendering software to create Toy Story-like porn.  That is, rendered characters rutting.  Any of my intrepid readers have links to such things?  I was watching Shrek fo r the 15th time yesterday (William likes it.  A lot) and got to thinking ...<P><br/><br/><I>--Nat</I></p>
