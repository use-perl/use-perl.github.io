<p>Saw <a href="http://www.costik.com/gamespek.html">this article</a> today, on the language of computer games.  Loved it.  It occurs to me that we're just seeing the start of recent video game culture entering popular culture--XXX had Vin Diesel explaining away his ability to shoot as "I broke my leg and spent three months playing first person shooters".  The first screenplay that makes a handful of these terms cool is going to make a lot of money.<p>

How is that?  I can certainly see how the first screenplay that uses these terms and makes a lot of money would make the terms cool.  I don't see how it would work the other way.

Yeah, it's hard to tease the two apart.  I guess the key is that the movie be well made--a good movie should make money, whether it uses slang or not.  I was trying to give myself an escape hatch should a really bad movie use the slang--think of all the technobabble in movies.  Slang can be done well and it can be done poorly, and I was trying to get across was that slang alone isn't enough.<p>
