<p><a href="http://raelity.org/">Rael</a> and I are in London, schmoozing on O'Reilly's behalf.  Schmoozing whom? you ask.  We had dinner last night with the <a href="http://www.fotango.com/">Fotango</a> folks (Arthur, Malin, James, Katrien, Simon) and <a href="http://www.fsck.com/">Jesse</a>.  This morning we had breakfast with Dan Hill from the BBC, and tonight we're seeing some more of the BBC folks.<p>

In between meetings there's been a bit of tourism--we wandered through Rael's old haunts in Kensington, sprinted around the Royal Albert Hall trying to find a place to pee that wouldn't result in a conviction for public urination, and just today went to see Westminster Abbey.  Yes, I got to stand on the graves of many now-unknown once-famous people, and even stood on the stone of Joseph Addison ("who?"  "he started the Tatler with Steele!  He began the golden age of literary magazines!"  "whatEVAH").  I love history, you get to stand on so many dead people.<p>

Wifi in Starbucks is great, and free for we Americans.  The poor Brits pay through the nose for everything, including wifi.  We get all-you-can-eat for a flat monthly fee.  Brits are taxed every time they blink.  Who in their right mind would want to read a spam-filled mailbox from Starbucks when they're being billed in quarter-hour increments?<p>

All this is a prelude to <a href="http://wiki.oreillynet.com/eurofoo/">Euro Foo Camp</a>.  Wednesday we fly to Amsterdam, Thursday we take the train up to Enschede.  I'm looking forward to meeting dozens of European hackers I wouldn't otherwise have an opportunity to get to know.  Until then, farewell.  Or, as they say here, "ahfuckoffoutofityagit!"<p>

Somehow you've just managed to miss all of the emergency london.pm meetings that are currently going on. There was one on Saturday and the next one is on Wednesday. Of course, if we'd known that you were around we could have arranged another one<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>Places to Pee</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/2shortplanks/">2shortplanks</a> on 2004-08-16T14:37:57</h3>
If you're ever in that situation again, then you can always pop into the Science Museum on Exhibition Road.  Not only is it free (and has toilets) but you can go gawp at the computer stuff in there which is very cool.
<p>
Or you can sneak into the student union bar (north hand side of the road south of the Albert Hall, to the west) and visit the bar as well.
</p><p>
Both excellent Locations.  Now if only someone would organise a Perl Conf in either places<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>

What kind of a fool would ever organise a Perl conference?

Errr.

Working on it.
