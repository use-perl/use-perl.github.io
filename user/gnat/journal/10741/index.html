<p>My sister's wedding went off well on Saturday.  His family flew over from Colorado, and a lot of our family and friends showed up.  Bree was married under the tree that the first Torkington in New Zealand camped under when he first arrived, and I used that fact in the ceremony.  Yes, I was the "celebrant", the faux-minister (I prefer the term "defrocked") who lead them through the exchange and the vows and the kissing and the hey hey hey.<p>

And then afterward, the photographer asked whether I was interested in doing more weddings.  Apparently there's a shortage of male celebrants around, particularly ones who can do a humorous ceremony.  I'd made the ceremony lighthearted at Bree's request ("so by the power vested in me by a healthy disrespect for organized religion, I pronounce you husband and wife") and it seems she's not the only one who doesn't want a big long serious staid wedding.<p>

So, my new career would appear to be underway.  <a href="http://www.fathertedonline.ukf.net/">Father Torkington</a> is in da house and open for business ...<p>

<h2>BYOB Wedding</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2003-02-23T04:36:43</h3>
<p>As a licensed minister (who doesn't believe in God, I might add), I've had the pleasure of performing two weddings.  At the first one, I presided over wedding of my best friend on my birthday, which was pretty cool.  I also wrangled a date out of it, though to this day I'm not quite certain how that happened.</p>

<p>The second wedding, I kid you not, was a BYOB (Bring Your Own Beer) wedding.  It was a costume wedding held right before Halloween and afterwards I was standing on the porch chatting with a friend when an angel with bent wings and a cigarette dangling from her lips stormed out of the house cussing up a storm.  Though I am by no means a religious man, I felt I should play the part and I asked why she was so upset on such a happy day.</p>

<p>"Because my sister married an blankety blank blank" (yes, I'm paraphrasing to protect the kiddie's ears.)</p>

<p>In any event, congratulations on performing a wedding and all the best to your sister.</p>

You led them through the "hey hey hey"?<br> </p><p>Las Vegas weddings seem rather tame, by comparison.<br> </p><p>Btw, what's it like being defrocked?  Does it hurt?</p>

<p>Just read your entry to my wife. She wants to know if you were really naked when you performed the ceremony.</p>

I like your wife's imagination.  Fortunately for all concerned, I was clothed.  I was, however, not wearing a frock.<p>
