<p>I'm really impressed with <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Ovid/journal/7847">Ovid's testing experiences</a>.  I think there's an interesting psychological phenomenon related to testing and exercise and all those Good Things. When I do them, I know they're good.  But they just aren't what I find fun, so I don't do them as often as I should.  There's a difference between the "feels good when I stop" and the "feels good when I do" that means I get addicted to coding but not to exercise or testing or vegetables.<p>

<h2>testng, testing</h2>

Ditto on originally not wanting to write tests. The day job still is a situation difficult to unit test, mostly because the code's grown over the past 5 years to such an extent as to be almost unrecognizable.<br> <br>However, outside of this, I use Test::Simple <i>lots</i> and am very, very happy with it. It turns the process into just another simple-to-do operation. And it caught a bug in GraphViz::Data:Structure that I still don't know how to fix yet, but at least I know it exists!



<h2>Testing paradox</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2002-09-20T18:37:14</h3>
<p>I have this weird problem that I am addicted to experiencing new things (whether programming related or otherwise), but at the same time I am resistant to change.  I was always curious about testing, but I didn't want to change my routine at work, even though I knew it was necessary.  Now that I've gotten over the hump, I'm addicted.</p>

<p>Testing seems like grunt work to many programmers, but what has really sold me is the problem I <em>used</em> to have:  whenever I would make large-scale changes to a system, I would have this irritable feeling in the pit of my stomach that kept letting me know that I must have missed something.  Now that I write the tests first, I know for a fact that I've missed something, but that's because my test has caught it and not an angry call from a customer at two in the morning.  Testing just makes me feel like more of a man<nobr> <wbr></nobr><strong>:)</strong> </p>
