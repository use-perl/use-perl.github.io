<h1>Writing a DBD Module</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>So I see a growing number of DBD modules that let you treat some data source (Excel, CSV, Google) as a  database to be queried with SQL.  Obviously things like joins won't make sense for every data source, but it's an intriguing idea.<p>

Are there any existing docs on how to write a DBD module, using SQL::Statement?  Or has everyone who's done it had to learn the ropes from scratch?  <p>

<p>The canonical documentation for DBD writers is <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/TIMB/DBI-1.35/lib/DBI/DBD.pm" title="cpan.org">DBI::DBD</a cpan.org>.</p>

<h2>My experiences writing DBD::google</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dlc/">dlc</a> on 2003-03-24T15:28:11</h3>
<p>When I started writing <code>DBD::google</code>, there was only one thing to go by: <code>DBI::DBD</code>, which gives a basic but
servicable intro to writing a DBD.  Since then,
 Takanori Kawai released <code>DBD::Template</code>, which provides a pretty good starting point, mostly (it seems) encapsulating the good advice from <code>DBI::DBD</code>.</p>

<p>As far as <code>SQL::Statement</code> goes, I initially wrote <code>DBD::google</code> without it, but am rewriting it to subclass <code>SQL::Parser</code> and implement it's own feature set, which (SELECT-wise) is a superset of ANSI SQL, but in all other ways is extremely limited.  Jeff Zucker (the <code>SQL::Statement</code> maintainer) tells me that the upcoming <code>SQL::Statement</code> version 1.006 will be even more amenable to subclassing that 1.005 is.</p>

For a secret project I worked on (which will eventually may DBD::Something) it was easier to write a new regex based SQL-like parser.  SQL::Statement (a few months ago) was too strict, and didn't allow me to bend the rules.

<p>Take a look at <code>SQL::Translator</code> (on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/kclark/SQL-Translator/" title="cpan.org">CPAN</a cpan.org>, also at <a href="http://sf.net/projects/sqlfairy/" title="sf.net">http://sf.net/projects/sqlfairy/</a sf.net>),
which is a set of modules designed to translate the
CREATE syntax of one DB into another.  Many of the parsers we currently have (MySQL, Sybase, Pg, Oracle) are based on Parse::RecDescent.</p>

It's not <i>exactly</i> what you mean, but Damian uses Parse::RecDescent to go the other way, turning English questions into valid SQL statements. If it's possible to go that way, surely parsing the much-more-regular-than-English SQL variant of any particular database has to be feasible.

<p>Random thought: would it make any sense to skip ahead a bit by poking around in the source of open source databases like MySQL &amp; PostgreSQL and using their SQL parsing code as the basis for a general purpose SQL interpreter? Or would that be more trouble than it's worth? I suppose it depends on what you're trying to accomplish...</p>

<p>The <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/kclark/SQL-Translator" title="cpan.org">SQL::Translator</a cpan.org>
folks have discussed (OK, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=4090262" title="sourceforge.net">I brought it up</a sourceforge.net>) using the provided yacc grammars as the basis for the MySQL and Pg parsers, although none of us has done anything with it yet.</p>

<p>I had a conversation about this very topic with Jeff Zucker a few weeks ago, because I had the same issues with <code>SQL::Statement</code>.  He pointed me at <code>SQL::Parser</code>, upon which <code>SQL::Statement</code> is based, and which is much more flexible.  You simply need to subclass <code>SQL::Parser</code>, and override the methods that aren't flexible enough for you.</p>

<p>Also, the guts of <code>SQL::Parser</code> are regex-based, and Jeff seems pretty open to accepting ideas and patches, so you might want to talk to him about contributing your improvements / modifications.</p>
