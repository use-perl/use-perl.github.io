<p>QC1 of the SOAP book.  QC1 is where the book has been copyedited, and we get to read through and find mistakes introduced or overlooked by the copyeditor and conversion process.  This is expected to take today and perhaps part of tonight as well.<P><br/><br/>It would only have taken me today, but it was 11:30 before I got productive.  Jenine was exhausted after the trip home from the funeral and I took the kids to let her sleep in.  It's bloody hard to work with one on your lap and the other watching "Between the Lions" in front of you :-)<P><br/><br/>Today's a black day (as <A HREF="http://use.perl.org/user/matts/">Matt</A> put it) for me.  Grouchy and snippy.  Probably lack of sleep and too much caffeine (three cans of Coke in an hour, trying to wake up).<P><br/><br/>I had an idea reading the advocacy list.  Some kind of collaborative training project.  You go to the site and take a test.  Each question has a bit of Perl code and you have to fix it.  You get automatically graded on style and correctness.  There are pointers to explanations of the concept behind each question ("if you have an array ref, you have to say <TT>push @$foo, $bar</TT> not <TT>push $foo, $bar</TT>").  In the end this might even act as a kind of certification--if you can complete 50 questions, you know enough to be hired.<P><br/><br/><I>--Nat</I></p>
