I boycotted that film.  The premise is so fundamentally flawed that it is an insult.

I think I'm going to be amused if I ever read that PHP book.
<br>
<br>Just the way that it will presumably appear positive about a language of which you evidently don't really approve. =)

To be honest, I have mixed feelings about PHP.  I now have it installed on all my machines, and for most of my small web programs I think I'd use it instead of CGI.<p>

But it's far from perfect.  It's struggling with backwards compatibility--the very things that make it easy to use also make it easy to have security holes, make it difficult to build large maintainable websites, and don't scale as more things get added to the language.</p><p>

The book doesn't rah-rah PHP, it just says how best to use it.  I'm confident it'll be a good book (I wasn't so confident with my last book!) and I <i>know</i> it'll wipe the floor with the other PHP books that are out there.  And ultimately, that's what it's all about<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>
