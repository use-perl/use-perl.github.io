<p>Now I've given you all suggestions for talks at OSCON, I'd like you to return the favour.  I'd like to go to <a href="http://www.yapc.org/Europe/2003/cfp.en.html#papers">YAPC::Europe</a> this year, as I haven't been since London.  (And Jenine will kill me if I don't take her to Paris).  Should I speak?  If so, what would you like me to speak on?  I know a lot about YAS, OSCON, O'Reilly, editing, and so on.  I will have put the Perl Cookbook to bed by that stage.  The one thing I don't want to speak about is the technical stuff in Perl 6--Damian, Larry, Allison, Dan, and others are the definitive sources there.  I'm happy to talk about why <i>managing</i> Perl 6 is slightly preferable to slitting one's wrists with a ricin-drenched buzzsaw, however.  Help!<p>

I don't know how this would work, but perhaps something that addressed writing in general, perhaps editor-author interactions and how to make them better.  things like how to keep your editor happy (besides sending him DVDs<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) what to expect in terms of editor help, what parts of the contract you should worry about (with IANAL caveats, of course).  writing is hard work, and you've been on both sides so you're in a unique position to be able to help future authors understand the process and make it run more smoothly.

That's a good idea--I'll have to banish any other O'Reillyites from the room before I start spilling our secrets though<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

  No! If people knew the truth about writing they would never do it and we wouldn't have as many great books<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
</p>

<p>
  Seriously though, I think that working on Cookbook 2e must be an interesting adventure. Is there anything that you could say about the evolution of Perl between 1e and 2e? Any general trends that would illuminate us on our own actions?

<p>
  Other (random) thought: "How the Mighty Have Fallen: A Tale of Woe and Wonder" about cool OS X stuff one can do in Perl.

  I look forward to seeing you in Paris<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>What we really want</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grinder/">grinder</a> on 2003-02-11T16:36:58</h3>
<p>...would be a roadmap on how Perl 6 will recontextualize open-source applications by
benchmarking visionary infrastructures that innovate leading-edge software technologies
and transform strategic innovations through static source code analysis into revolutionary
interactive  methodologies for synthesizing e-business architectures...</p>

<p>Nah, fsck that, what we really want is a Rant&trade;</p>

No wait, I like that first idea.  Hmmm<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I could do something with that.  Put Perl 6 in its proper historical, sociological, scientific, and philosophical context.  Maybe with some photos from the tour we took of the Paris sewers on our last trip<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

<h2>Oh, go ahead...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Elian/">Elian</a> on 2003-02-12T17:11:50</h3>
Talk about the technical stuff. This is your golden opportunity--since Damian, Larry, and I are really unlikely to be there, this is your big chance to get all those features you wanted into Perl 6, while at the same time convincing the audience that we really are using INTERCAL as our primary development language...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>Be there</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2003-02-14T21:15:05</h3>
<p>Just make sure that it's less Disneyesque than your talk at YAPC::NA 2002.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:P</p>
