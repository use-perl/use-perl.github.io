<p>This year we decided to get each other just the one present, because cash is so tight.  And, sure enough, UPS has stranded in Memphis TN the present Jenine bought for me, undeliverable until at least the 27th.  Note to self: use FedEx.<P><br/><br/>It was, I believe, a DVD player.  Perhaps I shouldn't have bought Jenine "Castaway" on DVD, and William "Sleeping Beauty" on DVD.  D'oh.<P><br/><br/>On the upside, William woke up before me this morning and I heard his soft little voice say "I love you, Daddy" out of the blue.  Not even delayed DVD players can ruin a day that starts like that.<P><br/><br/><I>--Nat</I></p>

I was playing with my daughter this morning.  I'd press down, she'd push up against my fingers.

It's when she taps out a sequence of primes that you worry<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

Actually, it gets better.  William spent the last two months of pregnancy with his feet wedged up underneath Jenine's ribs, pushing pushing pushing.  Jenine would put the heel of her hand against his feet and push back hard to make him move.  Hmm, perhaps not "better".</p><p>

Be sure to sing to her--she can hear you and many folks report infants responding differently (positively) to songs they heard from inside the womb.  William loves the banjo now, and sat rapt through all of "O Brother Where Art Thou", but I don't know whether that's pre-birth or post-birth exposure.</p><p>

Merry Christmas<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... <b>Dad</b>.</p><p>
