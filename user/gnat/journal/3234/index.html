<p>Actually, what's in my web browser.<p>

<a href="http://www.eblong.com/zarf/osx-log.html">My Very Secret Mac OS X Diary</a>.  The author is a big name in the interactive fiction (text adventure) world, and funny.  This is his bitchy diary about his first weeks with OS X.  He appears to be like Pudge--a pissy whining Mac OS 9 user :-)<p>

<a href="http://www.macslash.com/article.pl?sid=02/02/28/189213&mode=thread">MacSlash thread on how you came to be using OS X</a>.  I'm amazed at the diversity.  And jealous.  Still, my IBM laptop's fan and hard drive are making noises, so perhaps it'll die soon and I can have an iBook as a replacement!<p>

<a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">Safari</a>.  I used to mock the idea of online books, but I'm a convert.  The Safari interface isn't as easy to use as it could be, but it's not so complex that you can't find what you want.  It also beats the hell out of lugging two suitcases of books with me to New Zealand!  I'm reading Unix Power Tools to try and work out what makes the book format tick.<p>

<h3><a href="/user/gnat/">gnat</a> on 2002-03-01T23:57:37</h3>
Not that Unix Power Tools is on Safari, dammit.  Oh sure, every Perl book under the sun, but not the bloody book <i>I</i> want!<p>

It's a conspiracy!</p><p>

And note that I'm the one who posted that Diary on Slashdot<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... maybe I have a secret agenda?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D

<em>(Installer did not refer to "disk 1", "disk 2", etc. Instead, said "Insert CD that looks like this:" and showed picture of CD label, which showed figure juggling one CD, or two CDs, etc. Do they really believe that installation procedure is thereby made accessible to illiterates? Ha ha. Stupid Steve.)</em>
<p>
I don't know if Steve Jobs was really so involved in the process that blaming him is fair -- I try to filter Mac-anything out of what I read -- but it's new to read someone using an OS that isn't Windows bitching about the "evil head guy".<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
