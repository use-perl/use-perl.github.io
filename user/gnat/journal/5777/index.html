<p>Jenine returned from shopping yesterday with the Season 2 Buffy DVD collection.  Happy me!<p>

Speaking of movies, I can bring "Meet the Feebles" to YAPC if anyone wants to watch it during the conference.<p>

<h2>Old seasons</h2>

I don't get the logic behind the DVD releases of Buffy. If I understand correctly, only the first two seasons are available in zone 1 ? The first four have been released in zone 2. (My primary motivation for getting a DVD player was to be able to watch Buffy <i>in English</i>.)

<p>Why do US releases lag so far behind? Over here we've already got Buffy series 1-4 and Angel series 1 and 2 on DVD. And the first half of series 6 of Buffy and series 3 of Angel were both released on VHS on Monday. See <a href="http://www.blackstar.co.uk/zone/buffy" title="blackstar.co.uk">Blackstar's Buffy Zone</a blackstar.co.uk> for details.</p>

<p>Syndication. You can currently see re-runs of Season 3 of Buffy on some cable chanel.Their contract probably prevents the release of VHS/DVDs until the end of the season.</p>
<p>I should know, I did not buy season 3 and 4 before flying to the US for the summer<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;--(</p>

<p>Those kind of contracts must be very different over here then. Currently we have BBC showing series 2 of Buffy, Sky showing series 3 of Buffy and Channel 4 running the first terrestrial showing of Angel series 2.</p>
<p>In the UK (as demonstrated with Angel series 2) it's very common for DVDs to be released <i>before</i> it's been shown on terrestrial TV.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's even more extreme. I noticed a DVD of the first two episodes of series 9 of the X-Files in the shops over the weekend. That doesn't start showing in the UK on <i>any</i> channel until this coming Thursday.</p>

<h2>Bring the Feebles!</h2>

If for no other reason than to let people know what they're getting into when they work for/with you...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-P

I haven't seen that nor "Braindead". Of course I got a kick out of "Meet the Feebles". Nothing quite like muppet pr0n. At least that's how I describe it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
