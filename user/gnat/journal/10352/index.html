<p>This weekend saw two cultural breakthroughs for me.  I saw "Bridget Jones's Diary", and loved it.  If there's an award for most use of the word "fuck" in a romantic comedy, that movie must surely win.  Even over "Four Weddings and a Funeral".<p>

The second breakthrough was musical.  I've got most of a bluegrass solo to Bryan Adams's "Heaven" worked up.  If there's an award for most ridiculous waste of musical time and effort, I feel I am among the finalists.<p>

Please tell me there's going to be room for singers at the YAPC and TPC jam bofs. Or am I going to have to <em>learn</em> some tunes on the flute?

If you distribute the chords to "Knees Up, Mother Brown" beforehand, I'm sure we can make room for you<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

Personally, I thought the book was a lot better than the film, even if it
is a blatant rip off (though maybe 'homage' would be a more appropriate
term) of Pride &amp; Prejudice

I got about 1/3 through the book but had to stop reading it because I found myself needing to go puke too many times.
<p>
This is one case where I think the movie was better than the book, especially considering the material it had to start with.</p>

I never read the book for the same reason I never watched the movie--it sounded like it'd be weak crap that I could only appreciate if I were a single woman with the same mindset as BrJo.  The movie definitely wasn't like that--the story is about her getting strength, not about her whining and drinking about how single she is.<p>
