<p>Happy me!  The loaner iBook from Apple arrived today (apparently I'll be editing Mac books soon) and I've been getting up to speed with it.  Sexy, so sexy.  Tiny 12" screen.  I'd forgotten how small 12" is, he says bragging.<p>

I've been installing software.  It comes with emacs, but not a GUI emacs.  I downloaded a build of emacs for OS X, but it wouldn't run the precompiled VM elc files that work on the standard emacs.  I'm running emacs from a terminal window now while I find time to debug further.<p>

For irc and AIM I'm using <a href="http://www.epicware.com/fire.html">Fire</a>.  It took a little while to work out its model, but it's great.  AIM and irc in the one program.  Slurp.  I avoided Ircle because it takes $$$ and I'm not used to this brave new world of paying for software.<p>

Adjusted the keyboard repeat speed to fast with little delay.  Figured out what the different power cables are for, thanks to #perl, and got the battery charged.  Spent a fun few hours in my easy chair, working.<p>

Grabbed <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kedoin/VNC/VNCViewer/">VNCViewer built for OS X</a> and installed that.  Used it to control my Windoze box while I was upstairs.  Enabled 'remote logins' on the System Preference, aka sshd.  Then scp-ed mailboxes from machine to machine.<p>

Pudge is sending me the DV files of my YAPC movie so I can continue editing.  There are pauses I want to remove, titles to add, and so on.  Meanwhile, Joe Johnston has created <a href="http://www.perl.org/yapc/2002/audio/">a techno remix</a> of YAPC that's a ton of fun.  Someone take Cakewalk Pro away from him before he remixes again!<p>

<h2>Emacs</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Theory/">Theory</a> on 2002-07-10T22:46:35</h3>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://mac-emacs.sourceforge.net/" title="sourceforge.net">Mac-Emacs</a sourceforge.net> project. You'll find instructions there. But the upshot is that you can pretty much check out GNU Emacs from CVS and compile it, and it'll work beautifully with the Aqua interface. I spend virtually all my time there.</p>



<h2>Don't Spielberg it</h2>

If you've seen the latest South Park. &nbsp;:-)



<h2>Enjoy</h2>

<p>With Cakewalk, I can finally give something back to Perl for all the hours I've spent looking for stupid syntax errors. &nbsp;:-)</p>



<h2>editor</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/wickline/">wickline</a> on 2002-07-11T10:11:31</h3>
<tt>you might also want to try BBEdit<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; http://barebones.com/<br> <br>That editor is the primary reason I use the mac, and the reason<br>I had my employer buy me a mac for work (they get their money's<br>worth in terms of my increased productivity).<br> <br>It even has an emacs compatibility mode to help folks like you &nbsp;:)<br>I haven't used that mode myself, but I believe it just tweaks the<br>key commands around to be more emacs like, and offers an option<br>to show a 'status' line in each window (which I've also not used,<br>but I'm guessing gives some feedback about where you are in some<br>big long emacs-like key command sequence).<br> <br>-matt<br> </tt>
