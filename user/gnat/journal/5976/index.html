<p>It's encouraging that everyone has good attendance.  The audience is well split between the three sessions running now: Parrot (Dan Sugalski and Simon Cozens), RT (Jesse Vincent), POE (Jos Boumans), and Mason (Dave Rolsky).<p>

Great quote from Simon's talk on Parrot: "A computer program is made out of code.  It is not made out of email messages.".<p>

The wonderful Ben Hockenhull went shopping and bought microphones and videotapes for me.  So now I'm trying to find people to record the sessions.  I can't believe that iBooks don't have microphone holes.  They have internal microphones, but nothing more.  Oy.<p>

I'll be videorecording a bunch of sessions, and Quicktiming them overnight.  The trouble is that it can take three to five times as long to encode as to view.  Oy.  And I don't have anything with a firewire port, so I'm working on borrowed iMacs. (Thanks Jarkko!)<p>

Damn my ordinal and cardinal confusion.  That's the problem with starting your cardinals at zero.  And that's neither a sports nor religious politics joke.<p>

<h2>Mason talk had 2 speakers</h2>

Brent Michalski was my co-presenter.<br> <br>Credit where it's due and all.

Yeah, but that was Brent.  Slur mumble belch curse.  That may be a presenter, but it's not really a speaker.<p>

Like, say, a USB-based mic thingie. (You shoulda asked, Nat, as I <i>just</i> happen to have one...)

I hate you, Milkman Dan.<p>

Sweet, so we'll have more mp3s tomorrow.  Hurrah!  Robert Spier is recording, and he even went around interviewing people.  Now <i>that's</i> dedication.</p><p>
