<p>Copyedits for Perl Graphics Programming.  QC1 for Web Services in Perl (which the production editor wouldn't take emailed comments on for various reasons).  Really quick turnaround of a revision to a Mac title for MacWorld.  Royalty division calculations for Essential Blogging.  Pedantic author hell for one book.  Clueless author hell for another.  Slow author hell for another.  Being a quiet asshole editor on another (sorry Simon!).  Contracts for Apache Cookbook author changes.  Scouting new PHP authors.  Signing fun fun Mac book.  Pile of Books To Read grows ever-larger.<p>

On the positive side: went to amazing invite-only conference last weekend and was exposed to much cool stuff.  Sent Allison and chromatic to a games conference to see what was cool and what was not (and to investigate putting Parrot into commercial games).  Fun fun Mac book is going to kick ass.  Kids are fantastic and wife is a godsend.<p>

Played with a Garmin GPS V and loved it.  Saw animation of airplane activity over US on Sep 11 2001.  Wow.  Orwant sent me <a href="http://www.salon.com/comics/knig/2002/08/21/knig/index.html?x
">this Iraq war cartoon</a>.  Spoke to the UI designer for Civ 3.  Wrote two new recipes for Perl Cookbook 2ed (the recipes were on mod_perl).    Started my <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">novel</a>.  Haven't drunk caffeine at home in two weeks (had some at the conference, though, which went 7:30am->3am for multiple days).  Spoke to Dan Brian on the phone.  Elaine Wonderful Elaine sent the Quicktime of Allison's tagmemics talk.<p>

Man, how come I never get asked to do stuff like this?  It's always database this, program that; it's never "Check out if these games are cool or not."

You're just not subtle enough to plant ideas in gnat's head.  (On the other hand, we did get stuck in post-football traffic on I-5.  Bouncing along at 25 miles per hour...)
