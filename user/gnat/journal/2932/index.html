<p>I made a first pass through the proposals and selected a bunch.  Man, we're going to have a killer lineup.<p>

I'm planning a *shitload* of Perl 6 and Parrot talks.  It's time for this baby to go public.  Simon's working on the parser, so we'll have a compiler by then.  Parrot's maturing fast, and Leon's going to do a session on porting other languages to Parrot.  Damian and Larry to present the Perl 6 language (as she is today).  Learn Parrot assembler.  It's all front and center, baby.<p>

Obviously I'm psyched about that, but there's also going to be other cool Perl content.  Various mod_perl talks, XML parsing, a POE tutorial ...<p>

The schedule's filling up quick--hurry up and submit proposals if you've been thinking about doing so!<p>

In the non-Perl world, I'm planning a lot of OS X content.  Open Source Java is really going to step out this year.  The database track has some big weights from MySQL and PostgreSQL in it.  I've got two sessions on SVG for the XML track, not to mention all the web services stuff.<p>

Hmm, if you buy enough beers and soft drink, you could get Larry Wall, Guido van Rossum, Rasmus Lerdorf, Monty Widenius, Jordan Hubbard (hopefully he'll be there), James Duncan Davidson, Damian Conway, Matt Sergeant, Simon Cozens, Aahz, Bruce Momjian, RMS, and a ton of other famous people all around a table.  What a picture that'd be.<p>

And the cool thing?  Most tracks aren't even half-full yet.  It's going to be a fun few weeks ahead as the last of the proposals come in and the content has to be finalized.<p>

I thought you guys didn't actually make a final decision til after the deadline?
<br>
<br>There's certainly no indication to the contrary anywhere.
<br>
<br>I've been holding off on a proposal trying to find time to make a tutorial outline for it.  Now suddenly I think that was a bad idea.
<br>
<br>Next year, how about a note saying "first come, first serve" in big letters somewhere?

O'Reilly needs to start printing the marketing materials, so Nathans first pass was just to get some of that stuff in there.  There's still plenty of room for good proposals.
<br>
<br>Some of the stuff Nathan is talking about hasn't even gotten formal proposals yet, but is just stuff that he knows must be there.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
