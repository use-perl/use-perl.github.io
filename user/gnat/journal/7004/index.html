<p>Sorry I've been so quiet.  I've got "Programming Web Services with Perl" entering production on the 19th, so I need to get the last chapters reviewed (and written!), edited, and revised before then.  I've got "Graphics Programming with Perl" entering production on the 26th, and am furiously reading and reviewing chapters for the author (after an embarrassingly long silence on my part).  And I have a ton of books to do paperwork for (feasibilities, contracts, etc.), and I'm behind on all of them.<p>

I <i>did</i> manage to make the Perl Foundation newsletter mailing list happen.  Lisa Nyman wrote the newsletter (yay Lisa!), Ask and Robert created the mailing list, and Kurt deMaagd provided the list of names (billg@microsoft.com was mysteriously not on the list).  We would have had it done sooner but there was a lot of frustrating dicking around trying to get DNS for perlfoundation.org moved over so we could run the mailing list from there.  It proved much easier to simply create the list on perl.org.<p>

Oh, and it's William's birthday this weekend.  He's 3.  He will be getting what appears to be a complete set of Spiderman-branded merchandise, thanks to his grandparents and Aunty.  I'm helping the cause with a Spiderman comic, and I'll be visiting a toy store today in search of inspiration.  Jenine got him a remote controlled car and some ToysRUs battle bots.<p>

I've been on antibiotics for almost a week now, trying to get a tooth infection under control.  It now looks like the root canal may not have gotten all the root.  Yay.  Not.<p>

So that's why I haven't been writing many journal entries lately.<p>

A Firewire drive arrived on the weekend, a present from my wonderful boss for the long nights endured during Programming PHP.  Once I can wean myself from its delights, I'll send it to David Wheeler and Elaine to copy their TPC movie files into.  That's the big problem with digital video--it's awkward to transport in any format but cassette tapes.  Unfortunately, my recorder takes different size tapes than David's, so we can't just ship tapes around.  And Elaine has DV files on her hard drive--no tapes at all!<p>

Next year I'll have the Firewire drive at OSCON and can collect DV at the conference, rather than this post-conference chaos.  Life is full of lessons.<p>

Ooops.  Yes, and Kevin Meltzer did what he said.  Sorry<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(  Obviously you're not throwing enough hissy fits, tantrums, rants, or inexplicable absences to be memorable.  (tongue half in cheek)<p>
