<p>Why didn't we go to the mysteriously named Smoke Meat BOF last night?  Because Smoked Meat is apparently something like corned beef, and I never trust anything that self-identifies as purely "meat".  Technically, possum scrotums contain "meat".  I'd like a little more specificity on my menu, please.<P><br/><br/>This morning Damian and I found Lenzo on the way to the campus, and came in together.  I was lugging my banjo, hoping to have JamBOF that night.  Mendel's feeling exhausted today, so I guess it'll be tomorrow.<P><br/><br/>I had to write the rest of the internals class before it started, but when I started I ran out of the tutorial notes that Simon had written.  I've been writing my slides based on Simon's notes, to avoid research and much scruffling through source.  The class started with only a few more slides added.<P><br/><br/>The class went surprisingly well.  I felt like I didn't do a very good job, but the attendees seemed happy.  I also feel now like I have a good grasp on how an internals class *should* go, so if I can electrocute myself daily and I hate my life enough, I'll go back and fix it.  Or I'll just give my suggestions to Simon and let him do it :-)<P><br/><br/>Lunch was a chicken sandwich and a pork sandwich, and a trip to Radio Shack for extension leads and power splitters.  The laptop power situation at this YAPC has been a little dire--one or two outlets in each room, meaning we've been running our laptops rarely if at all.  What's the point of wireless with no power?  So boom, problem solved.<P><br/><br/>And now in to Damian's talk.  I'm in that right now.  What an evil mind.  He's talked about Conway's Game of Life, Quantum::Superpositions with the Game of Life, Klingons, and   Maxwell equations, and he's still going.  It's hilariously funny (his list of Perl Demons was brilliant) and unlikely to make much sense without the slides.  Wow, the things that guy makes Powerpoint do are incredible.<P><br/><br/>More to come ...<P><br/><br/><I>--Nat</I></p>
