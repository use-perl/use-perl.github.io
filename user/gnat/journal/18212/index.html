<p>After years of shying away from browser nightmares and the stigma of scrolling popup nonsense, I'm finally getting into DHTML.  I love things like <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/">the ability to resort tables without reloading the page</a>, preventing users from double-clicking on submit buttons, and so on.  Lovely!<p>

<p>My (grudging) acceptance of JavaScript started when I took this current job. JS is the script-side of VoiceXML. As the (currently) only ECMAScript implementation, it is also used in other DOM arenas such as SVG, XForms, etc.</p>
<p>Perhaps Perl6 will bring us the means to properly embed a Perl interpreter, and with that a true "PerlScript" language not limited to the MS platform.</p>

What's really nice is when you spend a little bit of time with it and realise that it's got closures and all sorts of nice things hidden away in there.  But it's still practical too.  I love the <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/zebratables/" title="alistapart.com">zebra tables</a alistapart.com> thing.

<h2>Very cool</h2>

As someone who produces loads of data tables, this JS is really helpful.  I've done some tweaking for data types and am going to figure out how to get it to work with nested headers and columns - to add some flexibility.  This is a use of JS that can really help users.  We are asked for sorting capabilities all the time and for basic apps, this is an easy implementation.

D'oh, caveat hax0r.  The Javascript for sorting tables needs a non-trivial rewrite to make it work with Safari, which has "issues" with some of the Javascript DOM the table sorting code uses.<p>

There was an interesting suggestion in a comment on someone's blog: we all chip in $10 for a prize to get a totally cross-platform piece of Javascript to sort tables like this.  I'd go my $10 for sure.</p><p>

<h2>Javascript is pretty cool actually</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2004-07-05T18:15:10</h3>
I know I'm late, but I wanted to chip in here.<br/><br/>I've found JS to be a very nice language in a lot of ways (except maybe string manipulation, but that has gotten better). What sucks is its integration with the browser environment. I'd like to see a standalone implementation of a Javascript interpreter with which you could run Javascript code just like Perl, Python, Ruby, and friends.
