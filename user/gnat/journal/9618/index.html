<p>My colocated machine, prometheus, was hacked.  I discovered some unusual processes running today.  No files gone, so far as I know, but the assholes were running warez.  I am so pissed off.  I shut it down immediately, and would have attempted to recover, but I need a second drive to put a clean install onto, and I couldn't buy one on Christmas Eve without having to wait in line until Boxing Day.<p>

I was up against a 2pm deadline--that's when my ISP's support staff went home and I could no longer gain access to the machine room.  I found out about the hacking at 1pm.  Thirty minutes to get to a Friendly Neighbourhood Computer Store who wanted about $40 more for a 30g hard drive than Best Buy wanted for a 60gig.  So I drove back to Best Buy where I was ignored by a cashier for ten minutes while he probed the depths of the accounting system for another customer.  Finally I passed the time of no return, where I couldn't get the drive to the ISP before they shut.<p>

Driving home, visions of sugar plum fairies did not fill my head.  Instead, I was picturing the sight and sound of a baseball bat smashing the kneecaps of the teenage pricks behind it.  Have a happy Christmas, Nat!<p>

<h2>Catching the Cretins</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dws/">dws</a> on 2002-12-24T22:29:39</h3>
A friend-of-a-friend once ran naked from his house in the middle of the night, pausing only to grab a baseball bat, and caught the low-life cretin who was stealing his car radio. It's a shame that script kiddies are so much harder to catch.

And what did the naked FOAF do with the cretin?
<p>
Can you be intimidating when naked?</p>

<p>
How would you feel when confronted with a naked screaming man armed with a baseball bat?
</p><p>
He kept the perp cornered until the police arrived. (The police had been a few blocks away, investigating a prior car break-in the perp had done. They found a bunch of radios in the guy's back seat.)</p>

<h2>Any good warez?</h2>

So, did they have anything good?  Photoshop, Framemaker, NT 9.0, lots of illegal but nice-to-listen-to mp3s?  Maybe it is a new game---how popular are you based on how long it takes you to release a CD, have kiddies rip it, hack a site they did not know you owned, and upload the illegally distributed mp3s to it.<br> <br>At least now you know where the cheap hard-drives are.<br> <br>Always look for the silver lining.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>
