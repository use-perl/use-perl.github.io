<div class="span8">
<p>Microsoft has announced <a href="http://www.mappoint.net/">MapPoint.NET</a>, a web service interface to geospatial data:

<blockquote>
MapPoint .NET is a programmable XML Web Service hosted by Microsoft. Within
the hosted domain, Microsoft has aggregated valuable data such as
cartographic data (the detailed maps and routable streets), points of
interest (landmarks, hotels, restaurants, etc.), road construction and in
the future up-to-the-minute and historical traffic information, demographic
data, real-time location and more. The data is then accessible through a
SOAP API that allows you to calculate point-to-point driving directions,
render a map, find or geocode a location, and search nearby places.
Companies that want to run a proximity search or query on their locations
can leverage the MapPoint .NET Customer Services Site to upload their POI
(points-of-interest). This highly secure Extranet provides an easy to use
interface for updating your location data and managing your MapPoint .NET
subscription.
<p>
The MapPoint .NET programmable XML Web Service was built using Visual Studio
.NET and leverages the .NET Framework. MapPoint .NET can be easily
integrated into other Web Services. With a detailed WSDL (an XML description
document) and Visual Studio .NET, it is as simple as knowing the following
URL http://service.mappoint.net/find-20/ and creating a Web Reference.
</blockquote>

The full text of the announcement is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnmapnet/html/mapintronet.asp">here</a>.<p>

That's cool and useful and something MapQuest should have done a long time ago.  What's really interesting is the pricing:

<blockquote>
$15,000 for 2 Million Transactions (Flat rate)
<br>OR<br>
$299 per user for you to build an internal application
<br>OR<br>
Per transaction of $0.01 (Have to purchase in blocks of transactions
like Cell Phone Minutes)
<br>OR<br>
Negotiated rate for larger usage
</blockquote>

This is why Google released <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/">their SOAP interface</a>.  If they don't service the market, someone else will do it.  As has been recently pointed out, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/08/technology/ebusiness/08GOOG.html?pagewanted=all&position=top">Google's toughest search is for a business model</a>.  (see <a href="http://google.blogspace.com/">the google blog</a> for various google news)  If charging for high-volume access isn't already part of Google's terms and conditions, it will be soon.<p>

Google's been good and offered limited use of their service for free (1000 queries/day).  Other free services will only follow if there's public pressure and support for the free services.  That brings me to the main point of this essay.<p>

I'm reminded of Laurence Lessig's call to develop software that implements the kind of world we want.  Right now there is a lot of useful free content on the web, and very few useful web services (free or otherwise).  One future I can easily see developing is the migration from free content in HTML to paid access to the content via SOAP.<p>

If no-free-access web services become the norm (and content providers would love this--they are struggling to stay alive with free content and paid advertising) we could easily see a lot of the good, interesting, and fun free content disappear from the net.<p>

So we have a two-fold obligation: to build our own free web services, and to support free services such as google.  The alternative is a massive migration from free content to subscription-only services.<p>

I used to think that <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/hn/xml/02/04/05/020405hnoreilly.xml">my glorious leader was off-base</a> in his insistence that web services was anything but a stupid idea.  The massive takeup of google's automated search, and the obvious steps Microsoft are taking to make money off them, suddenly made me realize that Tim was basically right.  I hate it when that happens :-)<p>

<h2>Stupid Idea</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-04-16T14:55:50</h3>
I never thought web services was a stupid idea.  I just thought it wasn't a *new* idea.  Still don't.  There's nothing in web services that couldn't be done almost as easily with straight HTTP requests, like <a href="http://quote.yahoo.com/d/quotes/csv?s=lnux&amp;f=sl1d1t1c1ohgv&amp;e=.csv" title="yahoo.com">this</a yahoo.com>.  Web services just make it a little bit easier (OK, in some cases, a lot easier; but in some cases, considering the learning curve for the server side, a bit harder, too).<br> <br>That said, I've always like getting little snippets of data from the web such as the above Yahoo! request, and SOAP/XML-RPC, being a bit easier to use, makes it that much better.  Yay, web services!<br>
