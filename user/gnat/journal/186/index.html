<p>[The context for this is that the London Perlmongers were discussing <A HREF="http://safari.oreilly.com/">Safari</A>, the e-book project from O'Reilly.  I'm an O'Reilly author, having written the Perl Cookbook.  Then someone posted a link to an "ever-fabulous" Russian site with pirate copies of the CD bookshelf versions of many O'Reilly books.]<P><br/><br/>You know, I've checked my royalty statement for the Cookbook, and nary
a penny came from this Russian pirate website.  The point of <A HREF="http://safari.oreilly.com/">Safari</A> is
that you pay a very small amount of money for very convenient access,
and the author gets some of it (I believe authors get a greater
royalty via <A HREF="http://safari.oreilly.com/">Safari</A> than they do via printed books, because we don't
have printing costs).<P><br/><br/>When you don't pay money, whether you justify it because you already
own the book, or because you're a poor student, you're screwing the
authors.  "But they won't miss my $1".  Your dollar is no different
from everyone else's, and if everyone else thought the same thing,
there'd be no dollars at all for the author.<P><br/><br/>Who here has written a book?  Simon and Dave at least.  It's not easy,
is it?  It's an exercise in MISERY.  Huge numbers of lost evenings,
missed family moments, and late nights.  When I was writing the Perl
Cookbook, I had to miss a family trip to Disneyworld and a rare
talk.bizarre party in Montreal because of book deadlines.  If there's
nothing waiting at the end but your name on a book nobody buys because
some assface in Russia offers it up for free on the web, I sure as
hell wouldn't have done it.  I'd have had fun with my family and
friends, enjoyed those evenings, and spent a hell of a lot less time
worrying about the placement of commas and the difference between
"which" and "that".<P><br/><br/>So thanks for the pointer to your ever-fabulous Russian thief, but I would really prefer that you tried <A HREF="http://safari.oreilly.com/">Safari</A>.<P><br/><br/>Thanks,<P><br/><br/><I>Nat</I>
