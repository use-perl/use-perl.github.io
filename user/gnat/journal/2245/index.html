Nathan, (as the expert in the article says) reintroducing stronger encryption regulations is not the solution, not even part of a solution.
<br>
<br>I'm pretty certain there were several laws and regulations in place prohibiting flying jumbojets into skyscrapers, and look how much that helped.

The funniest (saddest?) thing about crypto regs are that *anyone* who knows what they are doing can get their hands on the strongest crypto available to people in the U.S.  If I am allowed to get it, they can get it.  It's painfully simple.  All crypto regulations do is keep American businesses from making money overseas.  They don't actually stop bad people from getting ahold of these things in the slightest.

I really dislike the export controls, but this does demonstrate that they had an effect that can sometimes be construed as positive.
<br>
<br>While knowledgeable people could get strong encryption, this case demonstrates that some people are not knowledgeable.
<br>
<br>The key issue is: When the person who foolishly chooses 40-bit encryption is a genuine black hat, the export restrictions have proven useful.  Of course, whenever it is a white hat who is foolish - they have proven detrimental.  I've sure that the tradeoff is greatly to the advantage of not having restrictions, but this <b>is</b> a real example of their benefit (as long as you believe that Al Quaeda files should be subject to examination if possible).

<br>
<br>Yes, but the laws of law enforcement dictate that dumb crooks are easier to catch regardless.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Is it possible that there will be encrytped info that we would not otherwise be able to get that, if gotten, could save a lot of lives?  Yes.  Is that likely?  No, no it isn't.  We've picked up videotapes of them describing what they've done and what they will do.  We've seen faces of people at large.  These are not hi-tech criminals.  If there is an encrypted copy in one cave, there's probably an unencrypted one in the next.

That's the irony of laws: they keep honest people from breaking them.  The bad guys don't give a shit, honestly.
<br>
<br>And yes, thanks to the US crypto regulations, there's quite a healthy crypto software industry in Europe.
<br>
<br>To limit crypto I suggest building a time machine and killing all those pesky ancient Greeks, thinking about primes...

<br>But then some bugger'd just start thinking about elliptic functions or whatever, <i>et viola</i>, another possible crypto system rears its head.

It's simpler to pass a law saying that inventing things in the past is now illegal.  (The horse has been gone so long, they'd have to rebuild the barn...)

<h2>Smart move?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Whammo/">Whammo</a> on 2002-01-18T21:57:41</h3>
I didn't see many folks - other than the Law Enforcement
and Intelligence communities - clamoring to keep them
in place.  Most of the vocal folks demanded they
be lifted - it's too late to point the finger at the
government on this one.



<h2>ITAR is still around....</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2002-01-19T03:00:47</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.eff.org/Crypto/ITAR_export/" title="eff.org">EFF ITAR archive</a eff.org> is a nice tour through crypto export restrictions through the years. <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram-0109a.html#5" title="counterpane.com">Bruce Schneier</a counterpane.com> wrote a wee bit after 11 Sept. about the possible restrictions on crypto in the future but this was also before there were any confirmed uses of crypto by OBLs people. I wouldn't be surprised to see ITAR or other legislation come back in full force even though it is pure folly.</p>
