<p>Five hours sleep, then shower, then pack.  The Dutch family who had taken up residence in my hotel room last night absconded with Simon, after some urgent phone calls, to organize dim sum.  I also left Simon with an Earthlink dialup account to use until he left on Sunday.<p>

I ran into Schwern and Dominus at the hotel lobby as I was checking out ($700ish!  Oy!).  Dominus kindly agreed to take home my copy of "A New Kind of Science" (approx. 150lb of book), which made room for the new stuff I'd acquired at the conference: t-shirts, plush toys, Buffy board game, etc.<p>

At the airport I ran into Elaine and Jarkko on their way back to Boston.  I got another heaping helping of shit from Elaine, then had a big ole steak at the airport restaurant.  That helped my hangover no end.  I slept on the uneventful flight back, and was met at the airport by William, Raley, and Jenine.  We had dinner at a delicious Italian restaurant, and were all exhausted by the time we got home.  Happiness for everyone!<p>

So ends the tale of YAPC, where much fun was had by all.<p>
