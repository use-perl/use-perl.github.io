<div class="span8">
<p>I have two QCs to look over, one recreational and one work.  The recreational is QC1 of "Learning Cocoa with Objective C, 2nd edition".  This represents a lot of work on the part of James Duncan Davidson, and is (I believe) a near-complete rewrite of the 1st edition.  I'm looking forward to getting my head around Objective C.<p>

The work QC is "Essential Blogging".  This is QC2, the second quality check.  But I think we may need a third--there are still problems like a zillion URLs ending in a / that shouldn't.  (e.g., http://www.foo.com/example.html/)  Gnash.<p>

A QC is a quality control check.  After an author turns in their final draft, it's converted to a publishing format (XML or Frame) and copyedited and line-broken.  The result is sent out to authors and editor for checking--this is QC1.  Then it's page broken, indexed, and sent out for QC2.  QC2 is only a week or so before it goes to the printer.<p>

So now I'm going through PDFs searching for "http://" and pointing out buggered URLs.  Lucky me!<p>

<h2>Bad URLs</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2002-08-12T19:17:16</h3>
While you're at it, please get rid of all the extraneous index.html URLs, too, as in http://www.petdance.com/index.html instead of http://www.petdance.com/
<p>
That's gotta be my #1 pet peeve of URLs anywhere.</p>

<p>I second that.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p> <i>http://www.petdance.com/index.html</i>
</p><p>If you know that the web server is going to server up index.html and that's the file you are interested in referencing, I can see no bothering other people with the filename. However, the copyeditors at ORA have no clue about web server configurations. For instance, I frequently have index.pl files in the DocumentIndex list. Sometimes I'll have both an index.html and an index.pl (one of them is probably out of date). I guess I'm happy enough with the explicit filenames as long as those names are accurate. If someone is just adding 'index.html' to a trailing slash, that's bad.</p>

URLs should be as short as possible, especially printed ones in a book.  Anything that can shorten the typing (and potential errors) of the reader is good.
<p>
As to having index.html and index.pl in the same directory, that's the whole point of NOT specifying a file.  Say you started with foo.com/dir/index.html, and now you realize you need some dynamic stuff.  Now you have to point at foo.com/dir/index.pl.  If you'd just started with foo.com/dir/, then the index.html to index.pl transformation could have happened behind the scenes with no one being the wiser.</p>
