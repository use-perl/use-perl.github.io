<p>Got up early and Bree (my sister) and I met Damian in the gym around 6:15.  Damian worked us like the weak fools we are, and we left limping and whipped.  That said, I felt GREAT during the day.  He said it would be addictive ... first hit is free ....<P><br/><br/>Breakfast was in the HUGE tent erected between the two towers.  The place was humming, and I was really pleased.  I went to a Java conference earlier in the year, and it was quite depressing.  They were all talking about who was losing their jobs.  This conference is definitely not that--it's zinging!<P><br/><br/>I hung out in the speaker room most of the day, trying to write my perl5-porters impressions, but that turned out to be very difficult.  There were too many interesting people!  Rael Dornfest, fellow O'Reilly hacker; Brian Ingerson, author of Inline.pm; Adam Turoff; Dan Brian (XML tutorial presenter); Sean Burke, who brought a copy of the Codex Seraphinianus (I'm sure I misspelled that); and far too many others.<P><br/><br/>In the evening were the impressions, a ton of fun even though I accidentally came up with the same idea as Ronald Kimball (Damian Conway as Crocodile Hunter was apparently very low hanging fruit).  Then we perl5-porters had a meeting, which (thankfully) featured no thrown cups.<P><br/><br/>The big decision from the p5p meeting (as far as I'm concerned) is what to do next year for p5p meeting.  We decided to meet briefly at the start of the week to go over what Larry and the pumpkings would say, so there were no surprises, and to raise issues we should talk about among ourselves during the week.  At the end of the week, probably the Saturday after the conference, we'd meet for a full-day meeting.  That meeting would be broken into periods of discussion followed by break-out groups to talk about and try to solve the problems.<P><br/><br/>I finally got to bed at 11pm.  Urgh!<P><br/><br/><I>--Nat</I></p>
