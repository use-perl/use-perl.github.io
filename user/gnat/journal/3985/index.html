<p>9/10.<p>

It's a murder mystery set on a reality tv show like Big Brother, where contestants are locked in a house with a zillion video cameras.  One is murdered!  Whodunnit and how?<p>

Since I started writing one of these, I've become a lot better at guessing whodunnit, how, and why.  I can smell red herrings and see foreshadowed solutions.  But even though I knew whodunnit, I had a wonderful time confirming it.<p>

Ben Elton is a brilliant writer, and skewers television and hip youths with a sharpened pen.  But being Ben Elton, he also skewers the protagonist, the left, the right, and everyone in between.<p>

And that's where it lost the point.  It doesn't have a very satisfying resolution, because you never feel like you identified 100% with anyone.  Even the protagonist, who has all the opinions we do and isn't afraid to say them, comes off as flawed and self-serving and not completely likable.<p>

This is nothing new with Elton, though--if you believe that you can learn about him from his books, you'd think he hated all humanity.  He's got a very strange idea of a happy ending, and nobody tends to do well in the end.  Which is great for scoring points, but is a bit of a downer for the reader.<p>

Hence 9/10.  As shameful as it is to say it, the book would have been complete with a truly happy ending.  I'm such a traditionalist.<p>
