<p>The kids had a meltdown in the morning, because they didn't get a lot of sleep thanks to the jazz and blues festival right outside our window.  I went with several London.pmites to a local Mac store and lusted after an iSight while failing completely to get a replacement power supply (apparently they need my laptop's serial number, dammit).<p>

Jenine and I took the kids for a walk that night, hoping to find dinner.  We caught the bus, but left Raley's doll on it.  Daddy chasing bus ensues.  Raley melted down on the bus, so we might have been in a bit of a hurry to leave.  Anyway, I got doll back.  Then we couldn't find a restaurant (!) and ended up at Pizza Schmizza, which is local for "thin crust greasy pizza".  Raley melted down again.  We walked home.<p>

Stressful baby day for Jenine and (to a lesser extent) me.  I made sure to put the kids down early and get a good night's sleep.<p>

Kids aside, I registered and ran into lots of people.  Dan Sugalski wandered past the window when we were having breakfast in the morning.  It was good to see the conferences team again, not to mention all the Perl hackers.  So many people that I only see once a year ...<p>

<h2>Pizza Schmizza is simply awful (IMHO)</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2003-07-08T06:05:46</h3>
<p>Pizza Schmizza?  Oh, you poor fellow.  Despite the fact that I've met a few locals who swear by it, I can't stand it.  There are few things that I have found more disgusting than a spaghetti pizza.  Imagine a pizza covered in what resembles a pile of bloody worms.</p>

<p>If we meet up at the conference, perhaps I'll have the time to point out the very hidden restaurant with some of the best (and cheapest!) Mexican food in Portland.  It's tucked away in an alley, looks like a greasy diner and, unfortunately, you can't bring children because the restaurant doesn't have its own bathroom.  It shares one with a strip club and yes, you have to walk through the club to get to the bathroom.  It's a damned shame because the food is quite good.</p>



<h2>power rationing</h2>

<blockquote><div>failing completely to get a replacement power supply (apparently they need my laptop's serial number, dammit).</div></blockquote>
<p>Is there a quota on power supplies? Are they cross subsidised, and only known Apple owners are allowed to buy them? Is Steve Jobs just a control freak and wants to know everyone's name, number and least favourite sexual position? It all makes little sense.</p>

Ha, no--no subsidies or rationing.  It's just that if I want one for <i>free</i> under warranty because Apple made a power supply whose rubber doohickeys separate and expose bare wires which is JUST WHAT YOU WANT IN A POWER SUPPLY, EXPOSED WIRES! ahem, well then I need to supply my serial number so Apple can verify it's still under warranty.  Man, I hope it's still under warranty--$90 yes NINETY DOLLARS to buy one.<p>
