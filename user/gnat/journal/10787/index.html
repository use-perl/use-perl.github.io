<p>What font do you use in your terminal window?  I'm a Lucida Sans Typewriter fan myself.  I've just started a radical experiment, using a non-monospaced font.  When I need to edit code, I open a window with a monospaced font, but for most things, it seems to be a little more readable to have a proportionally-spaced font on the screen.  The only problem is that the terminal window is about twice as wide as it needs to be, apparently because it's allocating space of a row of 'm's.<p>

<p>I use Courier New.  Nothing original about it, but it works.</p>

<p>While on the subject of proportional fonts, who's the friggin' genius who made the proportional "Microsoft Sans Serif" font the default option for stored procedures and SQL in MS SQL Server?  Aargh!  The pain, the pain!  Of course, I can go to <tt>Tools -&gt; Font</tt> and change it, but it doesn't <em>do</em> anything other than warn me that I chose a non-standard font.</p>

<p>...grumble...</p>

Monaco *20pt*? Isn't that a little... large?<br> <br>Personally, I've always used Monaco 9, preferably the pre Mac OS 8.6 version (which has smaller punctuation, although the I and l and 0 and O are indistinguishable, which used to be the sort of annoyance that got Profont a following. Still, I like it, enough to stick it in ~/Library/Fonts/).<br> <br>That gives me 4 80x24 Terminals (or MacSSH windows, when I'm back in Mac OS 9) on my 1024x768 display, which seems about right. Black on white, of course, the way... someone at Apple, I suppose, intended it.<br> <br>It's also my default for monospaced fonts in web browsers (although annoyingly Safari insists in anti-aliasing it even at 9pt).

The one true font, of course: <tt>fixed</tt> in an xterm window.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
I get two 80x40 xterms on the screen side-by-side in an 1024x768 window, with about 1/4 of the screen unused (by xterms) on the bottom.  Using <tt>fixed</tt> has the added benefit of being the only configuration that will properly render mutt's ascii graphics for thread display.

I've been using 80x40 xterms with <tt>fixed</tt> font for so many years now, anything else just looks <i>strange</i>.</p>

The dots in the middle of the zeros is really great.<br> </p><p>I've heard people use it in Linux, which is why Microsoft withdrew it from their web site, but it's still out there, and the license allows for free distribution, if I remember correctly.<br></p>

<h2>ProFont</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2003-02-27T04:36:19</h3>
ProFont is my favorite; I use it in Terminal, BBEdit, Eudora, Chimera, everything where I need one.  I use a 9-point, which a lot of people find to be too small.<br> <br>ProFont is basically Monaco with distinguishable 1lI0O etc., but the current Monaco is improved in that regard.  I think ProFont looks best at 9 points, Monaco at slightly larger points, and ProFont at much larger points (say, 36).

Best mono font for terminal use (and source code) is the HVFont (www.procon.con.au/Fonts.htm).
The TTF version HVEdit is much clearer than ProFont
and the raster version is brilliant in code editors even at 8 pts.
