<p>During a garage sale cleanout, I found my set of the Activision releases of classic Infocom text adventures.  I love those puppies.  I can play them on my Pilot, on my laptop, or on my Commodore 64.  There's even <A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Games-Rezrov">a Perl interpreter</A>.  Some of the most fun I had when I was learning about computers came from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy game.<P><br/><br/>If you're missing games, or want them in their original packaging, or maybe just want to own the props from teh games, look no further than <A HREF="http://www.if-legends.org/user/yois/">Ye Olde Infocom Shoppe</A>.  This
guy loves his Infocom, and I don't know about you, but I'd much rather buy from someone who knows what he's dealing in than some Mom cleaning out her son's room and selling it all via <A HREF="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</A>.<P><br/><br/>If you're looking for info on Infocom games, try <A HREF="http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/">Peter's Infocom Page</A> (he even has some of the game files for download).  Man, all this nostalgia reminds me of the time in the early days of the net that I tracked down a bunch of the Infocom designers and programmers, and sent them fanboy email.  A couple were even polite enough to respond.  Remember the good old days, when a celebrity receiving fan e-mail was something rare?<P><br/><br/>If you want to write your own text adventures ("interactive fiction" it's now called, as people are writing everything from scifi humour games to surrealist experiences) look no further than <A HREF="http://www.gnelson.demon.co.uk/inform.html">Graham Nelson's Inform</A>.  It's a language and a compiler, which spits out Infocom game files.<P><br/><br/>In case you're curious, the game files are programs for a virtual machine, the Z-machine.  Infocom was inventing machines that didn't exist a decade before Java was even a twinkle in Sun's eye.  There are <A HREF="ftp://ftp.gmd.de/if-archive/infocom/interpreters/">Z-machine interpreters</A> for almost every system (Rezrov is the Perl z-machine interpreter).  I wonder how long it will take someone to make a Perl compiler backend for Z-code, so you can write adventure games in Perl?<P><br/><br/>Uhoh, I think I just lost <A HREF="http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=display&uid=89">Simon</A> his weekend :-)<P><br/><br/><I>Nat</I></p>
