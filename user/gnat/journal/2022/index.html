<p>Another new editor in our group isn't, though.  I feel awful and don't know what to say to her.<P><br/><br/><I>--Nat</I></p>

<h2>Something, At Least</h2>

Just for starters, "Good luck, and I'm really sorry," off the top of my head.
<p>
Maybe it'll sound like what others have said; but it's also possible nobody's said anything to her, due to the awkwardness of the situation.
</p><p>
Nobody said anything to me when I got laid off (even if it was a crappy tech support job, it was the first thing even related to computers I did) and I felt lousy about it.  Say something.</p>



<h2>lay offs...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/godoy/">godoy</a> on 2002-01-10T02:32:19</h3>
I agree with chaoticset. Say something.
<br>
<br>I wish I never come through this. I'm in my third job and I've always asked to leave.
<br>
<br>We had several lay offs last year (about half of the company -- we were 299 people on March 2001 and we are near 160 now) and the tension gets high, people can't work, etc.
<br>
<br>At least wish her good luck. Give your business card and, if you can, help her to get in touch with other companies.
<br>
<br>I hope everything gets better soon.
