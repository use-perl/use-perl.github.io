<p>I'm up to 16.17, making lots of changes as I go.  A lot of it is just to use lexical filehandles, but there's been some changes to Perl that require documentation (e.g., safe signals).  Many thanks to poor Jarkko, who not only spent years patching to make 5.8, but who now has to endure my questions about it.<p>

Boy, it sure feels good to remove that long "SIGNALS SUCK!  YOU WILL COREDUMP!" section, even though I have to replace it with a smaller "well, things won't coredump but if you have a particularly hostile standard library then you may, perhaps, never receive your signals."<p>

That's progress!<p>

When is it expected to be out? I can't wait<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

The goal is to have it out by OSCON.  February will be hell, but I think we can do it.<p>

<h2>Perl XP Cookbook</h2>

I just saw the Java XP Cookbook on the ora.com 'upcomming titles' list.<br> <br>Any chance of one of those happening in perl land?<br> <br>Maybe Schwern, Ovid and a few others could be coaxed into throwing together some chapters?<br> <br>-matt

Actually, there's good news a-coming for you Perl and XP people.  More I cannot say<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<p>

I'm assuming you mean something more interesting than 'the sun shall rise tomorrow', so I'll wait in baited anticipation for whatever-it-is<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>-matt

<p>Hmm, just found this discussion thanks to wickline.  I'm already <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jdavidb/journal/11371" title="perl.org">on the record</a perl.org> as saying I will jump at the chance for a Perl and XP cookbook.  Put me on your preorder list.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Oh, and looking at the table of contents for the Java XP Cookbook, my chief complaint is that it appears to focus more on tools than techniques.  Hint, hint.  That's not to say it didn't look like an equivalent Perl book wouldn't be invaluable, just that I'd rather see more on technique.  A Perl Testing Cookbook might be a good idea, as well.</p>
