<p>I'm not trying to shill an O'Reilly book, I promise.  I wanted to learn about <a href="http://www.masonhq.com/">Mason</a> on short notice.  I couldn't wait the few days it would take the O'Reilly Mothership to fedex me a copy of the Mason book.  And then I remembered it was online ...<p>

Yes, <a href="http://www.masonbook.com/">masonbook.com</a> is awesome.  And beautiful.  When I've finished writing the Cookbook (goal: be done writing by Friday night so I can enjoy the weekend and it can all go to production on Tuesday) I want to use their pseudopod-to-HTML converter to see what the Cookbook looks like.<p>

So yes, the Mason book is good.  I struggled a little with the introduction to Mason, but I think I have a handle on it now.  autohandlers are sweet!  Already I'm looking around for a web site to build with Mason.  I might try my hand at the retail site my Dad's company wants to build ...<p>

I had to ask on #perl how <a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/">the Template Toolkit</a> compares to Mason.  The Mason book rather glossed over that (they said they don't view TT as competition, but they didn't say why).  In the Cookbook I need to steer people to the right tool for their problem, so I need to know what problems each is suited for.<p>

When you ask people that question, though, the answer you get depends on whether you asked a Mason user or a Template Toolkit user.  Some people (<a href="http://www.autrijus.org/">Autrijus</a> and <a href="http://www.bestpractical.com/rt">JesseTheRTGuy</a>) had enough experience with both to answer that question.  In a way it's a lot like asking "when should I use Perl over Python?" (yes, I know the answer to that question is "always" :-)<p>

I think I have it down, though, so now I just need to distill 250 pages of documentation into three Cookbook pages and I'll be set! :-)<p>

Anyway, kudos to Dave and Ken for a bang-up job.  I can think of two departments within O'Reilly for whom this book should be mandatory reading ... :-)<p>

<h2>Integrated vs templating</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/koschei/">koschei</a> on 2003-05-22T23:21:49</h3>
Very generally speaking, to me, a heavy mason user and a light TT user (but I do find them both useful), I see the difference as being TT encouraging your template/code abstraction to be more pure while Mason is more web geared and template directed. It's Mason's inheritence scheme that really makes me happy.<br> <br>Mason, I feel more like I'm writing web pages; TT I feel more like I'm writing logic. It's just how I feel about it =)

<h2>Mason vs TT</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ask/">ask</a> on 2003-05-23T08:39:20</h3>
I've used both quite a bit for both pet- and Really Big projects.<br> <br>The elevator version:<br> <br>Mason is like PHP on steroids.  And with perl syntax.<br>In a web context TT is a balanced "MVC" toolkit for web applications.<br> <br>Mason is best as a "callback" system and TT is mostly used as a "pipeline" system.  They can both be used as the other.<br> <br>In my experience "callback" is best for getting things done in a hurry.   Mason is absolutely fantastic for this.  I use Mason for quick web hacks all the time.<br> <br>6 months later I am happier maintaining the mostly-pipeline systems.<br> <br>Perrin wrote a great article about <a href="http://perl.apache.org/docs/tutorials/tmpl/comparison/comparison.html" title="apache.org">choosing a template system</a apache.org>.
