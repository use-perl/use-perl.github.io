<p><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/04/24/BU94845.DTL&type=business">from SF Gate</a>:
<blockquote>
In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, 321 Studios of
St. Louis wants a judge to declare that its product, DVD Copy Plus, does
not violate copyright laws. 
<p>
"It's a critical issue in this digital age," said 321 President Robert
Moore, who started the company in July as a hobby. "Someone's got to stand
up and say it's wrong when you can't make a copy of something you own." 
<p>
The program, based on controversial open-source code that descrambles DVD
encryption, is designed to let users make a backup copy of a DVD movie. The
suit argues that copyright laws allow such copying for personal use. 
<p>
Moore, a veteran software developer, has sold 75,000 copies of DVD Copy
Plus over the Internet. The firm has 32 employees and has opened offices in
three cities, including Berkeley, with hopes of expanding into retail stores.

<h2>Buddy tried it</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gizmo_mathboy/">gizmo_mathboy</a> on 2002-04-25T18:38:46</h3>
I emailed one of my buddies about this software. He tried it and was sort of impressed. Basically it was a HOWTO for using the freeware that is available.<br> <br>Apparently the freeware that DVD Copy Plus "uses" have non-intuitive instructions and interface. The DVD Copy Plus Software just gives help, support, screenshots, and the like to make it easier to copy your DVD into VCD format.<br> <br>My buddy decided that it really wasn't worth it for the US$40 to buy it (which he did).<br> <br>I hope they win their case but too bad they have to resort to spam (I've probably received 3 emails about this product in the last 2 days) to sell their product. Oh well.
