<p>William loves the binoculars I got Jenine for Christmas.  He can see prairie dogs from our front door, but they're a good distance away so really all he's seeing are tiny moving spots.<P><br/><br/>I'd like to take him to see some up close and personal.  This is proving quite the challenge--there used to be huge prairie dog colonies on the acres of open space around us.  However, the city (in its infinite wisdom and glory) gassed them all and has huge earthmoving gear in, building a park.  A park.  There are already three parks within a mile of our house, none of which I've ever seen a crowd at, so we obviously need another.<P><br/><br/>I'm pissed because they've taken away the open space and prairie dogs that I <B>do</B> want, and are building a Disnified Nature Park that I <B>don't</B> want.  Finding another prairie dog colony around here, one that William and I can get close to, just got a damn sight harder.  Bastards.<P><br/><br/><I>--Nat</I></p>

<h2>Prarie dogs</h2>

Unfortunately, they have a tendency to carry the plague (as in, yes, bubonic plague). Treatable with antibiotics now, but still nasty. Probably the city looked at the health risks and decided to kill off the prarie dogs instead of having to worry about being sued. Not that this isn't sad and doesn't suck.
<br>
<br>If you do visit the prarie dogs, be careful to watch out for fleas; and the 'dogs tend to bite as well.
