<p>There are some lovely Sandman collections available now, with numbers on the front to tell you which volume you're buying.  Go out and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1563890119/">buy Volume 1</a>.  You won't regret it.  I wonder why I put it off so long ...<p>

And if you don't like volume 1, get volume 2. It's when Sandman starts to feel like Sandman. The last two volumes are simply marvellous though.

Yeah, it took him a while to figure out how to do what he wanted to do.  The mysterious appearance and disappearance of the DC Universe is funny, as I'm up to Book IV and haven't noticed it reappear.<p>

The script at the end of Vol II or III (I can't remember which) was really interesting.  It's almost a movie.  I'm amazed at the detail in which he visualizes the comic before it's drawn.</p><p>

Volume 3 - the one with "A Midsummer Night's Dream". um. Dream Country.<br> <br>It's interesting that you say that. Gaiman drawing comics from a movie-like script. Whereas those Matrix fellows made a movie from a comic-like script, even down to drawing panels and such.<br> <br>The DC Universe won't get much of a look in unless you happen to follow some esoteric lines. Hy Bender wrote a book, "The Sandman Companion" which covers a lot of the references and such.<br> <br>Oh, and you should pick up the two Death collections if you can =)

<i>It's interesting that you say that. Gaiman drawing comics from a movie-like script. Whereas those Matrix fellows made a movie from a comic-like script, even down to drawing panels and such.</i> <p>

Almost every movie is storyboarded--it helps the director know what the movie will look like, and the production crew to know what they have to build, where to put the cameras, where to put the lights, and so on.</p><p>

My previous encounter with Gaiman was his books, so it was interesting to see something with different conventions.  It made me wonder how much more he knows but doesn't tell about the people in his novels.  ("I'd always imagined him with green socks, actually, not brown")</p><p>

<i>Oh, and you should pick up the two Death collections if you can =)</i>

I think I have the first somewhere here.  I'll chew through the Sandman books first, though--my wallet's hurting at the cost of those!</p><p>

<h2>Sandman #1</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dlc/">dlc</a> on 2003-06-26T14:00:50</h3>
<p>I just recently learned that I own a Sandman #1, in near mint condition.  Imagine my surprise!  Many of my high school friends were into comics big-time, and were constantly telling me, "You should buy one of these, it's pretty good".  As a result, I have a large collection of random books, most of which I have no recollection of having purchased, and which are almost invariably unopened, still in the plastic bag with the backer board...</p>
<p>I think I hear E-Bay calling my name.</p>
