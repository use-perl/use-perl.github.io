<p>Just looking at what it would cost for me to attend YAPC::Europe.  This is complicated by the fact that after biocon, Jenine says I can never ever leave her alone with the kids again.  I'm not sure if it was because I had a room with a hot tub, or because she was alone with the kids for a week, but either way I'm either taking her with me or not going to conferences in the future.<p>

My new favourite airfare shop <a href="http://www.discountflights.com/">discountflights.com</A> tells me it'll cost at least $2000 for The Horde to make that trip.  Then ~$500 for budget hotel ... it all adds up.<p>

That's why I'm trying to avoid it for as long as possible.

<p>Well, noone said you <i>have</i> to replicate. Get a vasectomy as it's covered by nearly all health plans, it's reversible and can be done on an outpatient basis in a short amount of time.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Actually, that's been considered.  I'm not opposed to reproduction; I'm mostly opposed to <em>thoughtless</em> reproduction.  I'm kind of ambivalent about it; the SOTF is all for it.  It remains to be seen what's going to happen.
<p>
If and when we've got the money, <em>and</em> there's a fairly good reason, then I'm okay with it.</p>

<p>You'll be waiting a long time since if you stop to think about it and the finances chances are you'll summer in the Caribbean instead and have St. Bernards.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I'm mostly hoping the SOTF agrees.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
<p>
Not St. Bernards, though...prefer terriers.  Border Terriers are a personal favorite of mine.</p>

They're going to gang up on us soon. Karen's already plotting Something Evil because of YAPC::Europe. She, Jenine, and Pudge's wife are going to do something truly horrible to us.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>You just have to remember to bring back something cool to make it look like you spent 5 minutes thinking about them inbetween the hot tubbing and beers out with the guys. Munich has a fine array of chocolate and such to choose from<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Grod not so dumb, Grod buy chocolate!</p>
