<p>I'll be at ApacheCon next week.  So of course the Web Services in Perl QC2 and the Graphics QC1 are both scheduled for that week.  Because I can get SO MUCH DONE when I'm at a bloody conference.  Ugh.<p>

Speaking of web services, I'm automating some of the data collection for the feasibilities we have to do before we can sign a book.  I'm installing Frontier::RPC to talk to the web service of our Amazon mining system, so I can automatically fetch sales rankings, publication date, author, etc. for competitive titles through keyword searches.  All formatted correctly for feasibilities.<p>

New find: <a href="http://www.cheapotravel.com/">cheapotravel</a>.  It seems like a frontend for Expedia, but its Vegas hotel booking system is <i>much</i> nicer than Expedia's.<p>

I was exposed to the strange small world phenomenon on Tuesday.  We drove to Boulder so I could give a talk at SoftPro books.  Slipped in to the Olive Garden for dinner and who should we run into but Tom.  Very strange.  He was clutching the new Lord of the Rings DVD set and planned to watch it all that night.<p>

Installed and played with Mac::Carbon briefly.  Now I'm trying to think of things to do with it.  If only iCal and iChat were scriptable to the point where I could specify a chat to be spoken, or have spoken alarms ("brace yourself, it's editorial meeting time").<p>

<h2>Net::ICal and cron!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-11-14T20:51:38</h3>
You could have a cronjob read your iCal files with Net::ICal and then speak your meetings<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...



<h2>Eh?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rjray/">rjray</a> on 2002-11-14T22:21:11</h3>
<p>Why in the world would you be using <tt>Frontier::RPC</tt> for your client? Ken has handed the sourcebase over to someone who was going to have it out under a new name (<tt>RPC::XMLSimple</tt>) "real soon now", and the new version hasn't shown yet. Granted, I'm biased, but I would have thought you'd at least use <tt>XMLRPC::Lite</tt>...</p>

The sample code (two years old, I think) that I was given used Frontier::RPC and I was trying to avoid introducing multiple simultaneous changes.<p>
