<div class="span8">
<p><b>Tuesday</b>: an author sent heated words my way, which pretty much shat on my afternoon as I tried to figure out how to deal with it.<p>

<b>Wednesday</b> was much better--I set ORA on the track of an <i>awesome</i> keynoter for <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/">OSCON</a>.  I don't want to mention who it is until they confirm--there'd be nothing worse than being bloody Slashdotted "OSCON will have X!" only to have to publicly admit that we couldn't afford them :-)<p>

<b>Thursday</b>: developed the next edition of "Programming Web Services with SOAP", and got the authors into it.  Worked on a s00per s33kr1t book I'm doing on short notice.  It's a Wroxish book, only I intend to edit pretty heavily to ensure that it has a consistent voice.  More on this once it decloaks.<p>

<b>Friday</b>: found <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/mil.millington/things.html">this</a>.  We had an utter bozo write to us, complaining that we were shoving a "liberal feminazi agenda" down his throat with our house style of alternating "he" and "she" in examples.  I took great pleasure in ridiculing his letter within O'Reilly.  Sad to say, this made my day :-)<p>

I went out for drinkies with <a href="http://www.frii.net/">former coworkers</a> and learned all about their plans to take over the world.  One of my former coworkers is now working for some massive porn conglomerate, which owns about half the porn sites in the world.  "You want codes, man?  I can get you codes!"  He's in the engineering side, not the "development" (i.e., paying small amounts of money to unemployed women who will burn in hell when the day of Judgement comes :-)<p>

<h2>OSCon Keynotes</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2002-05-07T15:29:19</h3>
So you've got someone really impressive in the works.  Could it be one of these folks?
<ul>
<li>Philip K. Dick:  Truth really is stranger than fiction</li>
<li>Isaac Asimov: The coming of the robotic age</li>
<li>J.R.R. Tolkien: How Middle Earth foretold the dawn of Perl</li>
<li>Gene Rodenberry: How the 24th Century presumed Open Source all along</li>
<li>Rod Serling: Open Source and the Twilight Zone</li>
<li>Seymour Cray: Building High Performance Systems from Low-Performance components</li>
<li>Edsger Dijkstra: Closed Source Considered Harmful</li>
<li>R. Adm. Grace Hopper: How to build a technology for the ages</li>
<li>Robert Stevens: Programming the Network, a retrospective</li>
</ul>
If you could pull <b>any</b> of those speakers to OSCon, you would truly be a god among men.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

You forgot:<br> <br>Woz: How I'm working on PrEV, a perl version of the NeXT OS.

<h2>Feminazi</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-05-08T12:59:16</h3>
It's not liberal feminazi agendas that cause most people to alternate he/she, but I do find that it's often annoying and disruptive<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... however, perhaps it's more important to prove that you aren't contributing to the sexism in the industry than to write sanely.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br>
