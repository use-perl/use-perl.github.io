<p>I played in a band in New Zealand over the summer, and we did some Irish fiddle tunes.  It's got me hooked.  In the last two weeks I've bought a bunch of CDs, mostly from <A HREF="http://www.half.com/">half.com</A>.<P><br/><br/>I started with a few compilations, to help me work out what I liked and what I didn't:<br/><br/><UL>
<LI>"Traditional Music of Ireland" (Celt 9006).  13 tracks with a good mixture of singing (which I'm not fond of) and instrumentals (which I am).<P><br/><br/><LI>"The Twentieth Century Collection" (Green Linnet GLCD 106).  A double CD of yumminess.  Green Linnet are the Big Name in this kind of music, it seems, and this CD is a collection of the owner's favourites.  I found a lot of music I like on these CDs, and I've got a lot to buy.  The Green Linnet founder's comments on the liner notes are particularly interesting.  I was listening with half an ear while working, when suddenly this FANTASTIC track came on.  I sat up in my chair and scrabbled for the liner notes.  "Everyone remembers where they were when they first heard the Bothy Band" said the founder.  Yup, I guess I will.  Incredible stuff!
</UL><br/><br/>So then I bought a few CDs by individual artists:<br/><br/><UL>
<LI><I>Brendan Begley</I>, "We Won't Go Home 'Til Morning" (Kells KM-9510).  He's a great accordion player.  I know you all think I've lost my mind ("accordion?  euch!") but it really seems to work in Irish music.  I likee a lot.<P><br/><br/><LI><I>Altan</I>, "Runaway Sunday" (Virgin DPRO-12738).  I'm not a big fan of singing in any music, so I generally skip the vocal tracks.  But the instrumentals are good.<br/><br/></UL><br/><br/>I figure I have another six or so CDs in the mail.  Jenine (wife) is going to kill me when she finds out :-).  It's an addiction, though--once you get bitten by the bug, there's no going back.  It's a bit like Ebola in that respect, only with a beat.<P><br/><br/>Nat</p>
