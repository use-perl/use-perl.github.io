<h2>Active Sentences</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Theory/">Theory</a> on 2002-09-25T23:02:13</h3>
<p>Here's another one:</p>

<p>Avoid passive sentences. Make your verbs active! Don't be afraid to let the subject of your sentence take action, even if in reality (whatever <i>that</i> is) it's an inert object.</p>

<p>Example: Instead of &quot;That book was blowing my mind,&quot; try &quot;That book blew my mind!&quot;</p>

The litmus test: mentally try the sentence with "it is" instead. If it works (it'll stick out like a sore thumb if it's wrong), you want "it's".</p>

Is is just me, or are there vast seas of difference between its/it's confusion and arbitrary latin-derived strictures about future tense and passive voice?  The former is just a spelling error, and one way (whichever one its;) is misspelled.  The latter are violations of rules that help with formal writing, but are rarely heard of otherwise, and are routinely violated in speech.  The guy on the street has no idea what you're talking about (or no idea of what about which you are talking?) -- although he probably appreciates it.

Almost every "rule" is violated in spoken language (and anyway, who can <i>hear</i> the difference between "its" and "it's"?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).<p>

That's okay for most people (less okay for professional orators such as politicians, not that I'm thinking of a particular jackass with his finger on the nukular button).  In case it wasn't clear, I was talking about writing that I have to edit for publication.</p><p>

When you're writing, you have only the words to communicate with.  And printed words are a very clumsy way to communicate (think of the conversions involved: thoughts to words in head, words in head to words on page, words on page to words in head, words in head back to thoughts--hopefully the same thoughts the writer had!).  Rules of subject/verb agreement, tense, even punctuation, help us make sense of the written word.  Just as Perl tries to make sense of crackheaded code but will often fail, people can try to make sense of crackheaded writing but will often fail.</p><p>

I guess I don't understand mistaking its for it's, because once you unpack it, the mistake's right there -- "X rain" is either "it is rain" (it's) or "the rain belonging to it" (its).  So while it may be easy to misspell, there's a straightforward way to bring language intuitions to bear on the problem.  Plus, I thought it was "good style" to avoid contractions in formal writing.  Maybe this is why...

<p>On the other hand, if asked whether I should say "the book which I like" or "the book that I like", it's darned hard to tell, and I don't know of a similar "unpacking" procedure to make things clear (if you know of one, please let us know!).  I'd probably pick "that", because I gather that "which" is almost always wrong, so the odds are better that way.  To get it right, I have to memorize and internalize some explicit grammar rule, rather than relying on intuitions about what "sounds right".

</p><p>(As for clarity in techincal writing, I say we go for the IETF approach -- write up a 20-page document defining MUST, SHOULD, and MAY in agonizing detail, then write then in ALL CAPS to warn the reader that they aren't ordinary WORDS<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>

Perhaps in spoken English, but in written English the rule is the same for every culture.  <i>That</i> helps you identify something, whereas <i>which</i> gives you more information.  Consider<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<p><blockquote><div> <i>Matt kicked the dog that barked.</i> </div></blockquote>

There may have been several dogs.  One barked.  Matt kicked it.<p>

Compare that to this<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p><p><blockquote><div> <i>Matt kicked the dog, which barked.</i> </div></blockquote>

There was one dog.  Matt kicked it.  It then barked.<p>

Gwammaticians call the former a defining or restricting clause, whereas the latter is a non-restrictive.  The non-restrictive clauses (those giving more information about something already clearly identified) can always be put in parentheses or prefixed by a comma.  So I always say "would I have put a comma in front of that?  If so, then use <i>which</i>".</p><p>

This rule may only work because I have stronger punctuation fu than grammar fu<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>

As for <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i>, it's a very English thing.  The grammar books waffle about shades of meaning (<i>shall</i> implying "obligation, necessity, or permission" and <i>will</i> implying "resolve or determination") but nobody has ever convinced me that anybody who uses those words knows this rule or consistently employs it.<p>

There is a difference, Gill always quotes the pair: "I shall drown! No one will save me." and "I will drown! No one shall save me." <br> <br>One implies intent on the part of the drowner (the latter I think), and the other implies the inevitable workings of a natural process.<br> <br>And, on googling for those phrases I find that my gut feeling was right.<br> <br>However, note that it's one of those irregular verbs... "I shall, you will, he will" implies 'Inevitable, no intent involved'. "I will, you shall, he shall" implies 'obligation/intent'.

I think "its" and "it's" confusion arises because of possessives.  Other words use "'s" to indicate possession: "I kicked the dog's bollocks".  So you assume a pattern and apply the pattern: "I kicked it's bollocks".  BZZZT. <p>

"It's" used to be possessive in English, but that changed.  "Its" is the possessive form, and "it's" is a contraction for "it is".  So now when you have to kick a dog you aim for "its bollocks", and when you listen to "the Bush doctrine" you think "it's bollocks".</p><p>

This would probably make more sense to Americans if they knew what "bollocks" meant<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>

<blockquote><div> <i>if you know of one, please let us know!</i> </div></blockquote>

<p>Here's the rule I always use: I recite to myself, "Dogs which bite" and "Dogs that bite". Nat's right about the comma, as in the first example I'd rather have "Dogs, which bite." That's the way it flows for me (punctuation-foo).</p>

<p>Anyway, when I recite these two phrases, I hear their meaning. The first implies that "<i>all</i> dogs bite," and I'm talking about all dogs, while the latter implies that "<i>some</i> doges bite," and I'm just talking about those particular dogs. Then it's easy for me to use the right one, as I already know whether I'm talking about just those things that x, or about all things and all things x.</p>

<p>++ on everything you said about the importance of correct writing.</p>

<p>I come from the same state as President Bush.  I remember my fifth grade teacher, Ms. Tanner, teaching us to say "nuclear," not "nucular."  She had everyone in the class, even some particularly ditzy girls, say it properly.  It has stayed with me since then.  [Although I remember in sixth grade all the students in the fifth grade <i>enriched</i> math class saying they didn't remember fractions, so maybe I'm the only one who ever retained something he learned from year to year... sigh...]</p>

<p>I love President Bush.  He drives me nuts with "nucular."  It's embarrassing.  But I love him nonetheless.</p>

<p>So why is Bush a jackass?  Is it because his spoken grammar is poor?  Is he truly less intelligent than you or me?  Is it because he has beliefs that are different from yours?  Has he got anything of value to offer?  Have you flipped the bozo bit?</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Political thread (was Re:apples and oranges)</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gnat/">gnat</a> on 2002-09-26T16:57:51</h3>
I think Bush is a jackass because all evidence I see points toward him being a brainless puppet for the Washington insiders who form his cabinet.  He can't speak or think on his feet at all.  The man's the public face of our nation at a time when international relationships are critically important to our future, and there are thirteen year olds taking public speaking classes who can do better.<p>

The Daily Show this week had an amazing clip, where he was just plain embarrassing trying to do the "fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me" proverb.  It came out "there's a saying in Tennessee--at least, it's in Texas so it's probably in Tennessee--fool me once<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>..<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... shame on me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>..<nobr> <wbr></nobr>..<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.. fool--anyway, we can't be fooled again."  It was so obvious at the first pause that he didn't want to fuck it up, didn't trust himself not to fuck it up, and wished to hell he'd never opened his mouth.</p><p>

Oh, and I disagree with his corporate-kissass warmongering economic divide-widening politics.  It pisses me off so much I'm downloading citizenship forms now.  If I can retain my NZ citizenship, I'll naturalize just to vote against him in 2004.</p><p>

<h3><a href="/user/TorgoX/">TorgoX</a> on 2002-09-26T00:33:13</h3>
People are used to thinking about the world in terms of other people and
the things that other people do. Both grammar and thought break down
when you try to factor the people out of a situation. If your writing is
a sea of nominalizations ("requirements" instead of "you need",
"suppositions" instead of "he thinks") or passive verb-forms, you're in
trouble.

<p>Recent bad examples I saw:

</p><p> <em>"[module] is best used when a data import or export is required
but the task cannot be completed in a single pass"</em>

</p><p>or

</p><p> <em>"The use of [some SQL syntax] allows this procedure to take place
without requiring that the database and application program exchange the
data repeatedly."</em></p>

Do not spend time writing an RFC.  They already exist as The Chicago Manual of Style, The AP Style Book, The Economist Style Guide, Strunk &amp; White's Elements of Style, and so on.  Creating another resource for writers who already do not use those is a waste of energy.  You could hardly do better than those, and at best start an endless series of language flame wars.<br> <br>Besides that, each publication has their own rules and style.  No one style is the correct style.  The first principle is Consistency, and after that it is local preference.  O'Reilly has its style guide, <i>The Perl Review</i> has its style guide, and most academic journals have theirs.  A lot of trade magazines do not care too much about your writing, so they do not enforce a style.  They exist to show you ads, not to make you a better writer.<br> <br>The United States Army has an amazing style guide.  All commissioned officers take a course in writing, and it is a lot better than anything I have seen in any college course because it recognizes that every sort of writing has a different purpose and that each purpose is best achieved with a particular style. They focus on effective communication, the true purpose of all writing, rather than mechanics. The only common feature is Consistency.
