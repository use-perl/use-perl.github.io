that someone would finally get fucking tired of the same old stupid names one would expect from a sexually frustrated teenager...not from a sexually frustrated older guy. Maybe hook PIMP up with BitchX and have it create WHORE, an irc porn server.

Yes. Time to move on to a saner bare <a href="http://sam.zoy.org/projects/libcaca/" title="zoy.org">scatological trend</a zoy.org>.

Hello hfb<br> <br>Note that this name was choosed only because it is pronounceable in near all langages. I did not even know the meaning of pimp in US<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:).<br> <br>By the way, the core is independant of php, that should not be problem to use it without parot<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br> <br>pierre

<p>Well, you know, I could understand how 'gentoo' means penguin except, well, where it means whore. Fine. But, sorry, I have a really hard time believing that unless you live under a rock and have never seen any internet porn, movies, etc. that the word would be completely unfamiliar.</p>

Bah no matter. Once I knew the US meaning, I discussed it with many english people and none of them see a problem. As it will be used mainly in the context of graphics programming and php (or other).<br/><br/>Anyway, the main thing is the lib itself no its name<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br/><br/>pierre

It's just such a cliche, so worn and tired, I simply find it irritating and juvenile. It's funny in Austin Powers movies, not so much so in something that is supposed to be trying to give women the idea that software isn't a teenage boys club.
