<p>Oh boy, what a trip.  Two kids does not a happy flight make.  We survived it, though, mostly thanks to the good fortune of travel agent cockups landing  my parents on the same flight as us.<p>

The kids are now adjusting better than we are.  Raley slept most of last night, and William slept all of it.  We passed out in the afternoon and slept again at night.  The day started at 6am yesterday, and I'm picking tomorrow will do the same.<p>

I've started writing my novel, but I'm struggling with the plotting.  I've reached ch10 in the outline, but I think I need a few more investigative threads going at once to be able to proceed further.  Hey, in writing this I just thought of a new thread ... progress!<p>

Dinner tonight was a delicious seafood pasta.  The seafood in question was <a href="http://tsuribaka-fishing.co.nz/bait/pipi/">pipi</A> (link not for the faint of heart).  Unlike previous trips, we didn't dig these pipi from the harbour.  They were for sale at the supermarket--$3/kilo.  SLURP!<p>

We ordered a half a lamb today.  I'm a bit nervous that we won't have a chance of finishing it all by the time we leave--we'll need to start making friends and throwing parties.  It's incredibly cheaper here than in the US.  The same is true for most household items (food, paper towels, etc.).  The exception is diapers, so we brought a heap with us.  A lot.  A <b>wall</b> of diapers.  Three suitcases full ....<p>

Editing on the next book proceeds apace.  I hope to have a finished chapter to send back to the author for his comments.  This is much easier than the PHP book!<p>
