<h1>Review: A Twist at the End, by Steven Saylor</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>I love <a href="http://www.stevensaylor.com/">Steven Saylor</a>'s books.  He's written a series of mysteries set          
in ancient Rome (the Roma Sub Rosa series) which I've eagerly                  
devoured.  "A Twist at the End", however, represents quite a large             
departure.  Far from the politics of the Roman senate, this mystery is         
set in Austin, Texas, in 1885.  The protagonist is O. Henry. <p>                  
                                                                               
That premise alone hooked me.  It was enough to get me through the             
cowboy talk that populates the Wild West.  Actually, Saylor seems able         
to put in only enough "Oh, Mama!"isms to remind you that this <i>is</i> the         
Wild West, but not so many that you need to pause and think "what the          
hell did <i>that</i> mean?"  Normally the dialogue is what puts me off              
historical fiction, but I survived this book unscathed.  <p>                      
                                                                               
The book is long (you get 561 pages for your $7.50) and the story is           
elongated.  Saylor based it around an actual set of murders in Austin          
in the time that O. Henry (whose real name was Will Porter) was                
working there.  It's interesting that Saylor specifically doesn't
try for an O. Henry-like turnaround at the end of the novel--you know          
for most of the book who the murderer was, and instead Saylor milks            
the drama from the characters and not knowing what's bringing Will             
Porter back to Austin after 20 years.                                          <p>
                                                                               
In short, a good read but long--it took me about four hours of solid           
reading.  It wasn't as enjoyable for me as the Roma Sub Rosa series            
because I didn't enjoy the world of 1885 Austin as much as the world           
of Rome in the first century B.C, but it sure beat the in-flight               
magazine :-) <p>                                                                  
                                                                               
Ranking: 7.5/10. <p>
