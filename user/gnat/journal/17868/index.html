<p>I've been waiting for ages for a prepackaged build of Mono for OS X that didn't involve the plague of Fink.  I finally gave up and built one, with the able help of Brian Jepson.  The result is <a href="http://nathan.torkington.com/mac/monocore-0.30.2.dmg">here</a>, a DMG of a package that gives you <i>/usr/local/mono</i>.  Enjoy!<p>

Care to explain what the plague of fink is?

That only takes me to fink's SourceForge site. They don't describe themselves as a plague.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

It believes that you can beat DLL hell with sufficiently advanced tools.  All I ever ended up with was a system for installing <i>binary</i> forms of that "A requires L 1.0, B requires L 2.0, installing one borks the other" misery, which meant I became miserable sooner but didn't actually remove the source of the misery.<p>

Now I build things in their own directories.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><i>/usr/local/ethereal</i> will have all the shared libraries needed to run ethereal, and if Mono ever requires a different version of the library then nothing will break because mono is in<nobr> <wbr></nobr><i>/usr/local/mono<i>.</i></i></p><p><i><i>

&gt; It believes that you can beat DLL hell with sufficiently advanced tools.<br> <br>Yeah.  I really wanted Fink (or something with similar promises) to work, so I have given it a try.  Three times by now, I think.  Every time I have ended up with some seriously hosed software setups.  That is, for the software that I did get installed at all.  It sucketh overmuch.  Nevermore.<br> <br>I've lost all hope of any binary-only open source distribution systems ever working, incidentally.  Just give me the source, man.

care to explain what mono is, and why i should be excited about this?  Yes, I know it's some gnu-ish clone of<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.net, but what can one *do* with it?

Mono's a virtual machine plus compilers (C# and Visual Basic for<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET), as well as ASP.NET (mod_perl/PHP type deal), and reimplementations of a lot of the Microsoft runtime libraries.  It lets you<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... write programs<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... do<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... stuff.<p>

People whose opinions I respect <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2004/03/11/mono.html" title="onlamp.com">have said</a onlamp.com> that C# is much more fun to develop in than C for the types of programs that Unix folks typically write in C (network, file, GUI) and is about as fast.  That sounds like an interesting claim, so I've been meaning to check it out.</p><p>

<i>Almost everything is more fun to develop in than C.</i> <br> <br>That's a question of mindset. For people with a lot of hubris, C is the perfect language. It always gives me a good feeling to know that each C statement is translated into a few machine instructions and will never do more than I actually asked for.<br> <br>At the same time (and that makes C so cool), it's a language leading to relatively compact source code. You'd expect to be ending up writing a lot of code as the language is rather spartan, but often you don't.<br> <br> <i>That includes Java, barely, but not C++</i> <br> <br>Turn that around. Java for me is a synonym for boredom. C++ on the other hand is one of those languages that packed every available feature into the language (a bit like Perl) and therefore has its own flavor of TIMTOWTDY, including a thousand ways to shoot yourself in the foot. And that's a good thing, IMHO.
