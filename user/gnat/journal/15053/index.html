<p>I did it.  Thanks to Amazon's uber-discounts, I have a Nokia 3650.  All the cool kids had them at the Usenix Security Symposium, so I figured I should too.  <a href="http://raelity.org/">Rael</a> and <a href="http://www.x180.net/">James</a> were frothing about how great they are, and that pushed me over the edge.<p>

This phone is very cool.  The camera takes <a href="http://nathan.torkington.com/tmp/raley.jpg">pretty good pictures</a>, it's very audible, the speakerphone option is nifty, and it's very cool to be able to email photos and audio recordings from the phone to my family.  The only thing I've found I don't like so far is the design of the menus and applications--the features of the phone are spread out in weird locations.  For example, when looking at an image I can email to someone, but I can't set it as the background--for that I need to run another program and dig about four levels deep in menus!<p>

In fact, almost everything seems harder than it should be.  The User Guide that came with the phone is utterly awful--poorly ordered and fails to answer the questions I have.  I've started documenting the things I figured out to do <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3840">in my O'Reilly Network blog</a>.  They may be totally lame ("duh, that took me only a minute to figure out") but I figure <i>someone</i> can learn from my mistakes :-)<p>

When I'm at the editors meeting next week, I'm going to pick the brains of all the Java guys and have them give me a quick tutorial in how to write programs for this puppy.  Whee!<p>

<h2>Does it have Bluetooth?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jbodoni/">jbodoni</a> on 2003-10-03T21:30:09</h3>
If so, then you've got a whole new category of toys to spend money on.<p>My carrier (Cingular) just started offering Bluetooth-capable phones in my region recently, so I jumped and got a Siemens S56.  After some initial pain (see my journal for details), I managed to get my iBook and phone talking to each other.</p><p>Syncing the phone and 'book over Bluetooth is oh-so-nice without wires.  Surfing the web without wi-fi is slow, but beats having no access at all.</p><p>I also caved in and bought a Bluetooth headset, which also rocks.</p><p>John</p>

Yup, it has Bluetooth.  I'm steadfastly avoiding buying any more toys beyond the USB Bluetooth dongle.  I have long pockets and short arms<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

<a href="http://www.raelity.org/" title="raelity.org">Rael</a raelity.org> showed me how to get the wireless modemmy stuff working.  Happy me.  Happy happy me.</p><p>

You found the new Bluetooth icon in the address book, right?<p>John</p>
