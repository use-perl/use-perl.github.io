<div class="span8">
<p>The big story in NZ is the kidnapping of an 8 mo girl.  The story as known so far:
<ul>
<li>Girl is adopted daughter.
<li>Two parents are Eddie Durie (High Court judge) and Donna Hall (prominent Maori lawyer).
<li>Both were heavily involved with pro-Maori legal action.
<li>Durie chairs the Waitangi Tribunal, which decides the fate of Maori restitution claims.  (Many went in favour of Maori)
<li>Hall worked on such claims, some successful.
<li>Hall was made the National Business Review rich list, which suggested she was worth $10M.
<li>Maori activists seem to be happy with Hall and Durie.
<li>Hall, Durie, and their daughter are all Maori.
<li>At 11:30am yesterday a slim Caucasian in late 30s to early 40s, either balding or with closely cropped greying hair, wearing black jeans and a jacket, approached Hall who was pushing her daughter in a strolle accompanied by two neices.
<li>He said something to Hall, but there appears to be some doubt about what he said.
<li>The getaway car, a two-tone Mitsubishi Galant, had plates that had been stolen 2 years before.
<li>Because of the stolen plates and gun, it's being treated as a planned abduction.
<li>There has been no contact from the abductor.
</ul>

Is it a White is Right nutter?  Urban Maori were excluded from the lucrative fisheries settlement--perhaps an urban activist.  Then again, it could have been an opportunistic grab, and the abductor was very unlucky to have kidnapped the child of a prominent couple.  Is it the original family of the adopted daughter?<p>

To make things juicier, on the same day there was a murder ("garotted or knifed") in the same part of town.<p>

What is Maori?

Google would have told you<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  Indigenous race of New Zealand, akin to the Native Americans.  They're in a much better position now, though, than the Native Americans.<p>

I did look at Google, but from the few sites I looked at, I guessed that they were an indigenous people, but didn't understand their significance.  Comparing them to Native Americans gives me enough context, though, I think.  Even though I'd say we did nothing wrong, ever, to Native Americans, because AMERICA IS PERFECT!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
