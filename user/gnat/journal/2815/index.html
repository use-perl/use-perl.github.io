<p>Do not put regular soap liquid in the dishwasher.  One sudso floor later and wife is mocking me hard about it.  Apparently it's a Classic Guy Mistake.  D'oh.<p>

<p>usually has, in big letters, USE ONLY DISHWASHER DETERGENT on it...if she mocks you it's because you deserve it for not RTFI<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Don't put Baking Soda in the washing machine.  Yikes.
<br>
<br>Jeremy Clarkson did it on television in the UK to demonstrate methods of escaping chores.  It ended up with the front door of the washing machine blowing across the studio and into the audience.  Not a mistake you would make twice methinks.



<h2>Photos?</h2>

I had always threatened my parents with doing that, just to see how it looked.  I really am curious as to how much suds it produces; did you get any snapshots?

She did take a photo.  She's about 6 weeks behind in uploading photos, though, so don't expect them to go onto the web any time soon<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(<p>

(imagine our kitchen floor covered in suds and a
cm of water with the dishwasher looking like Old Man Winter with a long beard of suds)</p>

Over the holidays when we were vactioning one
<br>of the other people we were staying with did this.
<br>
<br>His defense was that he said he'd asked and someone said it was the right stuff to use.

I did that this summer. I'd never done dishes in a dishwasher, my parents being the "chores build character" types.  First time living on my own, and I finally had to dishes. So I was determined to have technology do it for me. Load the dishwasher up, put in the soap, go watch cable.
<p>About thirty minutes pass, and I start hearing gurgling noises. I wander over to find the kitchen floor completely covered in soap suds. I have noone to call, so I call the apartment staff. Explain situation. The operator on the other end of the phone is completely surprised. He says "Excuse me for a moment," sets down the phone, and starts laughing hysterically. This continues for about a minute, and then he explains how to solve the problem.
</p><p>Lesson learned.</p>

So, err, how <em>did</em> you solve the problem?

Get out what suds you can.  Remove the dishes and rinse them by hand.  Remove the racks and rinse those too.
<br>
<br>Take about half a gallon of vinegar and put it in the dishwasher and run it.  The vinegar will cut the suds and let you flush out the pump, sprayers, etc..

Whoops. I also forgot to mention, epsom salts will work as well.  But there's a danger they won't fully dissolve in the rinse.
<br>
<br>Dishwashing tip: make a trip to the grocery store and get a bottle of "Tang" powder (instant orange drink).  Run a cup through the empty dishwasher as if it were dish soap.  Cleans out the works and leaves everything smelling *nice*.

Table salt. Most of one of those Morton's blue containers got dumped into the machine, then I ran the thing without detergent twice to clean it out.
<p>Sorry for the lagtime.</p>
