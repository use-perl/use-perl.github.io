<h2>*should* be reading?</h2>

<p>Mmm. Pudge and I have talked about this offline. Promoting blogging or blog consumption to a daily TODO item can lead to madness. Personally, I run through my "friends" list on use.perl.org, <a href="http://noopy.org/" title="noopy.org">NVP</a noopy.org>, <a href="http://axisofaevil.hietaniemi.org/hfb/" title="hietaniemi.org">HFB</a hietaniemi.org> and <a href="http://www.jmac.org/" title="jmac.org">Jmac</a jmac.org>. I also will check out blogs of people who comment on blogs (oddly enough). It seems like there is an interesting excerise in data mining in watching blogs, although I can't quite formulate what that excerise would be. Monitoring productivity loss in the work place, maybe?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

RSS Aggregators can make this easier for you--you get one page with links to all the latest news.  Not that I use one, of course.  A while ago I was spending two or three hours reading blogs a day, and that was just insane.  Of course, I could claim it was research for the Essential Blogging book<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

I have a handful of non-use.perl blogs that I read.  I'm just wondering whether I'm missing good stuff.</p><p>

As for datamining, I really want to gather a hundred peoples' bookmarks files and use clustering to see if I can easily spot an OS X weenie vs a closet Java programmer etc.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  The interesting blog mining is done by <a href="http://blogdex.media.mit.edu/" title="mit.edu">blogdex</a mit.edu> and <a href="http://www.daypop.com/top/" title="daypop.com">the daypop top 40</a daypop.com>.</p><p>

I read a whole bunch of journals here, mostly to see what perl people are doing and see what my friends have to say here.  Oh, and I check out the oreillynet blogs pretty regularly too.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
For non-useperl blogs, I look for something that's interesting that contains news/links I won't find anywhere else.  I've gotten into lisp recently, so I'm reading <a href="http://www.lemonodor.com/" title="lemonodor.com">lemonodor</a lemonodor.com>, <a href="http://lambda.weblogs.com/" title="weblogs.com">Lambda the Ultimate</a weblogs.com> daily, and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/" title="paulgraham.com">Paul Graham's homepage</a paulgraham.com> whenever he has something new to say.  Perhaps if I could find a few smalltalk blogs, I'd monitor them as well (just never got around to looking mostly).
</p><p>
I'm not particularly interested in the general <a href="http://www.scripting.com/" title="scripting.com">look at me</a scripting.com>, <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/" title="weblogs.com">I'm so fabulous</a weblogs.com> type blogs.  Sure, they're a great trove of links and topics, but that's not something I want to integrate into my daily reading regimen.  More of an interesting distraction than something I want to track regularly.</p>

You should all read my journal and post comments so I feel loved<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>Friends List</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vek/">vek</a> on 2002-07-13T07:38:09</h3>
I see you've already got a couple of these on your friends list but I'll list mine anyway - all highly recommeded BTW:<br> <br>gav, gnat, ziggy, davorg, chromatic, acme, dbjerg96, jjohn, autarch, chaoticset, TorgoX, Purdy, Matts, james, ovid, pudge, simon (moved on), darobin, 2shortplanks, pne, larson, hfb (moved on).<br> <br>Based on comments to a recent <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Matts/journal/6274" title="perl.org">Matts</a perl.org> journal it would seem that others think it far too much effort to visit non use.perl.org blogs.  I really don't understand what all the whining is about.  I mean how hard is it to bookmark the "foreign" blog you want to read?  I have 9 non use.perl.org blogs that I view on my lunchbreak.  They're all bookmarked so I just click, visit, read.  It must take me, oh I don't know, a whole <b>minute</b> to "check" to see if those blogs have any new posts<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

It's too much effort since I use journal-to-mail to screenscrape use.perl.org and email me the journals whenever one of my 'friends'[1] posts a journal.
<p>
[1] Oh, this also explains why my friends list doesn't have half the people's journals I read on it.</p>

I have 300K of bookmarks in my profile.
They organized and things still get lost.
It actually takes a lot of time to "check",
I have realized this greatly since I created and started using <a href="http://pthbb.org/manual/software/pnews/" title="pthbb.org">le pnews</a pthbb.org>

<h3><a href="/user/barbie/">barbie</a> on 2002-07-16T21:45:54</h3>
The two I probably enjoy reading most are 2shortplanks &amp; richardc. Mainly because they nearly always reference modules and stuff I really feel I ought to take a look at. Don't always get the time to, but I do like new toys every now and then.
<p>
Of the others I read most, well they're already in your list<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>

Why not just check <a href="http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=top" title="perl.org">this page</a perl.org> regularly?<br> <p>You are already friends with most of the heavy posters.  A peek at what the others are saying might be a good way to make new friends.<br> </p><p>
