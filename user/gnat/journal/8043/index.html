<p>then why does the US need its approval at all? I suppose if life were a sitcom this simplistic analysis would suffice but the US thinks far too much of itself and may find out the hard way that there won't be a happy ending to this story. Imagine what 200 billion could do for education in the US to offer hope of brains over bombs in the future. And a generation of writers who could think of something above an 8th grade sitcom level analysis of world politics.</p>

</p><p>UR words make me angry! U R a bad bad person. I love the US and George Bush 4EVR! Saddham INSANE is a crazy ROGUE NATION, like HITLER. Those WHINERS in the UN should stay out of the kitchen if they can take the heat of true leadership. What other nation has the moral strength and broad vision to guild the international community? Besides, those women on The View say SODOM Hussein is Al-Queda. I suppose you want to see more planes crash into buildings!

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/04/weekinreview/04WORD.html" title="nytimes.com">This article</a nytimes.com> references a paper with the intriguing title "Biological Warfare and the Buffy Paradigm".<p>Amusingly (to me, anyway) I saw a printout of it hanging on a bulletin board in a Federal office building. (I would tell you which branch, but the Secret Service might take away my clearance.)</p><p>

<h2>I like this article a lot...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/2shortplanks/">2shortplanks</a> on 2002-09-27T10:40:43</h3>
...it sums up one of the big problems with America.
<p>
You see, Buffy is the chosen one.  To each generation, one is born...blah blah blah blah.
</p><p>
I love the way the article assumes that the USA <em>is</em> the chosen one.  It alone can stand up against the darkness, and therefore is justified in doing whatever it wants.  It doesn't need the aproval of the UN because it is <em>special</em>.  Yeah, right.  Maybe the US should play by the same rules it expects everyone else to play by<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
</p><p>
Is this the same logic that means that US Nationals should be <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/web/icc_petition.nsf" title="amnesty.org">excempt</a amnesty.org> from the International Criminal Court? I'm not saying the UK is any different and we don't have our own flaws, or that America is wrong in it's actions, but it has to think about <em>why</em> it is doing it rather than going off on some sort of crusade.
</p><p>
Buffy?  Nah, it's being a bit more like Faith atm.</p>



<h2>Foreign Policy In Focus</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jhi/">jhi</a> on 2002-09-27T15:00:39</h3>
<a href="http://www.foreignpolicy-infocus.org/" title="foreignpol...nfocus.org">This</a foreignpol...nfocus.org> is a collection of various writings showing light on  the darker side of current American policies.  No doubt some people will slam the writings as left-leaning liberal spineless unpatriotic drivel, but that only makes it so much more interesting.

<h2>Chomskyn artikkeleita</h2>

Related to this, I always find <a href="http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/" title="zmag.org">Noam Chomsky publications</a zmag.org> very interesting. He's one of the few people that makes you feel more intelligent when you read him, because, even when you disagree with his opinions, he forces you to ask yourself why, and to exercise criticism. (And that's true both for his political writings and his papers on linguistics).

<h2>Oz</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vsergu/">vsergu</a> on 2002-09-27T20:58:32</h3>
Bringing in an Oz analogy in the last paragraph muddled the commentary a bit, especially for people familiar with "Buffy" characters.

<i> Bringing in an Oz analogy in the last paragraph muddled the commentary a bit, especially for people familiar with "Buffy" characters.</i> <br> <br>No, only for people not familiar with the Oz characters.<br> <br>(If you're trying to equate those two sets of people, I think you're confused.)<br> <br>Anyway, Oz is a standard metaphor, in the 20th century, for someone thought to have power who is exposed as having none.<br> <br> <b> <i>Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!</i> </b> <br>

My point was that Oz was the name of a regular character on "Buffy", so those familiar with the series will be the ones susceptible to confusion.  Those (like you, apparently) who have never heard of Oz the "Buffy" character won't have a problem.
