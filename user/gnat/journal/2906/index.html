<p>Not much.  You?<p>

We went to a taping of <a href="http://www.notmuch.com/">this radio show</a> tonight, and had a blast.  It's much funnier in real life than on the radio--possibly because you get a lot more of his jokes because they're local. <p>

He ripped on Greeley (the town hosting the show) for its feed lots and smell, and almost picked Jenine to play the quiz (I <i>told</i> her to flash him!).  Someone won a shitload of rocky mountain oysters (bull balls), and another guy won 150 pounds of potatoes.  It's a tossup which one I'd want least :-)<p>

If you ever get the chance to go see a radio show be taped, do it.  We also saw an e-town taping last year, and it was a totally different experience.  Lots of sound level checking on e-town (they edit and do a lot of post-production) whereas Whad'ya Know was very spontaneous and free-flowing, as befits a live show.<p>

Oh, and someone was giving out books afterward.  I now have a new paperback thriller to read on the plane.  Hopefully it won't turn out to be some dreary Christian shit.  Hmm, there's an idea for a business--writing novels that incorporate agendas.  The novels can be handed out as freebies, subtly exposing the twelve people in America who can read to the agenda of a corporation or religious group.<p>

If editing books with cute animals falls through, it's good to know I can come up with stupid business ideas that will probably sound good to a venture capitalist.  Shame that petfood online has been done ...<p>

<p>I've been to recording's of the UK's Just A Minute and I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue (possibly the best radio comedy every).  They're disturbingly like meeting people you've known from IRC, names start to get faces and disembodied voices become cumbersome bags of flesh.  I like that.</p>

If I'd go to a radio show taping, it'd have to be <a href="http://phc.mpr.org/" title="mpr.org">A Prairie Home Companion</a mpr.org>.

I've lived here in Minneapolis (about 15 minutes from where its taped) for about 6 years and I still haven't made it to a taping of that show, which I actually like.  Maybe next time my parents visit that will be the incentive to get tickets.

Heh, Michael Feldman (the host of Whad'ya Know) said (jokingly) "you can get up and go to the bathroom or whatever during the show, not like a certain other mid-Western radio show I could name<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...".  I get the feeling PHC is a little more fascist than Whad'ya Know.  It sure would be fun, though.  The music was so much better live than when you hear it on the radio, it might even save GK's singing<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

Yeah, he's not exactly Mel Torme, but then again, Mel Torme isn't very funny.
