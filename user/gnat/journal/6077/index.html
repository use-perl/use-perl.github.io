<p>After the Thursday sessions, Damian, Jon, Allison, Casey, and myself went back to Casey's room to do some improv.  "Whose Code is it Anyway" is based on "Whose Line is it Anyway", only Larry Wall and Perl 6 are referenced more often in the situations that we must improvise around.<p>

This session was making sure we had the hang of the games.  It's hard to improvise, much less around strange rules like "each line of dialogue must start with the next letter of the alphabet", or "each line must be a question".  We got into the groove after a while, though, and kept playing in Casey's (sweet) car en route to Brent Michalski's bbq.<p>

Brent has a <i>huge</i> yard, with ample space for dozens of #perl and YAPC folks.  He was a great host, bbqing burgers, dogs, and some awesome seasoned steaks provided by freeside (Meng Wong).  I believe more shout outs have to go to freeside and Uri as assistant grillmasters.<p>

Joe Johnston (jjohn), Schuyler Erle, Chris Nandor (pudge), Mark-Jason Dominus, and others rocked out on guitars and bass.  I brought my banjo, but had trouble keeping up with some of the rock songs.  When they were in a lull, though, I had great fun playing banjo while someonewhosenameIforget (shame) played awesome bass behind bluegrass and jazz stuff.<p>

It was over all too soon--Damian and Casey had to get back and prepare their Friday talks, and I was very sleepy.  It was a night that I wanted to last longer.  Everyone who was there is grateful to Brent and his family for being gracious hosts (with the exception of Brent's punchy daughter who kept hustling geeks out of her living room saying "geek free zone, real people only!").<p>

I enjoyed rocking out with you and MJD hollowing lyrics like a man possessed. One of these days, we'll have a set list and THEN the world will know the fury that can be unleased by acoustic instruments!
