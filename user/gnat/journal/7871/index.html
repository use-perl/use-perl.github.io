<p>I bought my tickets to Mac OS X Con on cheaptickets.com, and then Jenine pointed out that I'd be away for Raley's birthday.  D'oh.  No problem, brace my ass for a reaming and call cheaptickets to change the tickets.<p>

Ha!<p>

Cheaptickets never answer their phones.  Frontier, the airline I'm flying, won't change the flights for me, but want me to go through Cheaptickets.  Who don't answer their phones.<p>

I spent a half-hour trying every option, scouring the web site for alternate locations to call, and gave up when I felt like my chest was going to explode from stress.  I'm missing my daughter's first birthday because I can't change my ticket, which is not an unreasonable nor uncommon request.  So we're organizing a birthday party on another week, but ... gah!<p>

Ugh, my blood pressure rose just writing this.  I should have used the local travel agent.  My sister spent three days trying to find a good price for flights to China in November, and couldn't get much below $1000.  Three minutes on the phone with the local Aggie Travel (that's its name, folks!  I am not making this up) and she had a price $300 better.  When will I learn that the Internet sucks for commerce?<p>

<h2>Eat the ticket...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jweveland/">jweveland</a> on 2002-09-20T20:37:21</h3>
... and call it a lesson learned?  If it were me, I could stomach eating the ticket more easily than missing my son's first birthday.  YMMV as always.<br> <br>jweveland



<h2>Ticket, ticket, what is `ticket'?</h2>

<p>Should have used priceline, 'cause they've got that supercomputer.</p>
<p>And they've got Shatner ready at hand to start confuzzling it with illogic and make smoke come out of its ears if it gets out of hand.</p>

<p>Or something.</p>
