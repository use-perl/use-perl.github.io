<p>As belg4mit reminded me, you should buy "Salmon of a Doubt".  Its title should be "what we found on his hard drive after he died" (but it's still a very entertaining book) but because it will support the family and memory of a fucking brilliant person.<p>

I'm only halfway through it, and it's like crack.  I started reading it while I was rocky Raley to sleep, and couldn't put it down.  It's a ridiculous comparison, but I feel like a Beatles fan after Lennon was shot.  I keep thinking "he could have given us so much more!"<p>

I only exchanged a few email messages with Adams, to my lasting regret.  So buy the book, support his family, and remember him.<p>

(Yes, how your family will do after you die does become rather a large issue once you have a family)<p>

<h2>Could've Been Worse</h2>

Nigel D. Findley wrote scads of RPG supplements and some fiction based in the same RPG worlds.  I read quite a bit of the stuff he put out; much of the reason I wanted to be a writer was because I had read his work.
<p>
I found his email address the day after he died.</p>
