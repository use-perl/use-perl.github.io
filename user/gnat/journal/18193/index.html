<p>Notes on <a href="http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/comp/Publications/CS-TR-02-11.abs.html">a paper by a professor of mine</a>:
<ul>
<li><i>orientational metaphors</i> rely on up/down or left/right.  E.g., wizards where "next" is always on the right, and "back" on the left, and scrollbars where "more" is up.
<li><i>ontological metaphors</i> treat things in the computer as objects or substances, but not specific objects or substances.  Files have sizes, errors "prevent" the system from doing something.
<li><i>structural metaphors</i> treat the computer concepts as real objects.  E.g., filesystem as filing cabinet with folders that "contain" files.
<li><i>conventional metaphors</i> are those used without thinking (e.g., all those above).   <i>Novel metaphors</i> are those that are perceived by the user.
<li><i>metonymy</i> is substituting a part for the whole, as in  showing a person's face in a chat, or paintbrush icons for the mass colouring operation.
<li>the authors add <i>process</i> and <i>element</i> metaphors as categories.  You use an element metaphor (paintbrush) to clue the user into what process metaphor (colouring big chunks of pixels as though by painting) is active.
<li><i>metaphoric entailments</i> are the implications/limitations of the metaphor.  E.g. the desktop filing metaphor includes "we have files and folders" but in real life, a file is typically a folder of pages but that is not part of the desktop metaphor.
<li>Rule 1: <b>know the entailments of your conventional metaphors</b> so you can indicate any standard entailments that do not apply
<li>Rule 2: <b>with novel metaphors, you have to spell out all the entailments</b> because users will not know what to do with your innovative "office workflow as camel's digestive system" metaphor
<li>Rule 3: <b>use as many entailments as possible</b> (though all should be justified in terms of functionality), because the more they can successfully follow their knowledge of the metaphor, the more they'll trust it
<li>Rule 4: <b>orientational concepts structure multiple members of a group, so consider the implications</b>: if you say good is up and put error messages on the bottom, you have to put success messages at the top.  What's a success message?
<li>Rule 5: <b>use as few process metaphors as possible</b>--a lot of process metaphors give a lot of entailments, and the user is overwhelmed.  Minimize the number of process metaphors, and maximize their coverage.
<li>Rule 6: <b>base every element metaphor on a process metaphor</b> so if your process is budgeting software then the user shouldn't see icons from the world of sport
<li>Rule 7: <b>understand the user's metaphoric world</b>.  Yes, Apple, on what bloody planet does the trash can turn into a CD burner?  not this user's, that's for sure!

<p>I wonder, is this UI convention reversed in places which write from right to left?  If it isn't, should it be?</p>
