<p>Whee, two copies of <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/tpj1/">Computer Science &amp; Perl Programming: Best of the Perl Journal Volume 1</a> arrived in the mail today.  Authors should get theirs next week, I think, and they should be available in stores in two or three weeks as books make their way through the warehouses and supply chains.<p>

Wow.  It's big.  And beautiful.  It's really cool to see so many articles I remember.  And they're still good today.  I am, of course, not impartial (two of my articles open the book!) but hey, impartiality is overrated.  It's got me itching for the next volumes.<p>

Mark-Jason Dominus wrote a hilarious foreword.  Jon's got a great history of TPJ.  It's all good, baby.  I can think of a number of coworkers just getting their feet in Perl who should have read this.  I'd have given it to them and said "master all this and you are ready to touch my code".<p>

And the feeling of nostalgia ...  Aaah.<p>

Bookpool, the new love of my life have it for the bargain price of <a href="http://www.bookpool.com/.x/swdfd676x1/sm/0596003102" title="bookpool.com"> $24.95</a bookpool.com>!
<p>
My books-to-buy / books-not-read pile is outgrowing my ability to read at the moment. Damn ORA going and releasing all these titles!</p>



<h2>Got mine already!</h2>

<p>Indeed O-dawg gets mad props for many things, but seeing those articles bound in an ORA book lends added credibility to those wonderful articles. All of them are worth a read. In fact, I was just leafing through the Cozens article on microperl. I had plum forgotten it! I'm sure I'll have many more moments like that. It's like looking at baby pictures.</p>



<h2>Updated?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/yudel/">yudel</a> on 2002-11-10T00:54:03</h3>
Have any of the articles been updated for this anthology? Are any of the original illustrations / covers included?
<p>
TPJ covers were the best thing since the original Bytes.</p>

I can't speak for this volume, but I've got an article in the 2nd (IMSMR; the Web one) volume and I  did <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Fletch/journal/3348" title="perl.org">go over</a perl.org> mine and at least made sure things still ran with current versions of the modules (and it surprisingly did<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:).

No covers, but all authors were given the chance to review and update their articles.<p>

Mine showed up on the doorstep friday, much to my surprise. It was a cool little present.
