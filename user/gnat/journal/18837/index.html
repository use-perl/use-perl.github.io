<p>Excellent movie!  One of the most fun trips to the movie theatre I've made in a while.  I particularly enjoyed Jennifer Saunders's singing as the Fairy Godmother.  It's the first movie that my 2.5 year old daughter has stayed through in the theatre, though we should have timed it for <i>other</i> than naptime for maximum results.<p>

<h2>Shrek 2 -- Counterpoint</h2>

<p>I <em>hate</em> that movie!  Of course, I haven't actually seen the thing.  Unfortunately, it's the widest studio release in the history of cinema (over 4,000 theaters in the US) and the hoops we've had to jump through here at work to ensure that the flood of data is handled appropriately has caused plenty of headaches.  So much for deadlines<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I'm still neutral-- haven't seen it yet, but we've had a few hoops to navigate as well, in supporting our IVR application for Fandango.com. Still, this wasn't nearly the hassle that we had in December, when <i> <b>all three</b> </i> LoTR installments were in theaters in some areas, and we had to have speech-recognition grammars that could handle then all at once...</p>

<p>Ooh<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... sounds like you had some of the same fun we had.  We had to deal with messes like that, too.  Getting data from thousands of theaters, all of them giving subtly different names to the movies makes life, er, interesting.  We mostly get things right, but we organic AI systems (i.e., people) sitting at computers doing manual title matching.  Lots of fun, I tell you.</p>

<p>Interestingly, we've tried voice recognition systems, too, so that theaters could call in their grosses.  This is what is technically referred to as "one big bucket of suck."</p>

I disliked the first Shrek, and therefore have no plans to see the second.  I thought the animation was dull, the characters were boring, the humor was forced and weak.  The acting was good, and it was technically excellent, even if I didn't enjoy looking at it.<br> <br>I know it is heresey to say all that, but whatever.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>Agreed!</h2>

Good movie and just as good as the first, which is odd for a sequel nowadays.  My 11-year old and I enjoyed it immensely.
