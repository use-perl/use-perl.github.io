<p>The result of my afternoon's labour: <a href="http://prometheus.frii.com/user/gnat/tmp/grid.html">a grid showing OSCON at a glance</a>.  You might want to buy an enormous monitor and drop the point size to get it in only one glance, 'cos there's a lot going on.<p>

I see that perl slowly takes over the conference as the days progress.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

That wasn't totally deliberate.  I began with two rooms for three days for Perl, but realized that putting anybody against Damian and Larry and Jarkko and lightning talks is a Big Mistake.  So I moved Wednesday's room-day to Friday.<p>

And there'll be more Perl stuff (RT, Movable Type, Gerald Richter) coming.  I've also got a linguist, Allison Randal, to talk about tagmemics (so maybe we'll all stand a chance of understanding Larry<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).  This stuff will be announced early next week.  I was building the grid view so I could see how much spare room I had<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>

Now all I need to do is clone myself so I can get to the Mono talks at the same time as everything else..

<h2>Playstations?</h2>

<i>Developing Game Logic: Python on the Sony Playstation 2 and Nintendo GameCube</i>
<p>
Dammit, now the Python folks are gonna leverage this against the Perl community because *we* don't have anything like this.  I can hear the "nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah" repeating in my head now.
</p><p>
Quick, someone write the "Games::Console::Playstation2" and "Games::Console::GameCube" modules before they can start giving us any grief.</p>

I'm working on getting two presentations from people in the movie computer graphics industry.  Both are heavy (HEAVY) Perl consumers, despite this industry being allegedly Python-tight.<p>

But yes, it'd be cool to have Perl bindings to the Linux Playstation libraries<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p><p>

<h2>More computer readable format</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/2shortplanks/">2shortplanks</a> on 2002-05-11T08:55:52</h3>
Any chance you could give us a copy of the data in a more computer readable format?
<p>
Last year we wrote a CGI RSS feed for dispy (which purl ended up using as well) so that you could ask the bot who was speaking currently and next.</p>



<h2>Up to Date?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mako132/">mako132</a> on 2002-07-02T15:55:09</h3>
Are you keeping this up to date?  I mean, can I book mark this, or should I just refer to the O'Reilly site for accurate info?
