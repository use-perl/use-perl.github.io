I've captured from The Daily Show the clip of W struggling to say "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me." Notice the look of abject fear as he realizes that he's going to muff it and it's going to end up on the news, and on damn fool weblogs.

<h2>I like it</h2>

<p>Would have liked seeing the part where he says it's from (Texas|Tennessee|whatever).</p>

<p>I still like that guy!</p>



<h2>And?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2002-09-27T21:21:25</h3>
<p>
I'd be a lot more wary of any public figure who didn't trip up, occasionally,  during an extemporaneous speech.  I'd hate to be on tape continually!

*occasionally*?

Yeah, if it was occasional then that'd be cool.  Clinton goofed occasionally.  Bush's gaffes are frequent and often <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A56556-2002Apr15&amp;notFound=true" title="washingtonpost.com">edited out</a washingtonpost.com> of the public record, despite <a href="http://politicalhumor.about.com/cs/bushspeak/" title="about.com">being immortalized wherever possible</a about.com>.  The only reason you think it's occasional is that most of his malapropisms aren't widely reported, or aren't commented on.<p>

<p>
Their apparent absence proves their frequency?
</p>
<p>
I know you're not a big fan of the Bush administration's policies, and that's fine.  It just seems pretty lazy to criticize the guy for getting tongue-tied.  Maybe he's a lousy speaker, and that's fine by me too.  My point is that there are plenty of people, friend and foe, ready to pounce on every word he says.
</p>
<p>If I were on the record that much, you'd have plenty of reasons to call me a knob, too.  (Of course, I don't trust anyone to set a nuclear policy who says <em>nucular</em>.  You've got me there.)</p>
