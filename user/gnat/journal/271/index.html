<p>As our <A HREF="http://www.yapc.org/America/">YAPC</A> trip to Montreal grows closer, we're getting more and more excited.  I'm writing slides for my talks, and Jenine's finding web sites with lots of stuff for us to do.<P><br/><br/>I originally signed up to do 25 minutes of talks--a 20 minute talk on P2P and Web Services, and a 5 minute lightning talk comparing languages.  But I also said I could do more if needed.  Kevin contacted me this last week, and called in that offer.  He's pencilled me down for another 4.5 hours of talks!<P><br/><br/>3 hours of that will be Simon Cozens' "Perl 5 Internals" class.  I'd been sketching an internals class before Simon started work on his, so I have an idea of what I need to say.  I have to admit that Simon's more comfortable with the innards than I am at this point, so I hope to have Sarathy in the audience to field any particularly tricky questions!  The obvious question is "why isn't Simon giving his class?"  He has exams and can't make YAPC, a disappointment to us all.  If you are curious, though, the class will be offered by The Man Himself at <A HREF="http://conferences.oreilly.com/perl">TPC5</A> in July.<P><br/><br/>What to do for the other 90 minutes?  Well, 45 of those I want to be at Adam Turoff's apprenticeship hour.  I have some pet projects to find people to do.  My current thinking is to give that 45 minutes to Pudge to talk about OS X and show the pretty laptops off.  Failing that I'll show the first episode of the "Witches Abroad" show (to help people understand Jarkko's Terry Pratchett quotes).<P><br/><br/>I have slides for the 25 minutes of talks.  I'm working on slides for Simon's class.  I have no idea what I will talk about for the first 45 minutes on Wednesday.  I'm currently leaning towards teaching as much of the new "Advanced Perl" class as I possibly can in 45 minutes.  That might involve a lightning romp through the material, though.  If you have better suggestions, mail them to me at <TT>gnat@oreilly.com</TT><P><br/><br/>Less than three days to go ....  Woohoo!<P><br/><br/><I>--Nat</I></p>
