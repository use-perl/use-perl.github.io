<p>From <a href="http://www.macosrumors.com/">MacOSRumors</a>:
<blockquote>
Microsoft may never release a 6.x version of Internet Explorer for the
Mac, according to Apple sources. This is because "the browser is the
operating system," as Netscape and Microsoft both realized back in the
days of the full-on browser wars; Apple plans to introduce its own
version of the Mozilla/Chimera browser with tie-ins to .Mac (called,
by some, Web.Mac) for this very reason.
</blockquote>

and from <a href="http://www.macslash.org/">MacSlash</a>:

<blockquote>
IvyMike writes "It might not be the most scientific thing in the
 world, but the statistics at Google's Zeitgeist page show that five
 percent of the queries to google come from Macs. That's interesting
 because it's the first time since they've published Zeitgeist that
 the number is bigger than four percent."
</blockquote>

I'm running Mozilla on OS X.  What pisses me off the most (other than when it crashes) is the typeahead in the URL buffer--why is it so slow to display the text you type?  Perhaps if Apple is working on Mozilla we'll see some of the kinks ironed out ...<p>

<h2>Faster</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-10-17T16:10:13</h3>
In Mozilla 0.9x, it was faster.  Maybe even 1.0.  I don't know why it got slower, but one day I updated, and it was slower.

<p>
  IIRC they changed the sorting order of the history to be more accurate (which is true, I love that feature) than something stupidly alphabetic. I guess somehow there's a bad interaction in the Mac version.

<h2>Opera</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jhi/">jhi</a> on 2002-10-17T16:19:32</h3>
I rather like Opera, now that they finally got out the Beta 1 for Opera 6 for Mac OS X.  Yes, it's adware unless you pay up.  Tough.  Chimera is reasonable, though it's in some spots a bit too minimalistic.  The full Mozilla belongs to the bottom of Tokyo Bay.<br> <br>

<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2002-10-17T18:12:04</h3>
<p>and don't forget that Chimera is crashy-crashy. Mine croaks at least once if not twice a day.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2002-10-23T15:38:05</h3>
What version of Chimera are you running?
<p>
Chimera 0.4 was <b>very</b> crash prone.  The 0.5 nightly build I installed (2002090505) was <i>much</i> better, but I've also learned how not to stress it.
</p><p>
Regardless, both Mozilla and Chimera crash much more frequently than I remember Mozilla crashing under X or Windows.  Quitting pre-emptively helps a lot.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/belg4mit/">belg4mit</a> on 2002-10-17T18:05:53</h3>
What gets my is the brain dead algorythm used.<br>At least in NN4 (and IIRC Mozilla) it goes for<br>the longest possible URI. What I want is tab<br>completion a la shell.



<h2>Expected...</h2>

<ul><li><i>Microsoft may never release a 6.x version of Internet Explorer for the Mac, according to Apple sources.</i></li></ul>  <br> <p>When MS came out with IE for free, they said that they wanted to make an Industry Standard browser, and thus were supporting it on all platforms, Solaris, Linux, Macs and of course, Windows.  They also said that it'd be free for all time.<br> </p><p>Turns out that it's neither free nor cross-platform.  People THINK it's free, but it's really included when you purchase an up-to-date Windows OS.  They stopped producing it for Win 3.1 awhile back.  I think they stopped supporting Win 95, or they announced that they will in the future.</p>



<h2>Type ahead</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Fletch/">Fletch</a> on 2002-10-17T19:04:45</h3>
<p>
According to the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla1.2b/" title="mozilla.org">1.2 beta release notes</a mozilla.org> typeahead now works.
