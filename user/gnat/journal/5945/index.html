<p>Registration was moderately busy.  As usual I had registered under a stupid name which I had forgotten, so after a bit of searching we found my "Colonel Moriarty" tag.  I have no idea what I was thinking.  What can I say--I was under the influence of the Goon Show at the time.<p>

Dinner was fun.  Larry, Damian, Simon, Jarkko, Allison, Dan, Jeff Goff, Jon, Damian and I all sitting around talking and eating.  Well, they talked.  I was writing the draft script of my lightning talk on Allison's iBook.  Damian was peeking over my shoulder and egging me on.  We mind-melded a couple of times, where he'd suggest   a line that I'd just thought of myself.  Very scary, but also a sign I was on the right track.<p>

It's 9pm and we've all split up back at the hotel.  I intend to sleep soon.  I am very tired and plan to be awake in time for tomorrow's free hotel breakfast.  Fingers crossed ...<p>

That's strange.  A superposition is supposed to resolve into a single state when it's observed.
