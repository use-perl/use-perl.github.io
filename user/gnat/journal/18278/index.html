<p>I don't shill for O'Reilly books in my blog, so be impressed that I'm sending out a major thumbs-up to <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/adobephoto/"><i>Adobe Photoshop CS One-on-One</i></a>.  I was initially quite nervous about the format--too many colours for a serious book!  Who was this guy trying to be funny?  But it's not painful, it's really useful, and it has an amazing index that lets you randomly access what at first seems like a sequential read of a book.<p>

I picked up some great things (levels tweaking, using the measure tool and Image>Rotate>Arbitrary to straighten images) and Jenine's working her way through the video lessons now.  She just described it as "fun and interesting" in a surprised kind of way.  I don't think anyone imagines that there's a fun way to learn the cool things Photoshop can do, but Deke's done it.  We only have Photoshop 7, not CS, but 90% of what he describes applies just as much to older Photoshops.<p>

Now, to tell her to go to sleep so I can read some more of the book ... :-)<p>

Having read the sample chapter it looks really good. I don't suppose there's any chance of a similar book for the Gimp? <i>That</i> would be great.

I doubt it.  I don't see the millions of home users with the Gimp, whereas Photoshop in various chopped-down forms comes with almost every PC, scanner, and digital camera these days.  Most of Photoshop's features are in the Gimp, though, so a lot of the techniques are still applicable.<p>

Gah. There you go agian. Talking about only publishing books if you think they're going to sell!<br> <br>I long for the good old days when publishers would publish any old crap just because they thought it was cool<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br>

When it comes to Photoshop, Deke's the man. His "Photoshop Bible" was a best seller back when I learned a little Photoshop 2.5. I'm not at all surprised that his book is so accessable.<br> <br>David
