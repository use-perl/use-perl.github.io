<p>What did you do last night, Nat?  I watched <a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/genre/drama_mysteries/rebus/rebus.jsp">Rebus</a> on BBC America.  You should too.  It's unbe<i>expletive</i>lievably brilliant.  The lead actor was strong, the plots appropriately twisty, and the direction interesting.<p>

It's set in Edinburgh so I watched it with closed captioning on because even I, Commonwealthophile that I am, had trouble with the accents.  For example, last night a woman leaned over a balcony and yelled down "ish nae mack globby bootch scat fel mart!" which the closed captioning informed me was "if you don't move him from here, there's going to be murder".  This was, actually, what convinced me to turn on the closed captioning.  I couldn't decipher what she said after three boop-boops back with the TiVo so I admitted defeat.<p>

Anyway, foreign language issues aside, it's brilliant.  Rebus.  Here endeth the rave.<p>

<h2>good call</h2>

I watched it tonight on your recommendation. Excellent.<br/><br/>But I had no problem with the accents. Are they easier for a Yank?

Actually, I turned off captioning halfway through the second episode (the one you watch) as I didn't need it.  I guess it was just a few of the accents in the first that threw me.  In particular, that woman who yelled down from the balcony<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

I think I have Jenine hooked on Rebus too.</p><p>

<h2>It's not bad...</h2>

But it's horribly miscast, and nowhere near as good as the books.
