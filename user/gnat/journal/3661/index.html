<p>It's bloody nervewracking, hitting Enter on a commandline that sends 400+ messages.  I sent out the "sorry, your talk wasn't selected" messages (our motto--"Perl: Proudly Spamming For Over 10 Years"), and just as it has been the last few years (when I did just the Perl conference notifications) it was scary to run the program on real data with mailing enabled.<p>

Ooh, ooh, I got mine too!  I've gotten used to having talks turned down, I'd probably have been more surprised to get accepted<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

I had three proposals rejected too. The OSCon team had a serious overabundance of riches this year and had to turn down a very large number of excellent proposals. No-one should feel the least bit slighted if their talk wasn't accepted.

<i> I had three proposals rejected too. </i> <p>

Why, however, do I get the feeling that this was slightly less than the 100% suffered by a lot of
folk I know?
<br>I know, I know - with 500-odd suggestions and only 100 places, it's a tough choice, and whatever you do, you're going to piss someone off. I kinda feel sorry for the team for having to make such a choice, but that's they're job - instead, I'll be sorry for the friends I know who can't go to TPC any more.</p>

I was just making the point that they cut <i>everybody</i> back hard this year. And that there were no favours done: it was strictly on merit and perceived marketability.

<p>No, I didn't suffer the 100% rejection rate that others did. But I did suffer more than an 80% rejection rate. Which is still pretty tough, given my track record.

Yes, that's certainly sad. Were there many who have previously gotten there only because they were subsidized as speakers?

<p>Of course, commercial/academic conferences have always been expensive to attend. Most of the conferences I've talked at over the years don't even "comp" non-keynote speakers. The one thing worse than not being paid to speak, is having to pay to speak.</p>

<h2>Mine showed!</h2>

And I'm hugely relieved. One fewer thing to talk about at TPC...

<p>I got all three of mine.</p>
<p>Look at it this way... was your talk good?  (Your talk, not your proposal.  My proposals sucked.)  If so, chances are the talks that were accepted are kick-ass.  It's going to be a good OSCON.</p>

And there's always a BOF if you really, really want to tell people about something.
