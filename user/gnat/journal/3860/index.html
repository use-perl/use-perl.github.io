<h2>Stall Man</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TorgoX/">TorgoX</a> on 2002-03-29T23:30:37</h3>
From <a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/2001-12/rossum_04.html" title="linux-mag.com">that article</a linux-mag.com>:
<p> <em>"There is no reasonable discussion possible, because he has his position,
and he will explain it any number of times. But his mind is made up and
he won't listen to other people's positions."</em>

</p><p>I have a working term for that phenomenon of Stall Man's: "crazy".

</p><p>Having been on the margins of crazy (in various dimensions) before, I
say it's officially okay to be crazy as long as you're not making
yourself or other people miserable.  But when your being crazy becomes a
Problem, as it clearly is for Stall Man, that means one just can't have
him around anymore.  And everyone I've every heard talk about having met him
describes him in terms usually reserved for encounters with plagues of locusts,
earthquakes, toxic gas clouds, or Tom Green.
</p><p>Can someone get him into therapy or something?  Just so he can routinely
bounce ideas off someone who can say things like "Hm, Richard, is that really
a productive approach?  Let's r&ocirc;le-play!  Remember what I said about the seven social skills to remember?"  Etc.
</p><p>I'd be happy if it came out of the FSFSFSFSF budget, since it'd clearly
make him a more "effective" spokesperson, instead of universally reviled as a blight upon society in spite of his occasionally good ideas.</p>
