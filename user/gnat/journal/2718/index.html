I'm the Mac user here and I still use Mac OS, with no plans to upgrade to Mac OS X.  WHAT'S WITH YOU PEOPLE?
<br>
<br>Maybe after I read <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/macosxmm/" title="oreilly.com">Mac OS X: The Missing Manual</a oreilly.com> I'll be won over.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I still mainly boot into OS9 too as the applications I have haven't reached critical mass on the OSX side yet. Classic mode sucks worse than Wine. Almost all of the OS X people I know are recent converts to the platform with little or no investment in OS9 apps. It's a time consuming PITA to migrate as well.</p>

Yeah, that's really the main thing.  It is a lot easier to migrate from *nix to Mac OS X than it is to migrate from Mac OS 9, in many cases.
<br>
<br>Although it'd almost be tolerable if it weren't for two things: the very big performance hit (on my G3 boxes, anyway), and those damned paned file dialogs.  I hate those things.  The Mac OS 8/9 Navigation Services are so much better, I really can't stand it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  It takes forever to drill down into deep directories, keyboard shortcuts mostly don't work at all, or work inanely.

Yep, I'm almost entirely OS X native, so it's not a big deal. (Though classic mode seems fine to me--little odd, but fine)
<br>
<br>Pity it's so clunky compared to OS 9. Better than Windows or any of the Unix desktops, but that's not exactly a stunning recommendation.

<h2>What Mail Clients Do They Use?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Theory/">Theory</a> on 2002-02-08T17:42:16</h3>
<p>I'm a TiBook G4 user myself, but I run Yellow Dog Linux. I've thought about switching, but have stopped on 3 issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>What's a good mail client to use? I don't think I could switch to OE.</li>

<li>I use GNU Emacs under X. Can I do that? And if so, what kind of resources would I suck up running X over OS X's hoggish UI?</li>

<li>libapreq doesn't work under OS X quite yet (though they're working on it, is see!).</li>
</ol>

<p>Regards,
David</p>

1. All sorts of things; mutt of course, or pine if you must. Entourage (part of OfficeX) if you're into that sort of thing: OK, so I am (educational status helps there!). Plenty of others available: Mulberry, particularly if you're a big IMAP fan, has a native OSX client.
<br>
<br>2. Sure. Xfree runs really well either rooted or rootless in OS X. Resource implications? very little; XDarwin chugs away at about a couple of percent CPU usage, spiking to around 10% as I gimp around a bit. The OS X window manager gets a little excited at times, but on a modern machine with a fair chunk of memory it's pretty negligible. If you do give this a go have a look at "OroborOSX"; an application that acts as a window manager, yet manages to put a thoroughly OS X-ish slant on X applications.
<br>
<br>http:// www.versiontracker.com/macosx
<br>
<br>will give you more info about any of the apps mentioned above. Installing X is now as simple as any other mac app (and no configuration hell to deal with). OK, enough, enough: I'm sounding like an evangelist.
<br>
<br>3. One fine day...
<br>
<br>Cheers,
<br>Paul

I don't really know because I only use my laptop for movies, Terminal.app and a browser, but I saw a patch on the libapreq list recently for fixing Mac OS X stuff.
<br>
<br>For mail client, mutt should work fine.
<br>
<br>I use emacs without X everywhere anyway, and it works great on X too. (hah, parse that).

<h2>I haven't!!!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-02-08T19:39:05</h3>
<p>My main Macintosh still runs MacOS 9.  My new ibook that I got two weeks ago runs Debian.</p>

<p>Eventually I'm sure I will sample X.</p>



<h2>OS X Good</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jhi/">jhi</a> on 2002-02-11T02:06:48</h3>
<p>About the only gripe I have is that the Terminal application sucks raw eggs as a terminal application.  I haven't looked closely at what it thinks it's trying to do but it's not what I got used to-- 15 years ago on true VT100s and lookalikes.  As a UNIX interface nothing beats a good text terminal, and the Terminal isn't (hopefully "isn't <b>yet</b>").
<br>
<br> </p><p>Note that I may be barking at the wrong tree: maybe it's the combination of Terminal and the shell that is sucky.  But whatever it is, things like suspending your application simply don't work, and the terminal emulation seems flaky.  I have a suspicion about this and it is that Terminal wasn't really designed as a terminal, it's a text display widget glued with bubble gum to shell(s), which isn't enough for a dynamic workbench that a proper text terminal is.</p>
<br>
<br> <p>Yes, I do know there's rootless X11 and the true xterm (which works for me as a true text terminal), and OroborosX as the window manager.  But I'm kind of hoping someone at Apple would fix Terminal since I'd like to have my Unicode and fonts, too.</p>

Yep, the terminal is seriously screwed up. Some little things seem related to the fact that it doesn't run setuid (so that closing a window through the GUI means you get a ghost entry in the output from "who", as Terminal.app lacks  permission to write to the log file. )
<br>
<br>Another observation: if you have your preferences set to "use this shell: " instead of "use default login for this user" the terminal seems incapable of changing the ownership of the device file! That is, if<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/dev/ttyp6, for example, is owned by root:wheel and you open it as user jhi with terminal pref's as above, it'll *still* be owned by root:wheel instead of jhi:tty. Do the same thing with "default login" and the ownership changes as it should. I would guess this might be related to the first problem, but it is certainly indicates that your guess re "bubble gum" might not be far off the mark.
<br>
<br>[[Symptom: pretty hard to change "mesg" status when you don't own the device!]]
<br>
<br>I haven't had any problems with job suspension though: seems to work as expected here.
<br>

<br>Paul
