<p><b>And so it begins ...</b><p>

So this is how the New Year begins: archiving files to CD to make room on my external drive for my tarball of 2003 mail and work files.  Not with a bang, but with the slow whine of my CD burner.<p>

Once I get the archiving sorted out, the next job will be to sort through the exactly 200 non-spam messages in my INBOX and reply to them all.  Two weeks of vacation really makes the email pile up ....<p>

<b>On Resolutions ...</b><p>

"Any resolutions for the New Year?" asked <a href="http://www.bofh.org.uk:8080/">Piers</a> a few days ago.  My facetious answer was that the only resolution I had as the New Year came in was to find another glass of port, the implementation of which resolution was made problematic by the previous glasses of port I'd consumed.<p>

I tend to regard New Years Resolutions as a particular category of the Good Intentions that the Road to Hell was paved with.   I have plenty of those ("stay on top of my email", "lose weight", "spend more time with my kids") but they tend to be more "things I wish would happen" rather than "things I will make happen".  This year, though, I find myself with one major resolution to implement: to get out of the way more often.<p>

I don't <i>think</i> I'm an obstacle to many people, but I can think of a couple of places where the job needs a different person.  For example, running The Perl Foundation was such a job last year--I simply didn't have the time to do what needed to be done, so I found Allison and stepped aside.  I can see one or two other places where that needs to happen.<p>

<b>Travels</b><p>

Expedia 0wnz0rz my A55.  I just booked tickets to Sebastopol for a little two day hackathon with some fun employees, and then tickets for a trip through New York City (for LinuxWorld Expo) and Boston (for to be chillin').  Total cost: more than the cost of a new desktop PC.  Bah.<p>
