<p>My editing block passed.  I drew up a list of things that would go into the chapter and realized that they fell into two main headings, and that that was what would dictate the narrative flow.<p>

Of course, it was Chapter 1.  Chapter 1 is notorious for being a bugger to write--you have to set the groundwork for the rest of the book, so it's often easiest to write Chapter 1 <i>after</i> the rest of the book is written.  That way you can also pilfer examples from the other chapters :-)<p>

I am <i>so</i> glad to find out that chapter 1 being a pain isn't just me. On to chapters 2 and 3, then!

Part of my Standard Advice to Authors (as received on stone tablets from Linda Mui) is "don't start with Chapter 1".<p>

Sheesh--I made one of the classic mistakes. I'd best stay away from Sicilians and out of Asia, then...

Maybe I'm just weird, as I tend to stand with Chapter 1. Different strokes for different folks, I guess.

You can go to Asia, just don't start a land war.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>By the by, did you catch Clinton's thing on fencing masters?<br> <br>Here's the link:<br> <br>http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/user/wew/fencing/masters.html

I didn't have much trouble working on the MacPerl book, in large part because of my fairly extensive journalism background, where one guideline -- not a rule -- is to not start with your lead paragraph.  It's not a rule because a paragraph is much shorter and easier to write and rewrite than a chapter, and further, sometimes a lead paragraph helps to put the rest of the story into the proper perspective, if focus is a problem.  However, the same principle holds: if you are having problems, just start writing.  You can always come back later.
