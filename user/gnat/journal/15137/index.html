<p>Today is the middle day of the editors meeting in Sebastopol.  It's absolutely awesome to meet everyone I work with and trade email with, although the long days of meetings (8:30AM to 8:30PM) are hell.  I arrived early (Monday) and caught up with a lot of the people here that I won't be seeing in the meetings.<p>

I wish I could get out to Sebastopol more often, I like the people so much.  That said, I'm not enjoying being away from my family.  William said "where are you Daddy?" and when I told him "California", he said "maybe Mum and Raley and me could go to California too?"  I explained why they couldn't, but we're counting "sleeps" until I get back (4 now).<p>

At least three of us editors have Nokia 3650 phones and we're learning to program them in Java.  Yes, I'm learning Java.  The world is quite possibly coming to an end.  It's fun, in the way that being a detective and figuring the correct path through a maze of APIs all alike is fun.<p>

We're in the middle of a big legal briefing.  Finally we have a good lawyer working for us.  She's clear, fun, and not at all wishy-washy.  It's great.  My previous exposure to corporate lawyers left me with a bad taste in my mouth.  Roberta is very Northern California, casual, in command, and really knows her stuff.  It's great.<p>

I just took your recommendation and ordered a Nokia 3650. Is it too early to place an order for Nokia Hacks?

<p>It's a pleasant enough place, but the sun is too high in the sky for me.  Also, darkness falls too late.  However, <b>you must eat breakfast at the Pine Cone</b>.  Order the french toast.  mmm.
