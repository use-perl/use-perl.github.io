<p>Good: Kiwi actors all over the place.  Temuera Morrison (who played Jango Fett), Jay Laga'aia (security trooper guy), and Daniel Logan (baby Boba).  Some of the industrial landscape shots.<p>

Bad: some of the effects (knife cutting levitated pear was crap, assassin getting out of buggy was crap).  All of the screenplay.  All of it.  Too long, way too long.  The direction sucked, too.  The actors were obviously instructed to deliver their lines as though it was Shakespeare, and there are stupid things like two seconds of character shot where the only word is "hmm".  BOR-FUCKING-ING.<p>

Summary: Lucas thinks he's Speilberg, but he isn't even South Park.  The only upside is that an entire generation of filmmakers will get their start because they walked out of the movie theatre swearing and saying "<i>I</i> could do better than that!"<p>

<h2>Jango and the clones</h2>

I wondered if Jango was played by someone that was Maori or at least Polynesian (I'm assuming he is part Maori since you said he was a Kiwi actor). <br> <br>This sort of has to do with some professor claiming that 'Clones was discriminating against Mexicans and other poeple of color. He was saying that Jango looked hispanic and that he was a terrorist. Also, the clone army was based on him and where programmed to be more docilie, blah, blah, blah. Basically painting hispanics and people of color in a bad light.<br> <br>

Yet one of the top Jedi is a black man.  Yoda is green.

<p>I don't know, with acting like that even the black community might call Samuel Jackson white. And Yoda is just Kermit the Frog repackaged for space opera<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) In the pilot for Star Trek, Kirk did it with a green chick...now <i>that's</i> entertainment<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Star Trek had two pilots.  Kirk was not in the one with the green woman (the Orion).  Instead it was the previous captain of the Enterprise, Captain Pike.  Pike returned in "The Menagerie," a two part episode which reprised the entire pilot ("The Cage") and reunited Pike with his love (who was only temporarily an Orion).  In fact, I believe the original copy of "The Cage" was lost and it was reconstructed from footage in "The Menagerie."</p>

<p>I officially have no life.</p>

Yup, Temuera Morrison ("Jake the Muss" in "Once Were Warriors" if you want his classic performance) was Jango and the clones.<p>

I'd heard about the Latino thing.  Hilarious.  <a href="http://detnews.com/2002/entertainment/0205/18/d01-492788.htm" title="detnews.com">Here's one story</a detnews.com>.  Some people just LOVE to be offended.</p><p>

&gt; Yup, Temuera Morrison ("Jake the Muss" in <br>&gt; "Once Were Warriors" <br> <br>... now, that  was a cool movie.

I don't think anybody _loves_ to be offended.<br> <br>I do think that some people of color are so used to being treated like crap by white people, and so used to offensive portrayals of people in color in movies and tv, that they become extremely sensitive to this particular issue, to the point of seeing offenses that (perhaps) don't exist.<br> <br>But to simply discard that as "they love to be offended" is what racism is all about.  _You_ aren't affected, so _you_ can laugh it off as _their_ problem.  I hate to break it to you.  The problem is you and me and other white people, not them.

Technically, no, they don't love to be offended.  However, they do perversely look forward to it and even seek it out, because they can use it as a means to their political end.<br> <br>And no, that is not what racism is all about.  You're making up definitions again.  Racism is about subjugating people because of race; it's not about dismissing claims because they are stupid.  Stupid claims <i>are</i> them.  I <i>can</i> laugh it off, because it is stupid.<br>

<p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>/me is reminded of the "Offensensitivity" <i>Bloom
County</i> strip (which surprisingly doesn't show
up with a quick googling; one would think that
somebody would have scanned it in), which ends with
everyone running off after determining that life
itself is offensive.
