<div class="span8">
<p>400 pages of GIF, JPG, SWF, SVG, PNG, and Gimp love (probably a lot more, too--those are just off the top of my head).  If you can read it in the next two weeks, please send me mail (gnat AT oreilly.com) because Uncle Sam^W Tim Wants You :-)  You'll be doing a tech review, so you'll be making sure that it serves the needs of a technical audience (i.e., you), covers the right things, and doesn't make mistakes doing so.  We need both graphics gurus and wannabes.<p>

To whet your appetite ... this is by the author of "Programming Web Graphics with Perl and GNU Software".  He started with that MS, and gutted it, rebuilding it to focus on Perl and Perl programming.  While some examples are webbish, this new book is a lot more focused on programming than web toys.<p>

Thanks,<p>

<p>Ahh, the titi book!  I have fond memories -- it was the first book I ever reviewed, the inspiration to play with Perl seriously at work, and was purchased at Powell's Technical, just down the street.  It wasn't my first animal book, but it was one of the first in my collection.

How's that for a tangent?

you're a big *tease*, gnat!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>I'd *love* to read it, but know that I won't have time in the next two weeks... already commited to those chapters of that other book, and the wife would kill me if I fell off  of the planet long enough to read 'em both.<br> <br>...just have to wait for it to hit the press<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>looking forward to it, though...<br> <br>-matt
