<div class="span8">
<p>One of the themes I heard consistently at YAPC was that every XML hacker who learned XPath said their life had changed.  I played a little with XPath last night while writing the XML chapter for Cookbook 2ed, and I have to say--they're right.  XPath is incredible.<p>

For those of you who don't know, XPath provides a kind of structural regular expression for finding the bits of an XML parse tree that you're interested in.  For example, here's the XPath for "the <tt>href</tt> attributes of <tt>a</tt> tags":

<blockquote>
<pre>
//a/@href
</pre>
</blockquote>

The double slash means "anywhere in the tree" (a single slash would mean you're giving a fully-qualified path to a node, starting from the root element) and <tt>@</tt> indicates you're talking about an attribute and not an element.<p>

Put in context, here's a program to print all the <tt>href</tt> attribute values of <tt>a</tt> tags:

<blockquote>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use XML::LibXML;
use strict;

my $parser = XML::LibXML->new;
my $dom = $parser->parse_fh(\*DATA);
my @nodes = $dom->findnodes('//a/@href');

foreach my $node (@nodes) {
  print $node->value, "\n"; }

__END__
<doc>
<p>
<a href="http://www.perl.org/">The perl.org web site</a> is much
sexier than <a href="http://www.python.org/">that of Python</a>.
</p>
</doc></pre></blockquote>

That's so much easier than walking trees!  Of course, an event-based parser could have handled this easily too.  But when you have more complex requirements for things to extract, XPath even beats SAX for convenience.<p>

For example, let's find the <tt>href</tt> attributes of <tt>a</tt> tags whose text contains <tt>Perl</tt>:

<blockquote>
<pre>//a[contains(text(), "perl")]/@href</pre>
</blockquote>

We can even go back up the tree, for example to find the <tt>p</tt> elements containing links:<p>

<blockquote><pre>//a/ancestor::p</pre></blockquote>

XPath expressions get hairy fast, like regular expressions:

<blockquote><pre>//a[contains(text(), "perl")]/ancestor::p</pre></blockquote>

Like Perl 6 regular expressions, XPath expressions can be padded with whitespace (also similar, there are a few places where whitespace is significant):

<blockquote><pre>//a
  [ contains( text(), "perl" ) ]
/ancestor::p</pre></blockquote>

The only beef I have about it is that I can't find a robust HTML parser that'll give me XPath.  The two pages I tried to parse were <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/">the O'Reilly Catalog</a> and <a href="http://use.perl.org/">the use.perl homepage</a>, and both had badly-formed HTML (overlapping tags, etc.).  <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">The W3C HTML validator</a> had conniptions, as did XML::LibXML.  I guess for real-world (i.e., broken) HTML, you still have to use regexps and the parsers described in <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/torgox/journal">TorgoX</a>'s <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perllwp/">book</a>.

<h2>XPath</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2003-07-01T21:45:06</h3>
<blockquote><div> <i>

</i> </div></blockquote>
Yep.  Wrap your brain around this hack:<blockquote><div> <tt>document(//a/@href[contains(., '.html')])/html/head/title</tt> </div></blockquote>In the context of an XSLT stylesheet (or something that provides the <code>document()</code> function to retrieve a document by name), this little tidbit finds all of the links containing<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>.html</code> in the href, fetches them, parses them, and returns the title of <i>each</i> page.
<p>
A spider.  In one expression.
</p><p>
Assign that to a nodeset and reapply the expression, and you're going two levels out.  (Or just nest the <code>document()</code> functions into something really contorted.)
</p><blockquote><div> <i>

</i> </div></blockquote>
Did you try munging the HTML with <code>tidy</code> first?  That works a decent amount of the time.  (You can have tidy emit XML/XHTML if you don't want to deal with HTML parsers.)

You can use TagSoup (http://tagsoup.info), my SAX parser for HTML.  I also have a version of Saxon 6 packaged with TagSoup for XSLT-ing arbitrary HTML.

Nat -<br> <br>Don't forget to talk about XML::LibXSLT's ability to write and register XPath extension functions written in Perl.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>Of course 1.53 has memory bugs, but if you get Matt's CVS copy, you can have Perl callbacks from XSLT. This is incredibly useful; say you want access Apache req objects from XSLT, using closures, in a handler().<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; $xslt-&gt;register_function($urn, 'get_request', sub { &amp;get_request($self,@_) } );<br> <br>Write get_request() to handle arguments to an XPath function (which can be strings or XML, and you can return (from the subroutine) strings or XML fragments to the XSLT XPath function. I use it to get parameters, set cookies, login users, etc. It's transparent as far as the XSLT goes.<br>

I wasn't sufficiently clear in my original message.  I was trying the parse_html_* methods in XML::LibXML and they were whining about broken HTML in the two pages I was playing with.  So I said "screw it" and sent back to parsing those with HTML::* modules.<p>

Doh. HTML parsers that can't parse broken HTML aren't that useful<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<br> <br>
Have you tried HTML::TreeBuilder with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/SAMTREGAR/Class-XPath-1.1/XPath.pm" title="cpan.org">Class::XPath</a cpan.org>?

I haven't, but boy that's really cute.  I was wondering the other day whether there were more general XPath modules available.  You know, with a little optimization (the ability to search a tree once but have multiple possible XPath expressions and associated actions to run at each step), you could use XPath as the basis for your optimizer--write XPath expressions for the things to optimize.<p>

Ah yes, I've known about XPath for three days.  Why wouldn't I assume I've had an original thought<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>
