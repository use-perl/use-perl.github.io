<p>The sexy topless-sunbathing neighbor, or the admonishments to local wives to stop complaining and take better care of their men-folk?</p>

Yes.  My neighbourhood has the women saying "You must come around to my place next Tuesday.  We're having a birthday party for the Baby Jesus!" and squealing at each other in delight.<p>

Oh, and <a href="http://www.9news.com/storyfull-co.asp?id=6994" title="9news.com">bank robber chases through back yards</a 9news.com>.  That happened just across the main road from us.  But no sexy topless sunbathers or admonishments to give up some lovin', no.</p><p>

This reminds me of a very nice song by Fabrizio de Andre`. The song's title is "Bocca di rosa", and you can find the lyrics <a href="http://www.katerpillar.it/musica/Album/Volume1_1967/boccadirosa.htm" title="katerpillar.it">here</a katerpillar.it>  (in italian, tho'). "Bocca di Rosa" is literally "Mouth of rose", I think an acceptable english version could be "Rosemund". I can try to translate some lines...<br> <br>She was called Rosemund<br>she put love, she put love<br>She was called Rosemund<br>she put love on everything<br> <br>When she arrived at the railway station<br>in St. Ilario little town<br>everybody realized with a glimpse<br>she was not a missionary<br>Someone makes love 'cause he's bored<br>someone makes it as a profession.<br>Rosemund not for the first reason, the second one neither<br>She made it for passion.<br> <br>The song tells her story: every man in St.Ilario falls in love with her (even the priest), and the women got pissed of this situation. So they ask police officers to ban her from the town. The policemen -- unwillingly -- execute. So she comes back to the railway station, to leave St.Ilario. A very pleasant song: try to listen it, if you find it somewhere.
