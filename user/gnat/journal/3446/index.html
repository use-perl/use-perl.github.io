<p><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0101915/">James Snell</a>, one of the authors of the Web Services book, is also a <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0101915/2002/03/10.html">Dad</a>.  He speaks the truth.  One day I was gussied up in my fancy teaching duds, wearing shoes and all, and as I was walking into the HQ of a multizillion dollar company whose stock had just gone through the roof, I realized I was humming the theme to <a href="http://www.sesameworkshop.org/sesamestreet/elmosworld/0,6558,,00.html">Elmo's World</a>.  Ngh.<p>

Speaking of babies, another of my authors, Rasmus Lerdorf, has <a href="http://phpics.com/baby">a new baby</a>.  Welcome to the clique.  Let's talk about the guilty convenience of disposable diapers and exclude <a href="http://www.axis-of-aevil.net/">militant non-breeders</a> :-)<p>

Compare and contrast: <a href="http://phpics.com/baby/abf">Rasmus's</a> and <a href="http://prometheus.frii.com/user/wt/20000312/S20000312-36-learning-latin.jpg">my</a> styles of parenting.  <a href="http://news.php.net/article.php?group=php.dev&article=80830">Rasmus's</a> and <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=patch+family+author:torkington&hl=en&scoring=r&selm=14256.36289.239559.380403%40localhost.frii.com&rnum=1">my</a> birth announcements.<p>

Confession time: last night I slammed William's pinky in the front door (accidentally, of course).  Fortunately it wasn't a knuckle, but it was still quite munted.  Baby Tylenol and Rescue Remedy are wonderful things (yes, I'm skeptical of herbal bullshit too, but he dropped off after two squirts and the bottle makes no mention of an alcohol base).  Jenine's in with him at the doctor's now (the next day), just checking to make sure it's not broken or anything.  It's as purple as all hell, and still (obviously) really sensitive.<p>

Poor little bugger was a trooper--he stood on the stool at the bathroom sink with cold water on his finger, howling, while I called down the road to tell Jenine to come up.  I asked him this morning what we did yesterday and he said "you squished my finger in the door and I cried."  It nearly broke my heart--fair turnaround, I suppose, as I nearly broke his finger.<p>

Watch it, parents.  The little buggers have enormous hooks into your heart.<p>

<p>Humming the theme is not nearly as bad as knowing the link.</p>



<h2>Patches...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/quidity/">quidity</a> on 2002-03-12T03:16:31</h3>
<p>But no one added:</p>

<code>Thanks, applied.</code>



<h2>oh, go on, make fun...</h2>

<p>But I'm pretty happy with my St. Bernard son who doesn't need nappies and I won't look like an old hag before my time. I still wear the size 6 I wore in college<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Bitch. </p>

Don't worry.  Children have soft bones.  They bounce!

According to the x-ray, he has a fracture in the last bone in the pinky.  Fortunately, says Dad, it's in the picking hand and not the fretting hand, so his banjo playing will be largely unaffected.  Actually, Doc says it'll heal and won't affect growth or function of finger.<p>

Is this the live child theory of economics?  <a href="http://www.ftmastering.com/mmo/mmo05_6.htm" title="ftmastering.com">Everything, even a live child, bounces if you drop it from high enough.</a ftmastering.com> </p><p>

Of course there was the other day when he grabbed my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553573357" title="amazon.com">Blue Mars</a amazon.com> and when I tried to put it back on the shelf he yelled, "NO!  Stu read Mars."
