<p>The trouble with conferences is that there's entirely too much to do.
Compared to OSCON, with 9+ parallel tracks, biocon's 3 tracks ought to
make for a much less frantic time.  But it didn't.  I ended up
bouncing between staff meetings, sessions, and hallway yakfests, all
the while feeling like I hadn't done everything I wanted to.<p>

The first keynote of the day was by Ewan Birney.  He's the Big Cheese
over at <a href="http://www.bioperl.org/">Bioperl</A>, famous for his
hidden markov model software, and many other things besides.  He gave
a high-level talk on what bioinformaticians do, which you'd think
would have bored an audience of bioinformaticians.  He was a really
interesting public speaker, however, and they soaked it up.<p>

Halfway through the keynote, Gina came over to me and whispered "what
do you think about Ewan keynoting at OSCON?"  I nodded my head
violently--it was just what I was thinking.  He can be easily
understood without a background in biology, and it echoes exactly why
we (O'Reilly) find interesting.<p>

We went up to Ewan after the keynote and congratulated him.  Then I
very casually said "Ewan, I see you've submitted a talk proposal for
OSCON."  Ewan nodded.  "Would you like to keynote?"  He nearly punched
the air.  "Yes!  That's exactly what I hoped you'd say--I wrote my
keynote with that in mind."  I'm glad he's glad--I imagine Ewan
sitting down at a table with Matt, Damian, Tim Bunce, et al., and I
nearly cackle at the prospect.  There's something infinitely pleasing
in bringing very smart people together.<p>

Ah, and I can't talk about the keynote without mentioning Tim's
introduction.  Tim talked about how Ewan had invited Tim to speak at
BOSC, and how bioinformatics was interesting all sorts of people.
Then he cited me as an example, and I believe his phrase was
"interested in extending his own biology" or some such innuendo.  It
was funny to see the laughter spread around the room, and I have to
admit that my mouth hung open in surprise.  It's not every day you're
called a masturbator by your boss during a plenary session :-)<p>

We had a staff meeting in the morning.  They're fun things in and of
themselves, because we always crack jokes, but compared to what's
going on outside, they just can't compare.  I missed most of the
(packed) visualization and "AI techniques for microarray analysis"
talks because of the meeting.  These meetings are the places where we
get to say things like "we need microphones in the crowd" or "the
signage is confusing around the dining room", etc.<p>

There was nearly disaster over a keynote.  I was supposed to introduce
the afternoon keynote, but spaced on it completely.  Fortunately Tim
did it and nobody noticed, but we quickly sorted out which of the
others I'd be introducing.<p>

I took the Cambridge office's camera around the various afternoon
talks, taking pictures.  I caught the first part of David Maddison's
"Tree of Life" project, an attempt to collate and visualize
phylogenetic information (charting how genes move between species).
It was very impressive.  The BioCORBA and BioPython talks were
surprisingly well attended (Perl is the language that gets all the
press), and Andrew Dalke's talk on file format parsing was packed.
Parsing in general was hot--Damian's tutorial on Monday was really
well-attended, and everyone talked about it for the rest of the
week.<p>

That night I worked in the staff room, preparing lead and chord sheets
for the jam BOF that night.  The jam bof had several musicians (me on
banjo, James Tisdall on guitar, Jason Stewart on guitar, Gina the
conference director singing, and others who popped in and out.  We had
a blast and played until the wee hours.  Even Damian came in and
joined in on some of the "The Band" tunes.  It's more fun every year!
For OSCON, I think I'll try to get it blurbed in the brochure this
time, so that more people know to bring instruments.<p>
