<div class="span8">
<p>When I taught references, part of the class was always how to do these types of fun things  Whether you're a C programmer or a Perl hacker using references, grokking <a href="http://www.function-pointer.org/">function pointers</a> ("code references" in the Perl world) will improve your coding.<p>

For example, your basic (and I mean basic, though not BASIC) adventure game is just:

<pre>
%choices = ( "north" => \&go_north,
                    "south" => \&go_south,
                    "east" => \&go_east,
                    "west" => \&go_west,
                    "quit" => \&bail );
while (<>) {
  chomp;
  if (exists $choices{$_}) {
    $choices{$_}();   # call the function
  } else {
    print "I'm sorry, I don't know how to: $_\n";
  }
}

sub go_north {
  print "You trudge northward.\n";
}
# etc for go_east, go_west, go_south
sub bail {
  print "Goodbye!\n";
  exit;
}
</pre>

Those of you who took my Perl classes may remember that :-)  Keys of the hash are commands.  The value for a command is a reference to the function to run when the user types that command.  If I want to add aliases, I can just say:

<pre>
$choices{s} = $choices{south};
$choices{widdershins} = $choices{east};
</pre>

Or generate a lot of aliases automatically:

<pre>
foreach my $cmd (keys %choices) {
  $choices{substr($cmd, 0, 1)} = $choices{$cmd};
}
</pre>

Try doing that with the "easy" approach:

<pre>
while (<>) {
  chomp;
  if ($_ eq "north") { 
    print "You trudge northward.\n";
  } elsif (...) {
    ...
  } elsif ($_ eq "quit") {
    print "Goodbye!\n";
    exit;
  } else {
    print "I'm sorry, I don't understand: $_\n";
  }
}
</pre> 

It's a real bugger to add aliases to <i>that</i>.<p>

Callbacks:

<pre>
sub apply_to_lines {
  my ($filename, $code) = @_;
  local $_;

  open my $fh, "<", $filename or die "Can't open $filename: $!";
  while (<$fh>) {
    $code->($_);
  }
  close $fh;
}

$line_count = 0;
apply_to_lines( "/etc/passwd", sub { $line_count++ } );
print "/etc/passwd has $line_count lines\n";
$longest_line = '';
apply_to_lines( "/etc/passwd", sub {
  $line = shift;
  $longest_line = $line if length($line) > length($longest_line);
});
print "The longest line is: $longest_line\n";
</pre>

The same subroutine, <tt>apply_to_lines</tt>, can be used to both count lines or find the longest line.  That's the fundamental idea of callbacks: customizing your code by letting the user supply an action, not just a value or variable to store a value into.<p>

Of course, you can do cooler stuff in Perl with code refs than you can in C with function pointers.  For example, mess with the symbol table ...<p>

<pre>
foreach my $colour (qw(red green blue black nastybrown)) {
  no strict 'refs';
  *$colour = sub { print "<font color=$colour>@_</font>" };
}
</pre>

<tt>*$colour</tt> means "the symbol table entry for the symbol whose name is in <tt>$colour</tt>".  So the first time through the loop it's "the symbol table for the symbol <tt>red</tt>", then it's "the symbol table entry for <tt>green</tt>", etc.  By assigning a code reference to that symbol table entry, you change what Perl thinks is the function called <tt>red</tt>, <tt>green</tt>, etc.  This kind of messing with Perl's head is what Damian and Dominus do five times before breakfast.<p>

End result is that we define a bunch of subroutines, each of which prints some different HTML.  If you haven't thought of it, it's fun to realize that because <tt>$colour</tt> is a private (<tt>my</tt>) variable, it is allocated new memory each time through the loop and so each subroutine refers to a different value of <tt>$colour</tt>, whereas <tt>@_</tt> is a global variable and so the automatically generated <tt>red</tt>, <tt>green</tt> etc. subroutines use whatever value <tt>@_</tt> has when the subroutine is called.  Once you've figured out what <i>that</i> meant, figure out what happens when you take <tt>my</tt> out of the <tt>foreach</tt> loop.<p>

And so on.  Lots more uses, no doubt explained in <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lrnperlorm">the Alcapacapal</a>, but ENOSLEEP.  Jenine's written her epistles to her friends ("First Coloradoans, Chapter 2, Verse 3: Raley didst try me verily, and I didst want to smite her.  Vengeance will be mine, sayeth the Mommy, especially if you don't stop flipping those bloody light switches!") and it's bedtime.   Ninight.<p>

<h2>gcc nested functions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mary.poppins/">mary.poppins</a> on 2004-03-17T20:42:42</h3>
I think that gcc's nested functions are fun.  I wish they'd been<br>added to the C99 standard....<br> <br>A fun ML thing is partially applied functions:  If foo takes two<br>args, a and b, then (foo a) is the same as (fun b -&gt; foo a b).<br>Of course, to do this you need static typing.<br>



<h2>Choices</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2004-03-18T02:59:02</h3>
Or even more easily generated choices:<blockquote><div> <tt>foreach my $cmd (keys %choices) {<br>&nbsp; for my $i (1..length $cmd) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $choices{substr($cmd, 0, $i)} = $choices{$cmd};<br>&nbsp; }<br>}</tt> </div></blockquote>N, NO, NOR, NORT, NORTH....



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Choices</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/htoug/">htoug</a> on 2004-03-18T06:26:28</h3>
That will only work as long as the choices are unique on the first letter.<p>
It would be much better to use the <code>Text::Abbrev</code> module (it's part of the core). It'll create unique abbreviations. Of course the code would be a little more convoluted:<br> </p><blockquote><div> <tt>use Text::Abbrev;<br>my %abbrev_choices;<br>my %abbrevs = abbrev(keys %choices);<br>foreach my $abbrev (keys %abbrevs) {<br>&nbsp; $abbrev_choices{$abbrev} = $choices{$abbrevs{$abbrev}};<br>}<br>%choices = %abbrev_choices;</tt> </div></blockquote>(or something like that - completely untested and of my hat)



<h2>Re:Choices</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/BooK/">BooK</a> on 2004-03-18T15:38:52</h3>
<p>Or, rather than filling the hash with small keys, make a smarter dispatcher:</p> <blockquote><div> <tt># find those commands which could match<br>@cmd = grep {<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/^$cmd/ } keys %cmd;<br># die if none or several commands match<br>die "Ambiguous command $cmd (@cmd)" if @cmd != 1;<br># call the routine<br>$cmd{shift@cmd}(@args);</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>Mmm, <tt>$cmd</tt>, <tt>@cmd</tt> and <tt>%cmd</tt> used in 3 lines... That's one point
in the Perl purity test.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt> </p>
