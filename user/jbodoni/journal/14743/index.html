<p>Aaaarrrgh!<p>
After lusting for the technology for months, I finally got a bluetooth-enable phone yesterday evening.  Most of last night and today were spent trying get an education (for myself AND the unclueful folk at 1-866-CINGULAR) on how it's all supposed to work.<p>
The connection 'twixt the laptop and phone is working; when someone calls the phone, my iBook happily asks if I'd like to answer the call or chuck it to voice mail.<p>
The phone itself can do webful things, such as snag the weather forecast.<p>
Nobody at Cingular seems to know what to do next... after all, everything's fine on their end!<p>
<b>GRRRRRR!!</b><p>

You didn't phrase your posting as a question.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>Maybe you'll find <a href="http://askask.com/a/2003/01/24/000257.html" title="askask.com">this useful</a askask.com>.  Except you have to use bluetooth instead of IrDA of course.<br> <br>The magic is often in picking the right "modem script".<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; - ask

You're right, of course.  My problem was that rage makes me incoherent.<p>
The answer to the question: "What do I need to allow my laptop surf the web via my new Bluetooth phone?" is "Quicklink for Macintosh", the googling of which is left as an exercise to the reader.</p><p>
$40 USD and fifteen minutes later, I'm golden.</p><p>

John,<br/><br/>  This reader has the same problem as you; iBook, Cingular, Bluetooth - no web access. However the "exercise to the reader" refered above is not obvious to me. Can you PLEASE help me with the next step to make the web work? (I've stumped a number of Mac experts - one of which refused even to charge me for his time because he couldn't figure it out). ALL help will be DEEPLY appreciated!!<br/><br/>  Very sincerely, John

Go to <a href="http://www.smithmicro.com/" title="smithmicro.com">Smith Micro's website</a smithmicro.com> and snag "Quicklink Mobile for Mac OSX".  It looks like they've changed the name and increased the price, but it probably works the same.<p>The installer does a great job of taking you by the hand, asking for your provider and phone model.</p><p>You probably want to verify with Cingular that you won't be paying an arm and a leg for internet access... I was shocked when I got the first phone bill after the first month!</p><p>Let me know if I can be of more help.</p><p>John</p>
