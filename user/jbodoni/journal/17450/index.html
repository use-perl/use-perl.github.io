<p>Well... for suitably tame definitions of "wildest".<p>My evening routine includes dumping my pocket change into the change bucket.  While watching some TV tonight I rolled most of that change, 'cause it's been close to a year since the last rolling.<p>When I got tired of rolling after almost three hours, I stopped and counted it up: a little less than $250.  <em>This doesn't include the big honkin' pile of quarters I set aside because I ran out of wrappers.</em>  The temptation to wallow in my new wealth was strong, but I resisted.  Plus, it would have been lumpy wallowing.<p>My wife would like to go out to eat at our favorite place tomorrow night, which would consume somewhere between one third and one half of that amount.  That sound you hear is me rolling my eyes.<p>With any luck, once I get back from a small moonlighting gig, and then start in on fixing the leak in her bathtub, it will be too late to go out.<p>Don't get me wrong - I love my wife, and love to do things that make her happy, but I'd like to see this scavenged sum get set aside for a rainy day.<p>Wish me luck...</p>

<h2>Dinner?</h2>

<p>
You are going somewhere and pay as much as <i>$125.00</i> for a meal? What, pray, do they serve there?</p>

Something decently nice? Going out in London I routinly pay that for rather lousy meals, or we end up at Nobus and pay 5 times the amount.

Please tell me where Nobus is so I can avoid it if I am ever in London. Although at those prices it seems very doubtful I could afford to go to London at all.</p>
<p>
I have eaten very good meals in New York City for a lot less than that (nowhere with <i>ambiance</i>, of course).</p>

Mind you, this includes a large antipasto appetizer, an entree for each of us, some drinks (including shots downed with our waiter and bartender, and the owner if we can pry him out of the kitchen), dessert, coffee, and tip.  It is truly An Event that provides good value for your money.<p>And the entree menu is a joy.</p><ul> <li>Roast pork shank that's flaking-tender on the inside and crispy crunchy on the outside, served with a port reduction that's good enough to eat <em>by itself</em> with maybe some bread to sop it up.</li> <li>Ravioli made by hand, today.</li> <li>Ribeye steaks cut by hand, seared on the stove top in cast iron and moved to the stove to reach medium-rare perfection.</li> <li>Mashed potatoes rich with LOTS butter and garlic</li> </ul>
Oh, this was a mistake.  I've got an hour yet before lunch and my gut's rumbling like there's no tomorrow!<p> <strong>Must... curb... appetite!</strong> </p><p>Ah, thank goodness for rotten.com!</p>

<h2>Shrapnel</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2004-02-17T10:45:34</h3>
<p>As a child I use to save small change and take it to the bank, to put in my savings account. I once deposited &pound;18 in small change - the bank was happy as long as it was correctly bagged.</p>

<p>While living in the US I was shocked to discover that many US banks refuse to accept change, even packaged, or if they do - they take a commission on the deposit! A house mate was very annoyed to discover that his jar of quarters was going to be harder to bank than he had anticipated when I started to fill it many years earlier.</p>

<p>Now I don't have a problem with shrapnel in my pockets, I give all my change to my better half, and she magics it away. It's better for me too, if I don't have change in my pocket, I don't buy snack food, and my pockets don't get holes in them anymore.</p>
