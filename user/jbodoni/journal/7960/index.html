<p>Hiya.<p>
What's important to know about me, in this context?  Let's see...<p>

<i>(Playing right now: Linkin Park "In The End".  What a great song.  I normally don't care much for 'spoken word' art, but these guys strike a great balance between the spoken and the sung lyrics.  Driving rythm, sweeping guitar chords, and a simple keyboard floating above it all.)</i><p>

First should be that Perl makes me code with a grin on my face.  That hasn't happened since... well, since I opened the shrinkwrap on the first HyperCard that hit the shelf in my town.<p>
Second, I'm new - painfully so - to all things Perl.  Granted, TMTOWTDI, but my way usually seems to be the WRONG way!  I write code the wrong wrong way, make stupid mistakes, re-invent the wheel rather than use modules from CPAN, etc.  Fortunately, as I learn more I'm able to go back to the programs I've written and re-work them.<p>
Third, ... I dunno.  I guess it's also important to know that I need my sleep.  It's starting to get late.  8)  What would you like to know?<p>

Goals for tomorrow, while I'm still coherent:
<ul>
<li>Try to figure out why, oh why, does the web server not want to run my ODBC query?  There will be much wailing and gnashing of teeth before this is over, I'm sure.</li>
<li>Make the weekly report generator dump out a page for my use that contains EndUser, RequestDate, ShortDescription, Body, and ResolutionText for all high priority calls.</li>
<li>Ditto for the after hours calls.</li>
<li>Consider breaking up the "Current Queue Report" into different sections, with hyperlinks to each section</li>
<li>Figure out how to use one of the "Date" modules to provide me with the start date and end date of the previous calendar week.</li>
<li>Start using CGI.pm, dammit!</li>
</ul>

<i>(Playing right now: Joe Satriani "Circles".  Satch just plain rocks.  Note to self: beat the hell out of the CD player in my car until it works again, so I can listen to "Surfing With The Alien" with the top down before winter!)</i><p>
G'night all.<p>
John</p>

<h2>Tip for people new to Perl, much like you</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2002-09-24T06:55:10</h3>
There's a nice friendly forum for people much like you: <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/" title="perlmonks.org">perlmonks.org</a perlmonks.org>. I think you'll find many people with the same profile (including the music<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) as you, there.
<p> They'll gladly help you get ODBC to work on your webserver, make your first steps using CGI.pm, figure out how to use the Date modules, etc. They don't even mind the topic getting off-Perl (as for example with the database problem). And for tiny problems, the Chatterbox is ideal.</p>

Thanks, Bart.  I'm aware of perlmonks and its chatterbox (seems pretty cool to me!), and will probably make my way over there before much longer.<p>
