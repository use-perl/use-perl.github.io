<p>Last night (about 8:30) my wife and I had just put the kids to bed and finished cleaning up after dinner and I get a phone call from one of the parents on Sheila's soccer team.<br/><br/>He said that he was having computer problems and needed my help. OK I said, whatÃ¢â¬â¢s the problem. He stated that it is running very slow and he canÃ¢â¬â¢t do anything :(<br/><br/>OK I said, Lets see, When did this start to happen?
(him) well I donÃ¢â¬â¢t know, it was after I went on the internet.
(me) you were on the internet when this happened?
(him) yes.
(me) were you reading your e-mail?
(him) yes
(me) OK, Do you have antivirus software installed?
(him) I donÃ¢â¬â¢t know, what is antivirus software?
(me) {sigh} You didnÃ¢â¬â¢t happen to click on an attachment did you?
(him) What is an attachment?
(I am NOT kidding here he did say that)
(me) OK, Can you bring up the task manager?
(him) How do I do that?
(me) press ctl-alt-del keys to bring it up (He is running WinXP)
Ã¢â¬Â¦
This went on for about 10 min. During this time I could not stop thinking a scene in the movie Ã¢â¬ËEnemy of the stateÃ¢â¬â¢ where Gene Hackman and Will Smith are on top of the building and Gene Hackman is explaining what is going on and Will Smith has no clue.
That was the way I felt.  <br/><br/>ItÃ¢â¬â¢s hard to believe that some people are so ignorant when it comes to computers. 
I think before someone is allowed to connect to the internet they need to take a test. Basic
Computer knowledge, antivirus software and what knot.<br/><br/>Anyway, guess what I will be doing when I get home !!

Hahahahaha!!<br>That is funny.<br>Actually, he is going to drop off the computer (it's a laptop) so I can fix it.<br>And yes I will install antivirus software along with<br>some user training. (we'll see how that goes)<br>
