<p><p>I completed my 5 day SAP ADM100 training course. I can't say that I was impressed. The instructor was nice enough, clear and helpful, and knew what she was talking about, but the course she had to present was not as good.</p>

<ul>
<li>The course notes, and slides were not well translated from the German original. In many places the notes contradict themselves, or repeated themselves for no apparent reason.</li>
<li>The type face in the notes was small, and there wasn't enough white space to see what was going on. There wasn't enough space to make notes directly into the course manual either.</li>
<li>I'm not convinced that the course structure was good, even the instructor changed the order to try and make some sense out of the whole mess.</li>
<li>The IT facilities were poor, which is unacceptable for the UK HQ of the largest software company in Europe. The PCs had all sorts of problems, and running Windows terminal services over Windows terminal services is not the most efficient way of doing anything.</li>
<li>Our example SAP systems were running on Windows, and most serious SAP installs run on Unix/Linux or mainframe, so much of the cute Windows GUI stuff was wasted on me and most of the delegates. Additionnaly the Windows stuff is painfully slow to do when compared to a command line.</li>
<li>I also think the course was poorly described, some people in our group pretty much learned nothing new, others struggled all the way, it is clearly not attracting the right level of person.</li>
</ul>

<p>The more I use SAP, the more I realise it's an awful hack, held together with string and sticky-tape. However it's nice experience to have on a CV, and in the current labour market that's important.</p></p>
