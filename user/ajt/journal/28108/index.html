<p><p>I don't like Christmas and New Year. I have bad memories from childhood and as an adult it's continued to be stress filled and annoying. I even have the fun of working between Xmas and the New Year this year while the rest of the country make it's self sick from over indulgence.</p>

<p>On the up side work should be quiet and easy and I can get interesting things done without the constant nag of users.</p>

I find that it is not my favorite time of year either.

<p>I'm think many people don't actually like Christmas - they just aren't allowed to say so by society.</p>

<p>Well, I don't announce it but usually someone will see I am not high on eggnog and ask...then I tell them. Otherwise, I try to remain silent lest I ruin someone elses./P.</p>

to me just an excuse to go out and have fun.
but i am sick(bad flu) and trying to stay away from everyone<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-/

<p>I'm not convinced about the fun. Eating too much, drinking too much, family arguments, shopping hell and travel nightmares are hardly my ideas of fun.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to doing nothing special, even working over the break doesn't seem so bad after all.</p>

I just went to the supermarket to buy some yoghurts... damn crazed confusion...<br><br>And plus there's always Christmas music everywhere!<br><br>And about 20 or 30 more bad things.

<p>Shops scare me at this time of year. They are full of wild people gripped by some kind of madness. You'd think that the world was about to end and they just had to go out and spend everything left.</p>

<h2>Mmm, humbugs!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/drhyde/">drhyde</a> on 2005-12-29T21:24:38</h3>
Well I fucking love christmas.  It's aboutthe only time of year when I'm *not* a grumpy old bastard.

<p>I can't believe that you are every grumpy...!</p>

<p>You are quite welcome to enjoy christmas, just don't expect me too.</p>

<p>Actually I was expecting your post to be about eating humbugs - given the title...</p>
