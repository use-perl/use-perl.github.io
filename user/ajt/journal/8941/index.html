<p><p><a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> 7 beta 1 for Windows was released to the public this week. Okay it's not open source, nor is it free beer (adware), but it's always been a pretty good if not very popular browser.</p>

<p>Externally it still looks very similar to the older 5.x/6.x GUI - so it's still a bit ugly when compared with a Mozilla based browser. The excellent tabbed interface is still there, and there are now more ways to slice and dice the interface. Internally the new version is a major re-write of the rendering engine, and on a few quick tests on DOM pages that the old browser failed on, it passes quite well.</p>

<p>At the end of the day not many people will actually use it - which is a shame, as it's a tiny download, and blisteringly fast......</p></p>

<p>... I've always found Mozilla to be garishly ugly (never mind slow as a sloth in molasses [1]), no matter what platform, and Opera 6 is my broser of choice, at least in Windows (work). In Mac OS X (home) I vacillate between Omniweb and Opera.  In Linux I usually use SuSE and if I need a graphical browser at all there's konqueror.</p>

<p>[1] Yes I do know about the leaner versions of Mozilla like Galeon, Phoenix, Navigator, but they are then usually <b>too</b> cut down in features...</p>

<p>The default Mozilla chrome isn't very nice I'll grant you, but some of the alternatives are very pretty. Opera 6 (Win32) even when skinned always looked a little rough round the edges, and doesn't quite match it. Opera 7 is a slight improvement over 6, which while I don't think it's as pretty as Mozilla yet, it is nicer to look at than IE.</p>

<p>I couldn't agree more regarding speed, Opera is tiny, so it's quick to download, and it starts and runs amazingly fast. I've always liked it's tabbed browsing, which I think is excellent, and it's still better than Mozilla in the usability stakes, but the tabs (on windows) look a little ugly. The new Opera 7 tabs are prettier, and just as functional as before.</p>

<p>Overall I rank Mozilla as prettiest GUI, then Opera 7, then IE 6. Page rendering looks, I'd now have to say that Opera 7 and Mozilla tie, they look so similar, with IE last, and for speed, Opera 7 has to be first, and then IE6 with Mozilla last. Mozilla's "Quick Launch" is okay if you are willing to trade memory for speed.</p>

<p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder as you say, but for the first time in quite a while there is lots of choice, and they are mostly W3C compatible now, so we can (in theory) use what we want - <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/" title="webstandards.org">Web Standards</a webstandards.org>.</p>
