<div class="span8">
<p><p>This summer just before I went away on holiday our IT support team upgraded the <a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP</a> <a href="http://www.webmethods.com/">WebMethods</a> based Bussiness Connector Server that sits between our SAP system and my Apache/Perl front end. Everything seemed to be okay, and there were no problems reported while I was away, and even after I got back.</p>

<p><strong>However</strong> all was not well. WebMethods had upgraded the system quite a bit converting the system from it's previous iso-8859-1 input/output to all new utf-8. As any <a href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode</a> aficionado will tell you the 7-bit ASCII characters in are also the same in iso-8859-1, and utf-8, so most things went through okay without a problem, however the top 128 characters in iso-8859-1 did not....</p>

<p>To fix things I had to re-jig the code, removing the iso to utf-8 conversions on the output stage, the XSL-T engine expected utf-8 anyway, and adding a iso to utf-8 stage on the POST to the business connector. All in all, it actually reduced the amount of code in there, so you can't complain too much.</p>

<p>The only problem I hit was  that LWP when it POSTs data, uses the standard Perl length command to work out long the post is. Perl 5.6.x conveniently conveniently counts characters not bytes/octets, which means when the data is utf-8, it gets the wrong number of octets, truncating the file, and the BC Server's XML parser dies.</p>

<p>My quick hack was to count the length of the file before converting to utf-8, then in a use bytes; block count it again, adding the difference to the end of the file as spaces, which fools LWP. This was the solution I posted to <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=200072">PerlMonks</a>. It's not very elegant, and I don't like it.</p>

<p>I then recalled that I had <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/MSERGEANT/HTTP-GHTTP-1.07/">GHTTP</a> on the box, and I thought I'd give that a try. Matt claims it's a lot faster than LWP, and on the whole I think he is right, but more importantly it was able to POST utf-8 encoded data without a problem, and I was able to fix my code, shorten it and speed it up at the same time.</P>

<p>Anyhow to the moral of the story. When the project was begun many moons ago a more senior Hacker asked if we had any tests, and I sheepishly admitted that we did not. If we had we would have been able to create a fix before the new BC server went into production, and we would have been able to do things at a more measured pace than the current head-long rush.....</p></p>
