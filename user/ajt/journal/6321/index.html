<div class="span8">
<p><p>I confess that I am a <strong>"To Do"</strong> person. There are many things I have to do, and my list seems to grow for ever longer. There is nothing actually stopping me from doing many things on my list, which makes it worse....</p>

<ul>
<li>This first thing I have to do is fix up my web site. For someone employed as a webmaster, my own site is terrible. It's assembled using clunky Apache SSI, it's not 100% valid XHTML1.1, and uses a mix of CSS1/no CSS, and the content is ancient...</li>
<li>I need to make public my simple templating system. It's designed to work for small scale sites, running Apache and CGI-BIN only. For anything other than a very simple site, Matt's <a href="http://axkit.org/">AxKit</a> is clearly a better solution.</a>
<li>I have to do more work on my RSS/RDF module <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=XML-RSS-Tools">XML::RSS::Tools</a>. The problem is that there is an underlying flaw in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=XML-RSS">XML::RSS</a> that isn't going to get fixed with out some re-writing - which is a terrible shame</li>
<li>I've got a lot of good books to read. When I have no TV and Internet access, I can read a good book cover to cover in a typical weekend. Alas I have 24 hour Internet access, since January this year a TV (I lived without TV for several years) plus DVD player, and most importantly I don't live alone any more.</li>
<li>I need to get fit. So far I've made good progress, swimming twice a week, and badminton twice a week. I walk to and from the train station to get to work, so I do a good 4km walking per day. I don't smoke, and I've never drank much in the way of alcohol, but when I go for a bike ride I still come back feeling like death warmed up....</li>
</ul>

<p>I suppose I should do something productive today, especially as my better half is away for the week....</p></p>

While perusing cpan early this morning, I coincidentally came across <i>Set::CheckList</i>.  The description says <i>Keep track of a list of "to do" items</i>.
