<h2>Solution: ettercap</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2005-06-15T23:35:36</h3>
Download and install <a href="http://ettercap.sourceforge.net/" title="sourceforge.net">Ettercap</a sourceforge.net>.  Leave it running in plain sight.  Next time he uses the rlogin protocol, show how ettercap displays his password in the clear.
<p>
I think that'll prove the point.</p>

Yeah, or <a href="http://www.monkey.org/user/dugsong/dsniff/" title="monkey.org">dsniff</a monkey.org>, which was developed exactly for this purpose: to convince a University&#8217;s admins that there&#8217;s a real reason to mandate SSH and retire the r* tools.

<p>I've told him that telnet as root is a really bad idea, I nearly fell out of my chair when I realised he was r* as root, and wanting to use NFS with root enabled. When ever I complain, he says we are behind a firewall and all the SSH stuff is just rubish from Linux - which isn't real Unix anyway....</p>

<p>The real problem is a culture clash. He thinks Linux is a toy, and that SSH/sudo are pains. To him only AIX/Solaris are "real" solutions, and that plain telnet/r tools/wide open X are all you need. To me I use SSH by default, never login as root - only sudo, I don't even install r* tools, and AIX/Solaris are expensive dinosaurs (though useful skills to have on ones CV).</p>

<p>It's not helped by the fact that SAP is a technical dinosaur too, it relies on the r tools, and wide open NFS shares. I think the later versions are more secure, but the one we run is antique.</p>

<p>Ask him how much he is willing to bet that noone will ever break that firewall. Ask him how much he is willing to bet that no user will ever be tempted to sniff for passwords.</p>

<p>Also, both <code>sudo</code> and SSH originate in BSD.</p>

<p>sudo in particular is really, really old (from 1980 &#8211; far older than the Linux kernel, older even than the GNU project).</p>

<p>Solaris ships with both.</p>

<p>Our firewall has Windows notebooks connecting through it via VPN. Personally I consider it to be meaningless, given that remote notebooks cannot be trusted. I believe the firewall even runs on a Windows server, though I could be wrong, so I don't trust in in that respect either.</p>

<p>I know SSH comes from OpenBSD, but to him it's somehow "tainted goods" now it's used on Linux. I didn't know that <tt>sudo</tt> was that old, but he claims it doesn't work properly on AIX 4.x, so he never uses it.</p>

<p>I suppose it mostly as case of "I did it this way a decade ago - why should I change?". Add to this the "If it doesn't have IBM/HP/Sun on the box, it's not worth using" attitude, and you can see why Red Hat on x86 just doesn't seem to cut it.</p>

<p>I can just about get him to accept that BSD is Unix, but only then as a stepping stone to real commercial Unix. I know that the Linux kernel and BSD kernel are different, but an awful lot of the userspace code is now common.</p>

<p>Actually the userspace still differs vastly on the very lowest level (<code>init</code>, the toolbox, and stuff like that). For anything above the bare metal you&#8217;re right, though.</p>

<p>Uhm, the setup running in your place sounds like a disaster waiting to happen. If I was in your shoes, assuming you have any responsibility for any of the systems, I&#8217;d be looking for ways to CYA.</p>

Categorising this as a "disaster waiting to happen" reminds me of a discussion I had recently in the <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/diffrentcolours/574219.html?thread=3297547#t3297547" title="livejournal.com">comments on a friend's Live Journal</a livejournal.com> - IT people seem to be not very good at evaluating risk.

<p>The security (or lack thereof) at ajt's employer doesn't sound any different to what it was two years ago when I started work there (I have since moved on).  There were no major incidents in the year I was there and I think it unlikely that there have been since.</p>

I'm sure I remember your lovely employer having a policy on password use.  I'm quite certain that you can find something suitable in there to bash him over the head with.
