<div class="span8">
<p><p>For most of today, I have been working with an ABAP programmer to try and persuade our evil <a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP</a> system to hold some data for our long delayed web sites. We tried putting the product names in one field then another, only to discover that they came back unordered, or there were arbitrary string length restrictions. To be honest it's not that the SAP system is that terrible, it's just that it's not so flexible, and our implementation is inappropriate for what we are trying to get out of it..... Anyway at the end of the day we managed to get the XML out more or less correct, and I was able to XSLT it up without having to do much to the Perl framework that builds the sites.</p>

<p>I also booked some summer holiday time- we're hoping to go to Tour in the Loire valley of France this July, and I time it correctly I'll take in <a href="http://www.yapc.org/Europe">YAPC::Europe</a> as part of the whole thing.... As barbie <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/barbie/journal/11416">says</a> though the YAPC::Europe site is a bit static at the moment, which is a tiny bit worrying</p></p>

<p>As I answered to Barbie on the yapc-europe mailing list: true, the site is a bit static,
but this will change on monday, when we open
the pre-registration. People will be able to pay for their tickets
in a few weeks.</p>
<p>We have also setup a small band of people ready
to help groups to book their hotels (you we speak
French and we might get a bargain price from
the hotel managers).</p>
<p>We are sorry our silence worried a lot of people. We are going to improve this.</p>
<p>Did I mention we need more talks?</p>

<p>Fair enough!</p>

<p>Which class of talks do you need most? I'll try to think of something to present, I've not had the joy of public speaking for some time...</p>
