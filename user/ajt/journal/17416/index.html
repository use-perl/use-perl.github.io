<p><p>It's not exactly spring yet, but it's so mild in the south of England at the moment that the plants "think" it is, so I thought I should do some "Spring Cleaning".</p>

<p>Sometime ago I upgraded from Windows to Debian at home, and other than one or two minor niggles on the way, it's actually been very painless, and all things considered I think Linux is a fine desktop OS.</p>

<p>As part of the upgrade I burnt an awful lot of stuff to CD-R, and copied things <em>en masse</em> to the Linux file system. As you can imagine there was quite a lot of stuff: some obsolete; some abandoned; and some useful. Yesterday and today I've tried to clean and organise things better.</p>

<p>One of my tasks for this year is to use and understand some form of RCS, so
I imported some live projects into CVS, and it seems to have worked okay. I know that there are lots of arguments about which RCS is the best, and a lot of people bitch about CVS, but it's enough for me for the moment. From my point of view it comes with Debian stable, it works out of the box, and it's good enough
for the moment.</p>

<p>I've made some more tweaks to my <a href="http://iredale.dyndns.org/blog/">Blosxom* blog</a> on the system. It's not a fast system, and the ADSL line is only 256 kb/s out-bound, so I don't expect high speeds.</p>

<p><small>* Did I mention that <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/">Blosxom</a> is very cool. If we had any content on the work's web site, I'd use it there...</small></p></p>
