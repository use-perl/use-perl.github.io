<p><p>I loath badly designed web sites, and the stupid companies that own them - I may have mentioned this before...</p>

<p>Yesterday, I decided to cancel my dial-up ISP account with the UK monster telco "BT", I went through the process using IE, as their site doesn't seem to support modern browsers like Mozilla or Opera, only to be given a message that my account would die in 48 hours, without any additional confirmation. I wouldn't mind but I've paid for a months dial-up, so I would expect it to die at the end of the month, they do have my money already. So I sent them an email, and as usual they have so far ignored it. I hate BT more than almost any other company I've ever had to deal with, they are so bureaucratic and incompetent, that deal with them makes my hair (what's left) go grey!.</p>

<p>My second hate of the day is the UK Internet bank Smile. Today when I tried to access my account with Mozilla it failed with the helpful error message: "Cannot display error page. There has been an error please contact smile. 0870 (The Bank) 843 2265". Of course it works fine with the evil, and very broken browser from the Beast of Redmond, but not with a proper safe and secure browser....</p>

<p>While I'm on the topic of <a href="http://hates-software.com/">hate</a>, how do people use IE? it's such a crap browser. I only use it when forced, and I'm amazed at it's primitive interface: no tabs; no pop-up blocking; no image blacklisting; and it's so slow when compared with Opera and Mozilla. I don't even like to think about it's HTML bugs and security defects.....</p></p>

One thing that makes IE more tolerable is the Google toolbar. http://toolbar.google.com/

<p>I must agree that the Google Toolbar isn't that bad, it adds some functionality to a very broken product. Mozilla and Opera don't really need it, but the <a href="http://googlebar.mozdev.org/" title="mozdev.org">Mozilla</a mozdev.org> "version" works quite well if you really want one.</p>

<p>As good as the Google Toolbar is, it still can't make up for the fact that Microsoft Internet Explorer is a dire browser, riddled with holes, and is one of the weapons MS use to convert open public standards to proprietary standards, to enhance their monopoly.</p>

<p>For example the Eolas court case they lost will probably lead to yet more junk in the XHTML standard. See <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0903c.shtml#eolasfallout" title="zeldman.com">Zeldman.com</a zeldman.com> for more details.</p>
