<p><p>I have nothing against cars made or designed in Germany. I have nothing against Germans, or indeed any other nationality of drivers who own German cars*.</p>

<p><strong>HOWEVER</strong> I do have something against British drivers who choose German cars, particularly luxury German cars. They drive around as if they are in a sports-tank and view other road users as mere obstacles in their plans for solo world domination.</p>

<p>This morning on the way into work, I was proceeding along, crossing the road at a commonly used crossing point. As it happens pedestrians have right of way in most situations anyway, but in this case the crossing point I choose was often used and clearly visible. Some fu*kwit in a large black Audi came out of his drive way, and picked up speed as he approached me, I assume expecting me to leap out of his way. I saw the approaching car, and judging that if he kept his speed constant he would pass behind me without a problem did nothing - I was carrying a 65l rucksac so I wasn't keen to change my speed anyway. As he was acceperating, and I had assumed he would not, he then had to decellerate, and the annoyance of having to slow down for a pedestrian with the right of way was so hard for him to comprehend that he had to blow his horn loudly.</p>

<p>It's an old joke, but indicators and breaks are optional extras on Mercs, BMWs and Audis</p>

<p><small>* This may be a common problem where you live too, but as I don't live there, I don't know.</small></p></p>

This is a common problem everywhere.<br> <br>
Here in southern central Florida, we have many pedestrians (and bike riders) run over every day.<br> <br>
I don't think it really has anything to do with German cars, it just seems that anyone in a new, expensive, luxury car feels that there 'flow' is more important than your life.<br> <br>
