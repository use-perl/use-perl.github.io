<p><p>Though still labouring under the shadow of a miserable cold, I've managed to get a few things done of late.</p>

<p>I've started on a new OO module for fun. It's based on someone else's code, but it's rather fun, and it's a nice learning exercise.</p>

<p>This weekend I started the first phase of my own site upgrade, it's been in the works for nearly 9 months, but has languished through lack of urgency and effort. Other than updating all the HTML to XHTML1.1, and giving the stylesheets a face lift, I've also had my better half proof read the text - which has made a huge difference! The hard part now is to fix the technical side which needs restructuring and a lot of editing. Once it's all done it'll get translated into French...</p>

<p><tt><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/brian_d_foy/">brian d foy</a></tt> and the other members of the <a href="http://perl-rss.sourceforge.net/">Perl RSS</a> team have release XML::RSS 1.x this February. I had to keep up with the changes, as it turned out that 1.00 had a bug so it's now gone to 1.01, just after I updated the site. Next I have to check how my XML::RSS::Tools behaves on top - I think it should be okay, but it needs testing.</p>

<p>On the RSS front Mark Pilgrm has a nice article over on XML.com, called <a href="http://www.xml.com/lpt/a/2003/01/22/dive-into-xml.html">Parsing RSS At All Costs</a>, where he discusses some of the problems with commercial RSS feeds. <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Matts/">Matts</a> wrote his <a href="http://www.xmlhack.com/read.php?item=638">RSS Mirroring Tool</a>, and I use a chunk of it in my XML::RSS::Tools, and I see that the latest XML::RSS does the same. However neither cope with the rubbish that many sites produce, as Mark says <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/">The Register</a> is only usable 2 days per month!</a>

<p>My better half is getting urges to learn something new. She is not happy with her job at the moment, and frankly I'm not happy either, as it's a civil-service job, and it sounds like they couldn't find their own arse even with a map, which means I'm paying for the governments incompetence.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is the village annual litter pick up day. I can't say I'm keen to spend the day in the drizzle removing other people's rubbish, that's what I pay taxes for, but it's a good opportunity to build bridges within the village. The place does look a tip, it's sad to see field boundaries and country lanes with McDonald's rubbish strewn across them, especially as the nearest one is over 12km away.</p></p>
