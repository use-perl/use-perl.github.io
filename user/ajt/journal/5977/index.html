<p><p><strong>NOT ME!</strong></p>

<p>As reported by <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/22/25875.html">The Register</a> half of the US should be using broadband by early 2004, this is effectively in line with Jakob Nielsen's prediction back in 1998, reported in his UseIT column: <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/980405.html">Nielsen's Law of Internet Bandwidth</a>.</p>

<p>In the UK the position is a little different.... BT our resident telco, tenaciously holds on to it's copper monopoly. The UK has one of the poorest levels of local-loop unbundling in Europe, and we have only 60% population coverage with ADSL technology. The position is so bad that some of BT's competitors are considering <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/22/25859.html">legal action</a>.</p>

<p>One ray of sun-light in the seemingly unending fog of dial-up only net access has been the roll out of "no-frills" services, and almost reasonable prices. As prices have fallen, and consumers have been free to choose their own hardware, uptake has risen, and the various ADSL operators are <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/22/25880.html">falling over themselves</a> to sign people up.</p>

<p>However I am not a happy ADSL bunny, for I am in the poor ADSL-have-nots, the 40% of British homes that are not to be offered ADSL connections, for we are not profitable for BT. The village I live in is deemed by BT to be too small for them to profitably install ADSL in the exchange here. So even though I live less than 100m from what seems to be a modern digital exchange I can't have ADSL!</p>

<p>Now you would think that as BT has a monopoly, then as a regulated industry the regulator would oblige them to offer a universal service, but apparently that is not the case either. I wouldn't mind so much if I could choose cable, or fixed-wireless, but neither of these are available either. To rub salt in the wound, dial-up charges have risen by ÃÂ£1(~USD1.50) per month - even if you can't get ADSL!</p>

<p>I'm forced to use a V90 modem, and be happy customer.... Like many other places, we as poor country peasants, are forced to write to our elected representatives, <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/22/25268.html">parade naked though the streets</a> and <a href="http://www.adslguide.org.uk/newsarchive.asp?item=685">beg</a> for mercy from our corporate over-lords.</p>

<p>According to Nielsen the internet <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9703a.html">needs to be fast</a> for good usability, and having just downloaded the latest <a href="http://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a> version I can testify that a V90 modem is not fast!</p>

<p>END RANT...</p>
