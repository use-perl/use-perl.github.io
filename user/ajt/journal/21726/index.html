<p><p>Since our Web application has worked without almost any problem, I'm looking for a new programming challenge. Next week I'm on a Red Hat training course, so I don't want to start anything fancy until I'm back from that.</p>

<p>I've started to play with <a href="http://maypole.perl.org/">Maypole</a>. It's not bad really, the problem is that the Perl.com articles are now woefully out of date, it's all changed since they were written - which caused me no end of pain trying to get it running this morning. A careful read of the POD, and some help from fellow perlmonks has allowed me to get the Beer.DB demo site running - though it's got problems and some of the pages don't work yet.</p>

<p>Should keep my busy for today... I've even got a valid business case for it, a colleague wants a web based "CRUD" interface for a simple task database. Maypole looks perfect for that.</p></p>

If you fancy a challenge, and are interested in Ruby, you could try looking at <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" title="rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a rubyonrails.org>, which appears to be like Maypole, but in Ruby.  I still need to look properly at both...

<p>I don't know Ruby. It's one of those things I think I should know about, but have never had enough time to look into it. Alas there are quite a few things on my list, and I never seem to make any progress...</p>

It seems pretty simple if you've spent more than 5 minutes on Perl OO code, or know a little bit of python.

<p>Coming back to rails though, I <em>loved</em> the <a href="http://media.nextangle.com/rails/rails_setup.mov" title="nextangle.com">demo movie</a nextangle.com> (22Mb, quicktime).
