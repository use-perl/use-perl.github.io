<p><p>Apparently <a href="http://www.esafe.com/">eSafe</a> eats PDFs from redhat.com, as they are obviously SAPM. Our IT guy in head office, says that eSafe is the best thing since sliced bread (which I don't actually like), and that we only get 1% false-positives, compared with the industry average of 5%.</p>

<p>I've no idea what the industry averages are, but I've had one false positive ever at home with spamassassin, and I get a better identification rate too. It's not that I've done anything fancy yet, I'm running a stock Debian Sarge, with spamassassin and simple procmail filtering.</p>

<p>I have no idea how good eSafe really is, but it seems to let through a lot of obvious spam, and eats useful content. My system at home is clearly better, and given that I get more email at home than work, and my home email address has been out on the net for longer, it's just not wishful thinking.</p>

<p>I doubt they will listen to me. For one I'm a "commie European" and can't possible know anything that head office doesn't. There is no way that they will listen to me as a Linux/Unix person with a decade of expereince, a nice man in a suit told them that Windows was all they need...</p>

<p>Me bitter and cynical..? Never........ I have the corporate "Cultural Transition" certificate to prove I'm a well ajusted corporate citizen....</p>
