<p><p>My better half can't get a job. She is a better scientist than I, her English is better than mine, she is a fully qualified secondary school teacher, she is flexible &amp; adaptable and though not an IT professional, is pretty skilled up when it comes to most office IT applications. She can even do web design, and is a very good editor. She still can't get a job.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is that we live in a low-skilled part of the country &mdash; at work I gather we struggle to get skilled engineers, yet if you want an unskilled job, there are more of them than people. However, I fear that the main problem is that she is not English, she is French. People are quite prejudice, and assume she will dash of to France at the drop of a beret.</p>

<p>I am utterly ashamed of the small minded attitude that most of my fellow country persons exhibit. Some of the greatest "Britons" of all time have been foreigners or only first generation immigrants, what is wrong with people?</p></p>
