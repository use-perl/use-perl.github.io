<p><p>When I lived in the US, the only channel worth watching was <a href="http://www.pbs.org/">PBS</a> or listing too was <a href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a>. In particular my favourite programmes were <a href="http://www.prairiehome.org/">A Prairie Home Companion</a> and <a href="http://www.cartalk.com/">Car Talk</a>.</p>

<p>Since moving back to the UK I've missed both programmes, though I have some highlights on CD. In theory you can listen over the Internet, but you need a decent connection, which until recently I didn't have. Yesterday I bothered to install RealPlayer for Linux, and listened to PHC, great! However, to my horror I discovered that CarTalk is Winblows Media Player, so I won't be able to listen to it!</p>

<p>If you live in the US please listen/watch your local NPR/PBS station, if you don't live in the US, then you have to view/listen online.</p>

<h2>Try Crossover</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/VSarkiss/">VSarkiss</a> on 2004-03-07T16:52:50</h3>
<p>I use <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/" title="codeweavers.com"> Crossover</a codeweavers.com> plugin to listen to Windows media on Linux.  Works reall well.  Give it a shot.</p>

<p>My box is a lot under spec. I managed to get Wine to run, and it was okay for VERY simple applications, but not really usable for anything else.</p>

<p>I hear good things about Crossover, but until I have new hardware, I don't think it's a viable option for me.</p>

<h2>mplayer?</h2>

I take it you tried a recent mplayer?<br>

<p>I've not tried MPlayer. It's not in Debian stable, so I've not installed it. I took a peak at the MPlayerHQ web site, so I suppose I could try downloading and building it. It will give my under spec system something to do for a few hours...</p>

<p>I gather MPlayer is quite good, plus it's always a learning experience compiling from scratch...!</p>

If you don't want to compile it yourself, debian packages are made available by Christian Marillat.

Add this line to your sources.list.

<p>I just read that name a minute ago, but alas with no link, so your posting is very timely and most helpful!</p>

<p>I tried, however it Segfaults like mad....!</p>

<h2>There is still satellite, short wave, ...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Bernhard/">Bernhard</a> on 2004-03-07T23:40:05</h3>
For worldwide reception there is still satellite coverage and short wave radio. Unfortunately short wave transmissions seem to be not in AM modulation, but in the bandwidth conserving upper side band. The average short waave radion can't pick that up.<br/><br/>Chances are also that a local station is carrying NPR worldwide, see http://www.npr.org/worldwide/.<br/><br/>CU, Bernhard

<p>I don't have a satellite dish, but I do have a nice Sony short-wave radio - the one I used to listen to the BBC while in the US in fact! So I could give that a try.</p>

<p>I had a look at the NPR worldwide coverage when I was about to leave the US, and didn't see anything at the time, I suppose I should have another look to see if things have changed.</p>

<p>I'm told that the BBC retransmits the odd NPR radio show now and then, and with their many digital channels now, I've probably got a half decent chance of  catching the odd show.</p>
