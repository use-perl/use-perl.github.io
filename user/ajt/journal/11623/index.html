<p><p>This weekend has gone quite well, which makes me suspicious that I have done something horribly wrong and it's going to bite me in the arse when I least expect it!</p>

<ul>
<li>On my home server I implemented a UL/LI based structured <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/menus/demo.html">navigation menu</a>, based on the code and ideas of style guru <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/">Eric Meyer</a>. I use Mozilla mostly so I'm fine with it, but I don't like the fact it doesn't work with Opera 7 or IE6. As it happens it's only a few lines of W3C compliant DOM manipulation code in ECMAscript to make it work.</li>
<li>After that success I then did some work on RSS parsing with XSLT. I worked on my one-sheet-fits-all stylesheet to make it a bit easier to work with. I really hate the fact the RSS people couldn't agree, and have created two quite divergent structures, and scattered differing namespaces all over the place - makes XSLT a real pain. Anyhow it's a bit easier now to change the result structures, even if the rest of the sheet is a bit verbose. I'll work the results into the docs of the next release of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/ATRICKETT/XML-RSS-Tools-0.09/">XML::RSS::Tools</a>.</li>
<li>Today we went round the parish looking at the hedges. We are involved in the parish biodiversity group, so we are going to do a hedgerow study this summer. It was nice and sunny this morning, and we covered just over two 1x1km grid boxes in just over 2 hours.</li>
<li>The bread-machine is at the moment baking a hot-cross loaf. I don't know how it's going to turn out, but the picture in the magazine looked very good, so we thought we should give it a go.</li>
</ul></p>

I'm using Mozilla 1.3 (1.3-4 via debian package) and only the lists on the base menu.  When I navigate to sub menus and click on lists nothing happens.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(
