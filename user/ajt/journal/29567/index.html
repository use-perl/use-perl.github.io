<div class="span8">
<p><p>Yesterday evening I was doing some DHTML. Nothing fancy just basic stuff. I normally use Firefox+WebDeveloper to develop with, then Konqueror and Opera for testing. IE is so crap I don't even bother with it, until I've got it all working in the better browsers first. Yesterday was a very frustrating, because I failed to read the error message that was staring me in the face! As soon as I bothered to read the error message it was obvious what I had done wrong, and trivial to fix.</p> 

<p>Now it's all working, I'll see what horrible things IE does with it... While IE is the dominant browser with 60-80% market share in the target demographic, it's no use to develop with, and more importantly it doesn't run directly on Linux which is my desktop and server OS.</p></p>

You were talking about having to resort to Windows to test your sites in IE - well, now there's no need.<br/><br/>The tool at <a href="http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/en/instructions/" title="tatanka.com.br">http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/en/instructions/</a tatanka.com.br> allows you to run IE6, 5.5 and 5.0 using Wine.<br/><br/>It seems to work well on FC5, anyway.

<p>I hadn't seen this particular project, but I knew you can in theory run IE on wine. In my case I run NT inside a QEMU session, which is good enough for testing, but it's a pain for development.</p>

Have you seen the <a href="http://joehewitt.com/software/firebug/" title="joehewitt.com">firebug</a joehewitt.com> extension?  It's like the JavaScript console and DOM inspector all rolled into one.  I can't live without it these days.

<p>Also, when you do get around to debugging under IE, don't forget to install the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Script_Debugger" title="wikipedia.org">Microsoft  Script Debugger</a wikipedia.org>.  It's <em>slightly</em> better than the default dialog box which just says "an error occurred somewhere but I'm not going to tell you where".

<p>Cool, I'll have to give that a try. I'm already running:</p>

<li>Adblock</li>
<li>NoScript</li>
<li>Web Developer</li>
<li>View Source Chart</li>
<li>View formatted source</li>
<li>Tabbrowser extension</li>

When you check it out, go through a few posts on <a href="http://joehewitt.com/" title="joehewitt.com">http://joehewitt.com/</a joehewitt.com> .  There's a number of useful tips on how to get the most out of it.

<p>Okay will do, I'm impressed already!</p>

<p>This sure is one very useful tool. Firefox is a fine foundation for building a really useful cross-platform web development tool on.</p>
