<p><p>This week has been a tad stressful at work. So far I've had to run the 1km from work to the train station each day because I've left later than normal. I've just been doing to many things at once...</p>

<ul>
<li>Working with the marketing department on the new web site - a painful process at best, but now with added Trans-Atlantic delay in the thought process.</li>
<li>Installing a new CVS server for R&amp;D.</li>
<li>Doing lots of SAP stuff for a new plant.</li>
<li>Preparing for a Desaster/Recoverery exercices for SAP.</li>
<li>Transistioning from the SAP BASIS to the SAP ABAP team.</li>
<li>And the SAP BASIS team leader left yesterday!</li>
</ul>

<p>So I'm working from home tonight, again...</p></p>

<p>Can't you at least give R&amp;D Subversion?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>There are lots of (free) choices for revision control systems these days and I'm not suggesting svn is the best choice for all, or even most situations.  But there are precious few reasons for installing CVS.  Most users will pick up all they need to know to switch from CVS to Subversion in less than 10 minutes.</p>

<p>I'm just the monkey, not the organ grinder! When I asked about CVS on my LUG email list, no one defended it, everyone suggested something else. Given that I work for a Windows shop, CVS on Linux is a step in the right direction, even if it's small. They are getting a brand new box within the year, migrating to something more modern is a possibility at that point, at the moment it's CVS on Linux or CVS on Windows.</p>

On Windows, <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" title="tigris.org">TortoiseSVN</a tigris.org> makes SVN even more worth going with than CVS. Although TSVN is based on <a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/" title="tortoisecvs.org">TortoiseCVS</a tortoisecvs.org>. I sympathise with the organ grinder comment, though. I'm still trying to get my company to migrate from our archaic VCS that nobody likes anyway (its partly a question of whether to go with SVN or wait for MS's newfangled VCS...and I'm not in charge of the decision).

<p>We may try a Subversion/TortoiseSVN trial, but I fear that work is too convervative. We make medical devices, and we don't change much - the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality permeates everything. Sometimes you know that there could be a better solution, but managment is cautious...</p>
