<p><p>After a long and tedious week, I was <a href="~DrHyde">invited</a> along to this weeks <a href="http://london.pm.org/">London.pm</a> tech meeting. Given that it was pure luck that I went to this meeting, it was very interesting from my point of view.</p></p>

<p>Why?</p>
<p>Or, more helpfully</p>
<ol> <li>What did you find interesting about it - what weren't you expecting?</li>
<li>As a newcomer, what do we do right?</li>
<li>What could we do better? For bonus points, how?</li>
<li>Did you expect the Spanish Inquisition?</li>

<p>Oh, hard questions...</p>

<ol>
<li>I was interested in the multi-ligual stuff, as I work for a company with lots of language problems, and that was interesting to hear about. Ponie was interesting, but at this stage I thought it was really well presented, as there isn't much to talk about yet - if you see what I mean. I like XML, so anything about XML is interesting, even if I know it already. The MP3 stuff was interesting as I like the problem, and I liked other stuff too.</li>
<li>I thought the presentations were well organised, and you could see the screen. There was food, which was nice to have.</li>
<li>I don't know anyone except by their online existance, so it's very intimidating as I know no one in reality. Someone else also expressed feelings of trepidation in not knowing anyone. While I hate having to stand up and introducing myself, a welcoming committee, of people who take turns in introducing people, could be a nice idea. I've found that in general as long as your not a rude idiot, people in Perl seem to be very helpful and friendly on line, however it's easy in a group where everyone knows everyone to appear to be a <em>clique</em>. So if I had not had positive e-experiences I would say it was an intimidating expereience, but because I've <em>spoken</em> to people before, I know not to be put off and persist until I can put faces to names.</li>
<li>No, but nobody expectes the Spanish Inquisition....!</li>
</ol>

Had I know you were there, I would have said hello, but I didn't spot any <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=113686" title="perlmonks.org">stone archways</a perlmonks.org> lingering with intent<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
<p>
One of the nice things when I do get down to London.pm meetings, is there is always someone I've met online who I get to meet in person. This time around it was <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Dom2/" title="perl.org">Dom2</a perl.org>, a very nice chap.

Hopefully you'll be well enough to make it to YAPC::Europe. Just look for the noisiest bunch of reprobates, that'll be London.pm<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>

<p>Since I put my back out I feel like a stone archway.... stiff and bent over.</p>

<p>Yes I know it's a lame picture, but it's vaguely monastic, and I hate having my picture taken...... If I could find a decent picture of me, I'd stick it on PM or my YAPC page, however the best ones are also the least useful from a recognition point of view...!</p>

I have to confess mines pretty awful, but seeing as several people have managed to figure out who I am when attending Birmingham.pm meetings, it's been useful at least.

Dodging the tomatoes is another matter.</p>
