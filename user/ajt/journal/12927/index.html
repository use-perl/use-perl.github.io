<p><p>I must be missing something, but I'm not having fun changing the docs of my <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/ATRICKETT/XML-RSS-Tools-0.13_2/">XML::RSS::Tools</a> module from HTML to POD. There is probably something out there explaining how it works, and I'll probably be feel very stupid when I find it, but at the moment it seems somewhat elusive.</p>

<p>I have a number of example files, and additional documents, saved as "Unix" format files, in pod with a .pod extension. CPAN doesn't index them the way I had expected, so I must be doing something very stupid. The first time round I thought it was because some of the files had Windows line endings, but that's been fixed, and CPAN still gets it wrong.</p>

<p>I've looked on CPAN in a few places, but I can't find the page that tells me how to include pod files in a module. It must be possible I've looked at modules that have done it, and tried to copy.</p>

<p>Perl/CPAN is great, but sometimes I feel lost in the magnitude of it all.</p></p>

<p>out of the head section that the indexer parses as the title or put it last and it should likely index the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/doc pod properly. You might also use Torgox's fine <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/SBURKE/Pod-HTML2Pod-4.04/HTML2Pod.pm" title="cpan.org">html2pod</a cpan.org>.</p>

<p>I knew there had to be some easy wasy of doing this. Will give it a try!</p>

<p>The HTML 2 POD tool looks interesting, but as I've converted everything to POD already, it's not as exctiting, but it's well worth knowing about, and I can still give it a go if I need it.</p>
