<p><p>This week has been a week of upgrading various machines at work and home. My first challenge was to install RedHat 7.1 on a HP DL360 machine at work. Installation was amazingly quick and I thought quite painless. I then connected to RedHat to upgrade things, a few MB later, and the box was upgraded to zero errata status. Annoyingly I upgraded the kernel, but not lilo, so it wasn't happy when I restarted it... Thankfully there was another kernel on it, so I was able to boot it to that one, and sort lilo out.</p>

<p>My second challenge was a pair of HP DL360s already in use and running RedHat 7.2. On one machine I was able to coerce the RPMs on to it, and get it also upgraded to zero errata. What I can't figure out on this machine is how to get the new kernel to run, it should be running GRUB, but that doesn't seem to do anything, and it still has lilo on it....</p>

<p>The second running DL360 has been more of a pain, I've upgraded more than 100 packages on it, so it's a lot better than before, but I've still got a few to go, and a few to remove (were using hand built stuff on it). I can't fiddle with it's kernel as I can't take it off line to do all the rebooting either.</p>

<p>My home machine is a much smaller affair, just an old P133 with RedHat 6.0 machine. I didn't have much to do on it, just upgrade glibc and the kernel. Annoyingly OpenSSH then refused to run with compression and privilege separation, and it now pauses waiting for a key press when the realtime clock starts during the boot sequence....</p>

<p>Plenty of fun, though a lot less than the chaos the Windows BLASTER worm is causing. My next machine will be ordered soon, once I've had ADSL installed, and decided what to buy: PowerMac G5 or Intel/Linux box......</p></p>
