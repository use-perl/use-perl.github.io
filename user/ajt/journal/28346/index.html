<i>I've finished my week long IBM AIX training course. A very interesting experience. AIX is so different from anyother UNIX that a course that just covers it's unique attributes is very useful.
</i>
<p>
AIX and HPUX are both very different from all other unices, but in similar ways for similar reasons.   Both were early attempts at making Unix IT-friendly (e.g., SMITy) which are to some extent  captive to the installed base.  What I miss most on AIX is POSIX ACEs<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... AIX was an early adopter of ACLs, and the CMW ACLs that AIX has don't include inheritable default ACEs that Solaris, Linux and other POSIX ACE implementations have<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(

</p><p> Have you found the Unix Command Line <a href="http://bhami.com/rosetta.html" title="bhami.com">Rosetta Stone </a bhami.com> web page?   It's your polyglot Hungarian Phrase Book.

</p><p>I rather enjoy AIX at $DayJob, but it sure does scare the Solaris refugees.
</p><p>What are you doing with AIX? Programming, Sysadmin, ? [I'm doing "Architechture", which means I tell the programmers what not to do, and the sysadmins what the programmers' requests really mean<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)]</p>

<p>I knew that AIX was an early Unix fork. I suppose it's trying to be friendly. SMITty isn't bad for tasks you do infrequently, but for common stuff it does get in the way.</p>

<p>The Unix Rosetta Stone was mentioned on the course - everyone was converting/cross training from another Unix - so that proved most useful. I'd seen it before along time ago but forgotten about it.</p>

<p>We run our SAP ERP system on AIX/Informix with Linux application servers. I'm part of the tiny team that looks after the H/W, Unix and SAP BASIS side of things. I'm quite happy with the Linux on PC side and SAP BASIS isn't too hard, but AIX was a bit weird so that was this winter's training.</p>

<p>Most attempts at "friendly" are power-user hostile.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-/  The "lswhatever" commands are the commandline frequent/scriptable hooks that I use with SSH magic and Perl.

AIX (or HPUX) as a monoculture in the datacenter is pretty nice, once you get over the culture shock. Jumping back and forth between Linux, Solaris and AIX is confusing until you get situational reflexes; I'm doing that too.  Hopping between Linuxes is much easier.

</p><p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>smitty isn't too bad, at least it only builds commands from the real tools, so you can see what it's about to do. On the whole I agree that a lot of these kind of automated tools do make your life harder as you gain more experience.</p>

<p>I can see that living in an all AIX woruld would be nice. Alas I work in a 99% Windows world. I'm getting a happier at switching between Linux and AIX, now that understand AIX better.</p>
