You MUST go and get a copy of JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA, at least for the trial period.<br><br>If you can't pay after that, then you move down to Eclipse.<br><br>That is all.

<p>In lieu of paying IntelliJ (which I'd do myself, but my employer did it for me), you can hook up with an open source project and actively contribute. Jetbrains offers a free license for open source authors which quite a few of the Jakarta and OpenSymphony folks (among others) seem to have taken advantage of. </p>

<h2>it's pretty straightforward</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lachoy/">lachoy</a> on 2006-02-21T03:40:53</h3>
<p>Java is actually a pretty simple language. If you haven't done it before threading can be a little tricky, but 1.5 offers a number of useful abstractions to make it easier. It's learning the libraries that's the hard part -- not because they're difficult, just because it takes a while.</p>

<p>I learned from "Thinking in Java", which is verbose but not bad. If you've got OO stuff and Java's type system down, the introduction in Flannagan's "Java in a Nutshell" is terse but IMO excellent. Once you've got a bit under your belt pick up Bloch's "Effective Java". Then load up one of the better open source projects in IDEA and browse away. (There's no CPAN, but there's a ton of open source Java.)</p>

<p>Additionally, Sun has a heap of tutorials on their site that are at least decent. Be warned that a lot of other tutorials on the web have a heavy focus on applets and Swing programming which may be near-useless if you concentrate on server-side stuff.</p>

To my mind, part of the problem with learning Java's libraries is the fact that they're so massively over-engineered.  And they seem to rewrite, trying to throw out the old versions quite frequently.  Except that they can't, as they need to keep the old bits for backwards compatibility (e.g.  Vector vs ArrayList?).

<p>Ok, I'll admit.  I've been toying with Java since it first came out.  I <em>still</em> don't understand I/O in the standard library, above <code>System.out.println()</code>.  It's a complete mess.  But I can usually look up in a reference to see what's going on.  But what really bugs me is the bizarre and opaque behaviour of things like UrlConnection, in which you have to write to a stream to set the body of a POST request.  Sure, you might need to do that someday, but 99% of the time you just want to say "setContent()", like in HTTP::Request.

</p><p>The language itself is reasonably simple to learn, although because it's so simple, I find it to be far more difficult to express concepts in clearly, relative to Perl.

</p><p>That said, there are some <em>really</em> nice bits of Open Source Java.  My favourite example is <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/" title="apache.org">Lucene</a apache.org>, which you should consider any time you need to do searching.

<p>The IO approach is very un-Perlish, but it does eventually make sense and it enables some fairly nifty behavior. For instance, with the URLConnection you can assign a String, you just need to wrap it in a StringReader/InputStreamReader first. Klunky? Yes. But it also allows you to wrap it in a ZipInputStream to do automatic compression, or an EncryptedInputStream (sp?) to encrypt it. </p>

<p>That points out my major beef with the Java libraries: they don't make easy things easy. With the URLConnection, they <b>should</b> have a method to just set a string as content, then do the stuff I mentioned behind the scenes. Another instance: what's the primary thing someone wants to do with a zip file? Unpack it to a filesystem! Is there a method to do that? <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/news/display/1004" title="cwinters.com">Of course not!</a cwinters.com> So everyone winds up writing their own shortcuts and having to maintain them, package them, depend on them, etc. (Many of the libraries in the Jakarta Commons are like this.)</p>

That's <em>exactly</em> the point I was trying to make.  Java manages to miss out on making simple things easy by a large distance.

<p>Thanks for the suggestions.</p>

<p>Depending upon how things go I'll be doing SAP Java/ABAP work as part of SAP AG's NetWeaver technology. It's all horribly bespoke and notoriously slow and buggy, but it's where the money is...</p>

<h2>I'd kill for a perl to java dictionary</h2>

I have also been learning Java, and the biggest problem I have is saying...  "In perl I'd use a dispatch table to solve this problem, i wonder how you do that in java".  Also a guide to the galaxy of Struts, Hibernate, Spring, Forms, Avalon, Pico... all these frameworks which are as far as I can tell the sorts of modules I'd look for on CPAN.  but I can't tell what they do by the name they are called and so knowing each is for would help a lot with selecting the right tool for the job.

<p>That's part of thinking in a language. It took me a while to stop using Maps everywhere<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>Regarding the dispatch table: one standard practice is to use a Map and make the values implement a particular interface, like 'Executable'. Then you can do something like this:</p> <blockquote> <div><tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; String dispatchKey = getDispatchKey(...);<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; if ( dispatchTable.containsKey( dispatchKey ) ) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Executable dispatched =<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Executable)dispatchTable.get( dispatchKey );<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dispatched.execute();<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; else {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; throw new IllegalArgumentException( "Cannot dispatch " + dispatchKey );<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }</tt></div> </blockquote> <p>With the generics in 1.5 you don't need to do the cast, which is handy.</p>
