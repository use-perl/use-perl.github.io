<p><p>My progress to anything other than very expensive narrow-band is slow...</p>

<p>This week the monster telco/ISP decided that it's Anytime package was too generous, upping the price by ÃÂ£1 (&euro;/$ 1.5) per month this summer wasn't enough, so they capped the hours at 150 hours per month. Strange meaning of anytime, I suppose they mean, any-time you want, just not for very long.</p>

<p>They also cap their ADSL service at 1Gb per day, and apparently only two active socket pairs at a time - I have to investigate that last one.</p>

<p>The satellite outfit in the village got some coverage in <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/22/27491.html">The Regsiter</a> this week, apparently they were miffed about not being mentioned in an earlier article on the same topic.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.spten.co.uk/">sPten</a>, the other local operator has been silent of late, so no movement on that front. Their web site is full of errors and broken links. <a href="http://www.libertybroadband.co.uk/">Liberty Broadband</a> (previously Tele2), another fixed-wireless operator, however secured <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/22/27514.html">extra funding</a>, and are also offering a partnership deal for rural communities that looks interesting too.</a>

<p>As frustrating as this all is, the UK's e-Minister <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/28/27518.html">doesn't have</a> broadband, even though he lives in an area with both cable and DSL. No wonder the UK is unwilling to invest in a proper <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/22/27515.html">fibre infrastructure</a>.</p>
