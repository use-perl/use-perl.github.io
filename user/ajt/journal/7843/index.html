<p><p>I was reading <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/">The Register</a>, as one does over lunch, when I spotted this article: <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/22/27194.html">Rural Hants could get wireless broadband</a>. Seeing as I live in rural Hants, and have no chance of ADSL or cable, this seemed like an interesting story.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell <a href="http://www.sp10.co.uk/">sPten</a> are using fixed-wireless technology, typically based on the technically superior, but commercially dead, Qualcomm CDMA system. Basically they put up a mobile (cellular) phone mast on top of a hill. You have a mains operated phone bolted to the roof of your house, and the box of tricks converts a CDMA signal into a nice 10MBit RJ-45 presented ethernet feed.</p>

<p>I could have a symmetrical 128k connection for ÃÂ£10/month ($15/month), which is less than I pay for a 56k dial-up! The only snag is that our village is right on the edge of the current coverage.....</p>

<p>Though not as interesting <a href="http://www.satdrive.com/">SatDrive</a> have opened an office opposite my house. This technology isn't as friendly, as it's very expensive, very asymmetric, and doesn't run on Linux, Mac, or NT - you have to have 98/Me/2K/XP.</p></p>
