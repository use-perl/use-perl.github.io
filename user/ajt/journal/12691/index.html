<p><p>I've found a new toy to play with. Ever since <a href="~davorg">davorg</a> mentioned the <a href="http://londongeek.org/">London Geek</a> wiki I've been playing with Brian "ingy" Ingerson's <a href="http://www.kwiki.org/">CGI::Kwiki</a>. I've seen wiki's before, but never bothered with them, though I did start to get interested when I read Brian's recent article on Perl.com "<a href="http://www.perl.com/lpt/a/2003/05/14/kwiki.html">CGI::Kwiki</a>", it looks like a very useable technology for <strong>some</strong> applications.</p>

<p>Since my PC at work died recently I had a new install of Perl 5.8 and Apache 2, so it seemed like a good idea to install it, before I added all sorts of cruft to the box. Of course the tests fail, Windows 2K just isn't like a *nix box, so I had to do some messing to get the tests to pass, and to convince myself it was worth carrying on. Once I figured out what was actually going on in the test phase (actually very little) I was able to set it up on my box. It works like a charm on Windows, even runs well under mod_perl, so I'm very happy.</p>

<p>A while ago <tt>brian d foy</tt> asked about Perl applications, <a href="~brian_d_foy/journal/9974">here</a> and followed up <a href="~davorg/journal/10096">here</a>. I think Brian's Kwiki is a good example, for although it's easy to modify at the Perl level, it also has a HTML and CSS level, so you can install and tweak it with almost no Perl knowledge at all, making it a good end user application.</p>

<p>The HTML and CSS used in CGI::Kwiki is a bit of a mix, but with a little effort it's easy enough to convert it properly into nice XHTML1.1 and to move all the presentational stuff out into the style sheets. I've sent Brian some ideas, we shall see if I've talked my self into another job....</p>

<p>If you haven't got a wiki, and you want a simple one, I gather that there is also the industrial strength CGI::Wiki, then take a look at CGI::Kwiki, a new version even came out today...!</p></p>
