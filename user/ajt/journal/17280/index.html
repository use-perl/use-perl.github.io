<p><p>I seem to have been sucked into <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Profile.aspx?uid=9412665265854586839">orkut</a>.</p>

<p>The site is MS based, something fairly alien to Google, and has had a fair degree of critisism for not being very stable as a result. I have no idea if any of the critisism is fair, but it has kept <a href="http://www.theregister.com/">The Register</a> entertained for a few nano seconds.</p>

<p>So far I've been impressed with the rendering speed of the site, my systems at home are all very under-powered, and many sites just take to long to render, but orkut seems to come up quite quickly.</p>

<p>Other than the obvious of not being too graphicaly heavy, it's doesn't have clean modern xhtml, it's quite old fashioned and a bit messy. In fact some people have pointed out that the mark-up <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/buzz/archive/2004_02.html#a000287">fails the most basic of accessability</a> tests. While badly written sites, with excessive graphics, and broken Javascript are the norm, you would think an all new site, with Google's name on it would be better....</p>

is so many people who are concerned with privacy giving away all this information for free whereupon google can and likely will sell it to governments and commercial interests. There are quite a few companies who wisely forbid employees from participating in this sort of information giveaway.

Everything in my profile that is either already public knowledge, or random trivialities which I am amused at having in my profile, or sarcastic untruths.<br> <br>As far as giving away ideas in community forums, I can't say I've seen one forum yet that had a serious discussion going on except the "What Should Orkut Do" bitchfest (so many Jerkcity references though!).<br> <br>Orkut is just a bunch of nerds running around in a Google-hosted playpen.

Orkut is just a bunch of people who seem to have never left highschool judging by the whole pointless cliqueish masturbation of it all. If you like about your identity, it makes it even more pointless. I would guess that orkut also is able to acces the google and amazon cookies in your browser which are likely to provide a lot more information.

Well, yeah, but TIA already took all my info and said it was "well protected".  Do you mean that I shouldn't trust large organizations interested in money and power?

Well, always remember that it is not what you know, rather who you know that gets you where you are going in life. Think about that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
