<p><p>Yesterday I struggled with OpenSSH on my NT4/Cygwin box at home. After several partial successes, I managed to get the SSH demon running, and allow me to log-in from either of the Unix boxen at home, accept the certificate, and log me in as the correct person, with the correct environment!</p>

<p>Today we decided to do the bicycle trip round the village we had aborted before. Everything went well, it was nice and sunny, and there was little or no traffic. Things didn't last though, after a gentle 1km climb up a dirt track I arrived at the top where my better half has stopped to have a drink and check the map. I stopped, and had just enough time to say "I feel faint" before the my rising body temperature was enough to knock me out. Ironically if I'd have carried on I would have been okay.</p>

<p>Alas when I hit the dirt, my glasses took a chunk our of my nose, and I chopped a piece out of my thumb. After a few minutes I was okay to cycle home, but we decided that the wounds were quite dirty, so we had better go to the local A&amp;E. After 3 hours wait in a hot waiting room we saw a doctor who decided that the wounds needed cleaning, and to relive the pain of the process I'd have a local anaesthetic. Suffice to say that hurt so much that I nearly passed out, so one tranquiliser later, he tried again in a different place, which didn't hurt. How I've a very bruised and bloody nose, and a very numb thumb......</p>

<p>Typing is actually quite difficult, so I'm off for dinner now, and an early night.</p></p>

I don't wish to increase your pain, but this is a pet peeve...<br> <br>It's <b> <em>Lose</em><nobr> <wbr></nobr></b>.<br> <br>You loose a knot. You lose your mind.<br> <br>Consider yourself corrected<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<p>I'd claim it was the pain killers, tranquilisers and anaesthetic, but it's probably just the dyslexia.....</p>

<p>Still can't feel my thumb, and it's over three hours since we got home... Typing is still awkward!</p>

<p>The scary thing is that I'd <b>already</b> journaled about this very subject a while back: <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/WebDragon/journal/11823" title="perl.org">WebDragon's Journal 11823</a perl.org> </p>
