<p><p>
The UK government is currently trying to drum up hysteria to justify some stupid and unnecessary laws and freedom restrictions<sup>*</sup>. Part of the spin is a massive waste of money on an official "Preparing For Emergencies" booklet, that is being sent to every household in the country, Naturally there is an official web site, to add to the waste of tax money.
</p>

<p>
One enterprising chap has created his own version of the site. It is a perfectly valid satire of the official site, and reflects the cynicism that many people feel towards this latest example of government spin. Needless to say the site has been overloaded, and the government has got heavy handed - adding to the validity of the criticism/parody.
</p>

<p>
Unless HM Government has bullied him off the Internet, or his server
has collapsed under the load, have a look at <a href="http://www.preparingforemergencies.co.uk/">www.preparingforemergencies.co.
uk</a>.
</p>

<p>
Interestingly the Governments <a href="http://www.preparingforemergencies.gov.uk/">official</a> web site fails automated accessability tests, and is therefore in breach of the government's own Disability Discrimination Act...
</p>

<p><small>
* I know that terrorism is serious, and I wish no harm to anyone, however many people feel that our government has been milking the current international siuation, to allow it to ram through legislation that would otherwise be blocked.
