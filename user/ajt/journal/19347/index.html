<p><p>This week the already excellent Mozilla.org Firefox and Mozilla have all moved up another point with the release of the 0.9 and 1.7 versions.</p>

<p>This release will probably represent the crossover from Mozilla to Firefox for me at work. There were a few things that Mozilla could easily configure that were a bit more hidden in Firebox, but that's no longer the case. For a while I'd mostly being running Firefox, now I think that will be the standard position from now on.</p>

<p>Annoyingly Mozilla.org have only released GTK2 binaries of Firefox, so I can't run Firefox 0.9 at home on my Debian stable system, it only has GTK1.2, and even adding GTK2, leaves too many libraries that are too old a version to make it run. (I will eventually get a new box at home, and run something like Debian unstable/testing on it.)</p>

<p>It's quite painful watching people using the an inferior browser like IE, these days, modern browsers like Firefox, Safari/Konqueror and Opera are so massively more advanced. Watching IE users gives me a "quaint and rustic" feeling, it's like watching someone struggling on a rickety old ox-cart, as you waft pass them in a Rolls-Royce.</p></p>

what I really miss is the Mozilla Form Manager.

<p>Yes, it's the little things that Mozilla has that Firefox doesn't, that have held me back. I'm not interested in the Mail/News Composer part of the Mozilla Suite, but there have been small things the Mozilla could do that Firefox couldn't.</p>

<p>The main reason I've been running Firefox 0.8 rather than Mozilla 1.6 at work is that since I installed Firefox on that machine Mozilla bacame quite unstable. I've now got latest version of both and they are both stable, but I think I'm leaning in favour of Firefox now.</p>

<p>At home I have Mozilla 1.0.0 and Firefox 0.8 on my Debian box, of the two Firefox is by far the more acomplished. The older version of Konqueror that comes with stable isn't worth using, though compared with IE it's actually a good browser. I would conisder using a more recent version when I upgrade my systems.</p>

<p>I'm now recommending Firefox over Mozilla on any platform, though I still suggest Opera, it's a fine browser too. I tell everyone, including Windows users to install a proper browser and to only use IE under extreme duress.</p>
