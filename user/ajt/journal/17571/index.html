<h1>CD Singles To Die</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>Apparently CD Singles are in the process of leaving this mortal turntable, for the duke box in the sky. Various <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/54/35737.html">retailers</a> are removing them from sale to use the retail space for something that they can actually sell.</p>

<p>Maybe I missed something, but I didn't actually know that CD Singles still existed, though I know the technology was available once. When CDs launched I remember seeing singles, as oddities that they tried to sell cheap, full length CDs were - and still are - too expensive. I never bought a CD single, I've only ever bought full length CDs, I thought that singles had been such a failure that they had been withdrawn a decade ago!</p>

<p>Apparently this death is the result of evil cyber-pirates stealing the songs from the poor record companies, and giving it away to the rich consumers in the form of MP3s.</p>

<p>I'm not in favour of theft or unlicensed duplication, but I don't think the odd CD duplicated or the odd MP3/Ogg is a worry. Rather the massive factories churning out millions of counterfeit CDs and DVDs outside the reach of the law, is a bit more of a problem. If real CDs and DVDs were cheaper, then most people wouldn't bother copying them or buying counterfeit versions, they'd just buy the real thing, because it's easier.....</p>

<h2>B Sides &amp;amp; Rarities</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barbie/">barbie</a> on 2004-02-23T16:28:44</h3>
Singles (CD and vinyl) in the UK have been a big source for previously unavailable songs, or rarities as they are sometimes referred to on bootlegs and occasional rarities collections. Many songs by todays pop bands usually just feature endless pointless remixes. However, since the advent of the independant labels in the early 70s, many bands started adding tracks that didn't make the album, or were interesting covers, or live tracks.
<p>
I think Genesis were perhaps one of the first to release a single, I Know What I Like, with an previously unavailable b-side, Twilight Alehouse, back in 1973. The Jam were notorious for releasing A-sides as well as classic b-sides (Butterfly Collector comes to mind) unavailable on their albums. These days the likes of A Perfect Circle, Pearl Jam, REM, together with a whole host of indie bands, are still carrying on the tradition.
</p><p>
I still think in the majority of cases, the record industry has shot themselves in the foot. The rock &amp; indie singles generally sell well among the fan base, as they know their getting value for money. Most pop singles rarely have anything of worth beyond the lead track (assuming the lead track has any worth!), and many would rather buy the album, as they'd rather pay &#163;12.99 for 10 tracks than &#163;3.99 for 1 track. You'll probably find that its only the likes of Woolworths, WHSmiths, etc that'll be removing the CD single from their shelves. Most independant shops will still feature them.</p>

<p>I see where you are coming from. I can't agree more that the big labels have boxed themselves into a corner, and are turing to anything as a scape goat.</p>

<p>I will happily buy a CD, either as a singe or album, if I know that there is something on it that I want. I've not bought a music CD of an artist/group that I've not got an existing CD from, for quite a while now. I know this narrows my horizons quite a bit, but I'm not prepared to waste &#163;14 on the drivel that the big companies are churning out.</p>

<p>I have enough CDs: classical; rock/pop and audio books, that I don't feel the need to listen to music on the radio. Plus radio is mostly full or commercials, rubbish* or both. I know that there are good stations out there, and good programmes, but they are in the minority.</p>

<p> <strong>Good luck to the independents!</strong> </p>

<p>* I don't mean things I don't like, I mean RUBBISH!</p>

<p>Have you considered using some of those nasty pirate software things like Kazaa to find new bands?  I've found quite a few artists online who I'd have never have even heard of, and have since bought their wares.</p>

<p>Funny that. All the evidence suggests that P2P sharing <em>increases</em> sales of CDs to the users of the P2P network - you would think the big companies would all be in favour of sharing...</p>

<p>P2P is like radio, it's probably a good way to expand your horizons, but I don't have enough motivation or time at the moment. Assuming 8 hours per day it would take me well over a month to listen to my current catalogue of CDs. I already don't listen to my CDs enough, because other things compete for my time, so adding in P2P/radio doesn't help.</p>
