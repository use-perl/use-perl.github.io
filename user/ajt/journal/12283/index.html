<p><p>I <strong>like</strong> Perl and I like the <strong>people</strong> who use Perl! This week has been a good example of how strong and friendly Perl is as a place.</p>

<p>On Perlmonks there was a question about <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=258558">HTTP clients</a>. Recently I've been playing with HTTP clients, and I was able to pass a minor comment into the discussion. As a result of other comments <a href="http://www.piersharding.com/">Piers</a> has worked some changes into his module taking into account the comments. It's taken him less than 72 hours to get the changes up to CPAN.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I passed a comment about testing in my journal. I got several helpful comments, and even some comments on how PPMs are built - always useful to know. This morning I even had a useful message from <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=5348">Corion</a> about including a HTTP server as part of the test suite in my Perlmonks in-box-node.</p>

<p>While preparing breakfast this morning the penny finally dropped, and I figured out what I was doing wrong in my Tests. So I've rewritten the tests, increasing their number a little, and greatly reducing the number of lines of code....</p>

<p>Thanks to <strong>EVERYONE!</strong></p></p>

Nope, still not used to their being another Piers in the Perl community. There was me thinking "I don't remember doing... oh!"
