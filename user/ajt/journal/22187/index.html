Install 'yum'. Your life will be _so_ much better.

I'm not 100% neutral here, but yum has at least a bad reputation among installers.
You might want to look at <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/rafael/journal/22170" title="perl.org">smart</a perl.org> which I blogged about yesterday. It handles RH repository formats.

<p>I did read your journal yesterday, and I have been thinking about something better than RPM, since trying to do a freshen on our new RedHat Enterprise 3 box. In the end I've managed to get all the bits on the box updated. For something you pay serious money for, it's not as good as Debian, however they spin it, though I'll admit it's better than it use to be.</p>

If you are paying for support, then you can up2date to update from RHN.  It isn't as good as apt or yum but it works.

<p>
There is also apt for RPM.  I have done 'apt-get dist-upgrade' between different Redhat releases.  For RHEL, you will have to download the updates and build your own repository.</p>

<p>up2date is okay, but not as good as apt. It does work after a fashion, and having been on the course I do know more about it than last time I tried to do all this. To be honest it has so far all worked, but unlike Debian where I just do the apt dance without thinking, I had to refer to notes, and fiddle with the order and fix some dependancies to get the RPMs to install.</p>

<p>I don't think RedHat is a bad OS, compared with Windows XP it's leagues ahead, but I just think Debian is better.</p>

<p>I've heard about this, but I've never actually seen it. In theory we'll be using the RedHat Network to do this the "corporate way", but even then it's a pain. If only Debian was IBM/SAP certified then we'd run that...</p>

<p>I'll have a look into yum though, if it make my life a little easier, then it's worth looking at.</p>

<h2>new FC3 yum</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/WebDragon/">WebDragon</a> on 2004-12-07T21:32:13</h3>
The version of Yum that comes with Fedora Core three is miles above its predecessors -- far far faster, and much better handling of mirrors (i.e. automatically), and alternate repos.<br> <br>Definitely have a look if you've only seen previous releases.

<p>Seesm that there are lots of bright shiny things in FC3. Alas we are running the more pin-striped Enterprise Linux 3. Obviously I'll have to investigate Yum, but the company will prefer to buy and use RedHat's up2date suite.</p>
