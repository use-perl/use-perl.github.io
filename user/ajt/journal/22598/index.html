<div class="span8">
<p><p>Last year I tried to use <a href="http://maypole.perl.org/">Maypole</a> to create a simple web Create, Review, Update and Delete (CRUD) DB application. It looked like Maypole would be perfect, but it was a dismal failure, lots of things didn't work, the docs were way out of date, and I gave up. This week I gave it another go, the module had been upgraded slightly and there had been quite a few documentation fixes. It worked first time, and I've now started to tinker with it to find out how it works.</p>

<p>It's all very clever stuff, and I can mow build my own Maypole application for our graphic designer. Some how I have to integrate it into a Document Managmement System - but that's another story...</p></p>

Thank you, that's exactly what I needed to hear to encourage me to try the same experiment. I'm glad I deferred trying it.<br> <br>-Bill

<p>I think the problem is that they radically changed it when going to version 2. This means just about anything written about Maypole, including much of it's own documentation was wrong. Since the upgrade, they have fixed a lot of the little problems, and improved a lot of the module's documentation, so it's now  easier to use. The POD is a lot better now, and there is the <a href="http://maypole.perl.org/" title="perl.org">Maypole</a perl.org> site which is a good resource.</p>

<p>I would now recommend trying it out now, it's a great tool, and it has a great future.</p>

Oh, so it's finally going to be used?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>I wish... I fear that they want to expend developer time developing a new interim light-weight system, until a full SAP based system is fully developed. Why spend a squillion, when for ten squillion you have an inferior system that's years late...</p>

<p>To ensure project failure, appoint a committee of managers with no experience in the topic. Me cynical...?</p>
