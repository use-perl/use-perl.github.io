<p><p>I have considered writing a journal entry for some time, but have not felt that I had anything to write that was worth reading. Now I no longer care, I have to say this, even if no one reads it.</p>

<p><strong>I HATE SPAM!</strong> Yesterday evening I got a polite email from my email forwarder, informing me that I had gone over my limit of emails, and that all additional email for that day would be held and forwarded later on. In my in-box was SPAM, there wasn't a single piece of actual email in there.</p>

<p>Now, I know that there are lots of perfectly good tools for dealing with SPAM, but it annoys me that I even have to do something about it.</p>

<p>What amazes me even more, is that somewhere in the world there are people gullible enough to fall for "penis/breast enlargement for only $9.99", or "re-mortgage for free", or whatever insane idea the spammers are selling....</p>

<p>Technically I think under new EU guidelines they are breaking the law, but I don't think this is going to help me now</p>
