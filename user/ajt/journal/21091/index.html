<p><p>We run RedHat Linux and Enterprise Linux on a number of systems at work. When the current Perl/SAP project ends I'm hoping to persuade work to send me on one a RedHat training course so I'm better able to run these systems.</p>

<h2>RHCE</h2>

A while back I picked up the RHCE book (RH302) from McGraw Hill/Osborne, and while it was quite good, it still left me wanting more _details_ in-depth.<br> <br>Naturally the RHL 8.0 release I originally purchased the book for was quickly superseded, and I'm curious to know how the whole Fedora Core thing will shake out as far as RHCE is concerned.<br> <br>I've tried my best to keep up but the introduction of the 2.6 kernel has left me in the dust -- too much change! (all for the good, mind you, but there's still a lot to learn for the average novice much less an experienced tech like myself)

<p>From what I can find out, the course is targetted at RedHat Enterprise Linux, not Fedora Core, or the older RedHat Linuxen. I don't know much else, I have to dig into the matter further.</p>

<p>I took their self-assesment test for the RHCT course, and I did okay on most of the stuff, but not so good on vi/vim, floppies or cron. I'm hoping to do the RHCT course, then the security course, and finally the RHCE course, which is over 12 days of training and two exams. I doubt the firms budget will stretch to doing it all this year, but I'd like to get some of it done.</p>

Interestingly, the book comes with a disk containing a few sample tests, multiple choice quizzes, etc, but the programs will only run under Windows. =8P They're very apologetic about it, but surely someone could have faked up something to run in ncurses or Tcl/Tk if not Gtk<br> <br>ugh.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>Rather ironic! I agree, it can't be that hard to to manage a curses, or even command line front end. A nice GUI would be nice, but I suppose you can't tell what system someone has, and there are differences, but you would expect to be able to actually run the software on a RedHat system...</p>

<p>Anyhow, I've prodded my manager, and in the mean time, I'm going to study my "Running Linux" book by Walsh <em>et al.</em>. I think I'm capable of doing the RedHat Certified Technician course, but I won't know until I try it. If it's too easy, it's not my money that I've lost, and if it's too hard I'll just fail! Once I've got that done, I'll be better able to approach the Engineer level course.</p>

<p>Another useful reference guide I've found (albiet slightly dated nowadays what with the 2.6 kernel being current) is <a href="http://www.icon.co.za/user/psheer/rute-home.html" title="icon.co.za">rute</a icon.co.za>  which initially got me going on a lot of command line stuff I was unfamiliar with, and has occasionally filled in some info that I was unaware of since then. </p>
