<p><p>This morning I apparently became a Saint over on <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/">PerlMonks</a>. As  <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/broquaint/">broquaint</a> recently said "Maybe the guards are off duty". I'm currently the most junior Saint in the system, though I'm sure another Pontiff will break through in a matter of days.</p>

<p>One thing that amazes me is that my most highly regarded nodes are questions, good questions I thought, but still only questions. What is even more puzzling is that though the nodes were well rated, I never got much in the way of useful answers for most of them. Other nodes, with lower reputations, did get useful answers, or I thought were better nodes anyway. <strong>Strange....</strong></p>

<p>Anyhow, it's nice and sunny today, and after a good and early start I've made progress on my web site, updating the Perl books section. I've not actually reduced my To Do list by one item, rather by one sub-item - which is still better than nothing.</p>

<p>I've also decided to buy some more books, <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perllwp/">Perl &amp; LWP</a> looks interesting, and I'm considering another XML/XSLT book too. I suppose for reducing my list by one sub-item, I'm allowed to add another sub-item or two elsewhere...</p></p>

It seems sainthood at the monastery is too heavily related to the number of questions you asked. The whole system needs a bit of a review - it would be better if the original poster has a sort of ace card on a particular thread, so that the most relevant answers get more XP assigned to them.<br> <br>*shrug* though. It's not all about XP I guess.
