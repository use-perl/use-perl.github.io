<div class="span8">
<p><p>This week I tried to book a ferry trip to France on the <a href="http://www.brittanyferries.com/">Brittany Ferries</a> web site. The stupid form allows a party of two to book a crossing including a cabin, but only allows one bicycle. I booked my crossing, but was suspicious about the phrase "one vehicle per booking", which is absurd for a party travelling on bikes, as normally you have one bike each.</p>

<p>I sent an email to them to query the booking, to be told that I must make two separate bookings on-line, one per person, or ring them up to place the booking manually. No where on the site is this mentioned! It's not possible to make one booking per person, if you plan to share a cabin, as their system can't allow for a person not having a seat or cabin. What planet do their site designers people live on, that think a couple or family travelling by bike, have only one bike between them?</p></p>

<p>Maybe they're all called (or married to) Daisy and think that people have tandems. Or maybe they are just die hard <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ilove/years/1970/goodies.shtml" title="bbc.co.uk">goodies</a bbc.co.uk> fans.(*)</p>
<p> <small>* This would make more sense if I (or google) could find an image of the goodies' bike. Or maybe I'm just misremembering it. I reckon it's just a conspiracy by the BBC to try to make people forget it, so that they never need to repeat it, fearing that people will release how much funnier it is than the current output.</small> </p>

<p>I did think of tandems, but they are not exactly common....</p>

<p>However I hadn't thought of the Goodies, can you imagine them on a ferry to France?</p>

<p>No. It's far too mundane. I think they'd put floats under the wheels and cycle across. Or use a long hose, lead weights, and cycle across the seabed. Or something actually funny - I don't feel I'm doing very well on the "thinking of inane ways to cross the channel" stakes.</p>
