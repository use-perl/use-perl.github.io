At the moment we are wrestling with testing our shiny new Perl based SAP Web Application at work. The actual Perl module it's built on took 2 weeks to write and test. Configuring up the application on top of the module took about 4 weeks, and at the current rate testing will take an additional 8 weeks.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that the Perl Application Server is so stable and reliable when compared with the original Business Connector Server, that we can now find and fix all the little back end problems. Previously the system died with no useful information, and we had no idea what broke it. Now we get useful error messages, and the project leader sends us in, to fix old bugs in the underlying code on SAP. This has removed far more bugs than we thought possible, and delayed the roll-out somewhat.
</p>

<p>
It's a bit frustrating from my perspective, we deliberately moved as much business logic out of the front-end and middle-ware into the back-end, so when something goes wrong it's almost always in the back-end. My problems are usually simply typos in the <a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/">TT2</a> layer, and fixed in minutes. Most of the day I surrounded with frantic bug fixing, but I've not got a lot to do myself.
</p>

<p>
It has been suggested that I write/present our experiences, and work isn't openly opposed to this. The snag is that it's so damn simple, that there isn't a lot to say...
