<p><p>Today has not been very productive. I've had a few mindless queries about the web site from IE users, problems with Maypole and a new project to deal with.</p>

<p>I'm supposed to be working on a secure frakework to move B2B orders from a machine in the DMZ to one behind the firewall, but I just can't motivated. It should be interesting, it's a mix of Perl/Bash and SSH, so it's all doable and useful I just can't get into it it.</p>

<p>I've also offered to get Maypole running for a colleague, but so far it don't work. It installs okay, reads okay, but no one can commit any changes to the SQLite database - and yes I've checked the permissions.</p>

<p>The distracting IE users are a pain. I know they can't help using IE, it's company policy, but I wish they wouldn't ask me to help them fix their problems, I don't use IE.</p>

<p>It's now getting too warm and stuff in the office, and I think I'll have to turn on my desk fan to avoid falling asleep - and getting sacked...</p>

<p>If I'm really lucky I'll get home and "ERNIE" (Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment) will have sent me a cheque for ÃÂ£1 000 000, I'm due for some luck...</p></p>
