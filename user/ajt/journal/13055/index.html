<p><p>I don't really like Air Conditioning (AC). When I lived in New England, it didn't help with the crushing humidity, and when I lived in southern California it was usually so strong and icy that I got cramp in my joints from the cold.</p>

<p>The best thing about AC at work is that it breaks all the time, so we are allowed to open the windows, and then it's great. Normally it's either stiflingly hot, or freezing cold, even if it's actually a nice dull 20C outside.</p>

<p>On a hot day the best place to be is in the server room, where it's always nice and cool, and usually you get left in peace. Actually the best place to be is on holiday, but failing that the server room will do....</p>

<h2>ACs &amp;amp; Humidity</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Elian/">Elian</a> on 2003-06-25T15:37:17</h3>
I know what you mean about ACs in New England. They're nice when the temperature hits the 90s (like today) but otherwise they're nasty overkill--you're far better off with a plain dehumidifier than an AC. While an air conditioner does dehumidify as part of its function they usually make things too cold, since most of the darned things don't let you set the temp high enough. If it's 85 out, I'd be happy to set the AC at 80 just to dry things out and cool them off a bit, but I've not come across a temp-controlled air conditioner that goes above 74.<br> <br>It's the dehumidifier that really makes a machine room comfy--the AC takes it down to 72 or 74, then the dehumidifier rips the relative humidity to a comfortable 30% or so. To get 30% humidity from just an air conditioner seems to require arctic temps...
