<div class="span8">
<p><p>This week I have had a number of minor font triumphs. Last weekend I copied a bunch of Windows TrueType fonts of my now unused Windows partition, and a convinced XFS to serve them up. It was pretty easy to do, and now I have more nice scalable fonts than you could shake a stick at. All I really want are a nice set of fonts to use in X, and some easy to read fixed-pitch fonts for use in a console window - nothing fancy.</p>

<p>It's a bit silly really, as the "<a href="http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/">MS Core Fonts</a>" and nice Bitstream <a href="http://www.gnome.org/fonts/">Vera</a> family, pretty much cover most of my needs, but it's always nice to have the extra fonts, in case I ever need them. As the defaults fonts that came with Debian/KDE are awful, adding extra really improved the readability and usefulness of my install.</p>

<p>Just to keep things all syncronised, I also installed the Vera font family on my Windows machine and at work. My next challenge was to get Cygwin to use TrueType fonts. In the past I've never got this to work, but this time I realised that it was simply a missing font path in the default Cygwin install, and suddenly all the TrueType fonts worked!</p>

<p>All that I have to do now is decide which fonts is best for console work, which is where I do most of my work. As a dyslexic I find the syntax-coloured variable-width-font interface of many modern IDEs hard to use, so I tend to use a simple (monochrome) text editor with a fixed width font.</p>

<ul>
<li>Monotype's "Andale Mono" is a really nice font that Microsoft "gave away" as part of the core fonts, and is a particular favourite.</li>
<li>Monotype's "Arial monospaced for SAP" isn't too bad, but it's a bit boxy, and it's not very common.</li>
<li>Bitstream's "Vera Sans Mono" is another nice font, but it doesn't look as nice on the screen as it does printed. At the moment this is my current favourite.</li>
<li>B&H's "Lucida Console" is an old favourite, but it has open zeros that I easily mistake for capital Os. Otherwise it's a nice font.</li>
</ul>
