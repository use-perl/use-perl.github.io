<p><p>This week I've been working on my <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-RSS-Tools/">XML::RSS::Tools</a> module at home and on some SAP ABAP development at work. At work within SAP I don't have the luxury of a nice testing environment and code coverage tools that I use to at home for Perl.</p>

<p>I know Perl better than ABAP, so I think it's fair to say that my Perl code is better than my ABAP. What amazes me is how poor code can be unless you really analyse it properly, even when you think it's good. I've been using Test::Cover and the PBP guidelines to improved XML::RSS::Tools, it's my oldest module, and the test coverage is quite puny - though getting better.</p>

<p>Ironically I spotted this today on El Reg: <a href="http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/codetools/">Teaching an Old Dog New Tricks</a>, quite appropriate timing I thought.</p></p>

It was an interesting article, though it degenerated into an advertisement for the security checker by the end.<br><br>At least that's what I thought, but wasn't sure. So kept on reading.<br><br>I think I liked the insights about what you learn from learning how to program. What's the take-home learning.

<p>I agree it's a bit of an advert, but it's also interesting to see someone admit that code they thought they had written well, wasn't!</p>
