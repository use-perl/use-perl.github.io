<p><p>Just before I went on holiday I'd got a pretty good <a href="http://maypole.perl.org/">Maypole</a> system running. All I had to do was add user authentication/authorisation, and the business would be happy. In the last minutes before leaving I upgraded to version 2.10 and started to add the user changes.</p>

<p>Time passes...</p>

<p>I get back from holiday, and start hacking again. Now nothing works at all, I've unravelled all my work. The wise would now nod knowingly and go back to their respository and pull out a working version from before the holiday. As this was a hack all along I didn't bother to put anything in CVS, I could get copies of backup tapes, but I think it's easier to just start from scratch...</p>

<p>I'm pretty good at breaking things, and if I break something often enough I usually learn to leave it alone in future, or have a really good idea how it works.</p></p>

You have subscribed to the list and asked on there about it haven't you?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>Failing that there is a changelog in the 2.10 Distribution that describes the changes made - usually with a rt.cpan id, from which you should also have an SVN revision number to check the changes by hand.<br><br>Either way - let me know if there is a problem as we're working hard to ensure exactly this kind of thing doesn't happen - we even have a site to smoketest every svn update.<br><br>

<p>Yes I've subscribed to the list, but I'm asuming I've done something stupid at the moment, rather that it being broken. Other than the same test failing as all previous versions, it passes all the other tests okay.</p>

<p>I just need to apply the time to look at it carefully, and of late my time has been split with various SAP things. If I can't make any progress I will post to the list.</p>
