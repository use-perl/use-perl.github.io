<p><p>This week I uploaded version 0.13 of XML-RSS-Tools to CPAN. Some nice soul ran a test of it for me on their SPARC box, and it failed some tests. The problem is, I don't know what's actually wrong, the test report I got doesn't have enough useful information in it. I know it passes all tests on Linux/5.6.1, Linux/5.8.0 and Windows/5.8.0, with and without XML cataog support. The only problem may be with XML::LibXML &amp; XML::LibXSLT, which periodically change their behaviour - and have tripped me up before.</p>

<p>What I should look into is making the test failures more diagnostic, so I have a better idea of what went wrong, and hence how to fix it.</p></p>

I just started messing around with it on my Sunblade.  I'm already hitting make test failures with XML::LibXML, so maybe there's an issue there.  I'll try to keep you posted.

<p>Ta, as good as <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-LibXML" title="cpan.org">XML::LibXML</a cpan.org> &amp; <a href="http://www.xmlsoft.org/" title="xmlsoft.org">libxml2</a xmlsoft.org> are as a combination, they are a bit of a moving target - which where I fear my problem lies. Do let me know if you are able to dig deep enough to find out why it's not working, I will then do my best to fix it!</p>

<h2>Ask the tester</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2004-03-31T15:09:41</h3>
In a case like this, I write back to the tester and politely ask for a rerun of the specific test, either through prove, or with HARNESS_VERBOSE=1.

<p>The same tester found a problem with 0.13_6, but never replied to my email. Thankfully in that case I was able to figure out what the problem was without their input. Ironically their system tested and passed version 0.13_7, which as far as I can tell is identical to 0.13 with respect to the test suite and the code in question...</p>

<p>I think that libxml can return different XML depending upon which version you have, small white space changes are (mostly) valid in XML, but make checking that it's correct a real pain from the point of view of testing!</p>
