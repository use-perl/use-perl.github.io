<p><p>I use to work in the Content Management industry for what was EBT, then Inso, then eBusiness Technologies, then eBT, now <a href="http://www.rbii.com/">RBI</a>. I always lamented the fact that there wasn't a Perl or at least Perl friendly CMS, all the big boys were obsessed with Java, and the little guys loved ASP or PHP. Okay there were some, Interwoven had Perl in it, but it wasn't exactly something you could run on a home Linux box.</p>

<p>Anyhow, since leaving eBT I've followed the CMS market from a buyer's position, and been particularly interested by <a href="http://www.bricolage.cc/">Bricolage</a>, now it seems it's getting lots of <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/53/30838.html">good reports</a>.</p>

<p>At work we seriously need to a proper CVS and CMS approach to replace our antiquated paper based systems. Perhaps now is the time to seriously investigate.....</p></p>

David will be giving a talk about Bricolage at YAPC::America this year. I don't know which side of the pond you're on, but a Florida vacation in the middle of June is nice.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>Wrong side of the pond, alas! I'm hoping to go to YAPC::EU though.</p>

<p>It's been a while since I've been to Florida, last time I went we pitched our tent a few metres from the beach at <a href="http://www.dep.state.fl.us/parks/district1/stjoseph/" title="state.fl.us"> St. Joseph Peninsula State Park</a state.fl.us>. It was amazing, once you walked through the bug infested trees onto the beach, and up a kilometre or two from the beach access point it was amazing. Pure white sand, warm clean water, and we saw pretty much no one all day. It was one of the most idilic places I've ever been in my life, though most beautiful would have to be Bryce Canyon....</p>
