<p><p>Recently I ordered a few books and DVDs from this famous online retailer. I've been dealing with Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk for nearly 7 years now, and in the past I have found their service to be good, and their prices mostly reasonable.</p>

<p>This most recent order has not been up to their usual standard, and I'm very annoyed with them. I ordered a number of items all on 24hour availability. I expected an email within a few days letting me know that they had been dispatched and would be with me soon. A week after ordering I checked their site, and the estimated delivery date was now in the past and nothing seemed to have happened, they were still waiting to dispatch.</p>

<p>I sent in an email asking "Where's my stuff?" and got a minion assuring me that they would look into it. Nothing happened. A week later, a dispatch email arrived saying one item had shipped, and the following day one item from the order did arrive.</p>

<p>I waited, and then complained again. By now more than 14 days had passed, the rest of the order was still marked as dispatching soon, and the estimated date was now over a week in the past. Nothing, not a sausage, they didn't even bother to reply.</p>

<p>I waited, still nothing, again I complained. This time I told them if it's not here within 48 hours then I don't want the stuff, and if it does arrive after the expected date they can pay to collect it, and I expect a full refund. I've also told them that I'll never do business with them again.</p>

<p>I don't mind that things are not on time, they have weasel words in the terms and conditions anyway, what I do hate is them no bothering to let me know that they are having problems, or any attempt to apologise!</p>
