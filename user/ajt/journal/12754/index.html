<div class="span8">
<p><p>This week the UK's incumbent Telco monopoly claimed to have <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/22/31091.html">1 million ADSL customers</a>*. When BT made their announcement, they did reduce the targets for the 3000 or so exchanges in the UK that aren't yet ADSL enabled, by 50 registrants for exchanges with targets. This now means that the village has triggered ADSL, and if enough of us actually place real orders BT will at long last enable ADSL on our exchange! All going well I may get connected to the rest of reality before the end of the year!</p>

<p>All I have to do now is decide which ADSL router I want, and sort my kit out properly. I'll probably try and upgrade my Sun and use it as a web server, and buy a new AMD box for my main system, moving to a pure Linux/BSD desktop away from the dual boot system I currently use.</p>

<p>*Combined with cable, that's a few million at most, compared with the 20 million in the US, a country of only 5-6 times the population. Our PM, is the only major <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/31142.html">world leader</a> without an e-mail address, apparently he is in good company though, Castro and Mugabe don't have email either!</p>

<p>That <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/31142.html" title="theregister.co.uk">Register story</a theregister.co.uk> goes on to report that the Tories have helpfully set him up a hotmail account. Maybe they should put their own house in order first - it seems that Ian Duncan-Smith <a href="http://www.faxyourmp.com/stats.php3" title="faxyourmp.com">doesn't answer any of his faxes</a faxyourmp.com>, unlike Tony Blair, who does answer some.</p>

<p>I'm not surprised!</p>

<p>It's not as if most politicians actually want to hear what people say anyway, in my experience they are mostly a bunch of cynical power crazed incompetents that would do something useful if they were actually good at anything. Having said that, I know some who pay attention and say what I think needs saying, however they don't seem to get elected much....</p>
