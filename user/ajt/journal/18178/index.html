<p><p>A few weeks ago the boss mentioned that he wanted to look at replacing some
of the unpopular Americanism in the company with something more local. One of his ideas was a Diary of Success Stories on the Intranet. Seeing as the Intranet's my baby and I'll have to do the work anyway, I suggested something, before a silly idea was suggested to me. I thought at once of a web-logging tool, in this case the ever so simple <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/">Blosxom</a>.</p>

<p>So I sent an email to the boss, briefly describing a blog, and stating that
it was both easy and cheap to do. After a short delay, he's a very busy bloke,
he replied that he liked it, so after a chat with the HR department, we are planning to go ahead with a company wide blog.</p>

<p>Today I had a few hours free, so I was playing with blosxom on our DEV Intranet server, getting the look and feel right, and installing it on the QA and LIVE boxen. In the initial phase staff will send an email to a drop box for approval and English checking (we have a lot of non-native English speaking staff throughout Europe, and I'm dyslexic too), then I'll create the entry directly on the server. Later on, I will create a simple form so HR can add entries directly.</p></p>

You might like to take a look at <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bryar/" title="cpan.org">Bryar</a cpan.org> instead. It works in much the same way as Blosxom, but it's easier to extend. In particular it's simple to store your data in different formats (like, for example, a database) and also the front end is all in TT.

<p>I had thought about Bryar, after the I saw the <a href="http://www.perl.com/lpt/a/2003/12/18/bryar.html" title="perl.com">perl.com article</a perl.com>. Being able to store data in a DB of some kind sounds like a step up, though I doubt we will get that volume of success stories.</p>

<p>I don't like TT, I know lots of people like it, and I gather it's good at it's job, but I think it's a fundamentally flawed design, just like JSP or ASP. I like the idea of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/" title="w3.org">XSLT</a w3.org>, though I do accept, that it too, is seriously flawed....</p>

<p>However I will look at Bryar again, we are not wedded to any particular solution, though Perl ones are favoured....<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>

<p>Thank God.  I thought I was the only one...</p>
