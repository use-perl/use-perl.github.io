<div class="span8">
<p><p>The <a href="http://www.bt.com/">Monster</a> Telco has finally set an installation date for ADSL in our village. From 15 October 2003, I should be able to connect using ADSL rather than the rather feeble WinModem I currently use.</p>

<p>I'll naturally run a NAT router, and migrate away from my current Windows system towards a more Unix one (Mac OS X or Linux...). This will also mean I'll be able to stop using a rather feeble Windows HTTP proxy, and get rid of some of the technical clutter that I appear to have accumulated.</p>

<p>Interestingly at work I've recently undergone a retrograde firewall/proxy experience. Since replacing my NT4 desktop system with a NT5/2K system I can no longer reach a production NT4 web server with SMB via the NAT firewall. Unless there is a way to downgrade the behaviour it looks like Microsoft changed how SMB/CIFS works between NT4 and 5, such that it fails when running through a NAT router, in a similar way to FTP failing through SSH. After a certain amount of fiddling (I respect our NT admins, but they do start with a serious handicap of using NT), I managed to get them to add BASIC authentication to the proxy as well as NTLM, so now a lot of machines that had no hope of connecting to the Internet now do.</p>

<p>One up shot of this is that LWP doesn't work if the proxy is running NTLM and BASIC authentication, I have to dig into that further, and I will now add proxy support to XML::RSS::Tools - it's in most of the HTTP clients anyway, it's just a case of configuring it.</p></p>
