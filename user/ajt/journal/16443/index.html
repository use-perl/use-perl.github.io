<p><p>I bothered to read the instructions for <a href="http://viceteam.bei.t-online.de/">VICE</a> on Debian, this weekend, and installed and got the C64 emulator working okay, on my desktop system. I've used the Windows port before, but found it a bit unstable, and not worth playing with. The Linux version seems very stable, and even sounds good!</p>

<p>I could just take my old C64 out of the loft and connect it to my nice TV in the living room, but it would take up lots of space, and it would clutter the room up too much.</p>

<p>If I ever win lots of money, and can afford a nice big house, then I'll have my old C64 set up some where properly so I can play the odd game now and then.</p>

The nice thing about emulators is that they load the games a heck of a lot faster.  Instant gratification in a way that you could only have dreamed of 20 years ago!

You mean you didn't like waiting 10 minutes for a game to load from a tape<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>Back then my idea of instant gratification was when I got my first disk drive for my C64.  Compared to waiting for the bloody tape machine, that *was* instant loading as far as I was concerned<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>The disk drive was much faster, but even then you'd hardly call it a speedy!</p>

<p>I never thought of that. The Old C2N was an evil contraption, and the 1541 disk drive was equally nasty. I had one of those turbo/free cartridges and the Oceaninc OC-118 disk drives, so load time wasn't too bad.</p>

Blimey, I too had an Oceanic drive.  I had a cartridge called "The Freeze Machine" or something like like.  Handy for making, er, backups as I recall<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>Sounds like my kit, was the cartridge red? It worked quite well at backing up tape games to disk for faster access. I got mine from Evesham Micros, I think they sell AMD64 now....</p>

<p>Did you also have GEOS? I wrote my undergraduate report with GEO Write as it was a better word processor than MS Word for Windows....</p>

GEOS! That was some tight code. It ran a nice GUI on a 386/16 SX.

<p>I gather the x86 version was quite good, but I think the older 8-bit version on a 64k computer was a masterpiece. It was better than Windows 3.0 on a 16-bit processor, running 20 times faster, with more than 10 times the amount of memory, and a hard disk rather than 5.25 floppies!</p>
