<p><p>At the end of a miserable wet Bank Holiday, I put Config::Trivial 0.70 up onto CPAN. However it's not really a lot different from the earlier 0.60 version. I made some minor tweaks to the build process but that's about all.</p>

<p>The problem is that I planned to do stuff to it but I was distracted over the weekend by my partner who was recovering from a cold and was not happy with the cold and wet weather. She is better now so I'm hoping to sneak out a 0.71 version with the actual things in it I had originally planned...</p>

<p><small>PS. Does anyone still use Perl 5.6.x, I've not seen test results for pre 5.8 platforms for ages.</small></p>

<p>There are at least one CPAN tester (david) running perl 5.6.2.</p>

The people doing CPAN Testers are not representative of all Perl users as a set.<br><br>There's a whole bunch of people using older servers with older Perls out there.<br><br>

<p>That's what I thought. Our production boxen at work still use 5.6.1... Being production makes them harder to use a testing platforms...</p>

<p>I suppose I'll have to build and install a local 5.6.2 on my Debian Lenny box at home.</p>

<h2>5.6.2</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/drhyde/">drhyde</a> on 2007-05-31T10:56:51</h3>
I test everything on 5.6.2.  I try to do so within a couple of days of the module being uploaded to the PAUSE, and email the author with FAIL and UNKNOWN results.  PASS results only go to the cpan-testers list.

<p>Reasons I might not test your module are if it has a pre-requisite that fails its tests, or another module I was testing crashed my testing script.  I have a machine with a guest account and perl 5.6.2 on it if you want to test for yourself.  Email me for the details.</p>

<p>Thanks for the offer but I should download and install a<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>/usr/local/bin </code> copy of 5.6.2, then I can test things properly myself. I was just surprised that when I looked at my test results, I've not seen much 5.6.x activity in a while.</p>

<h2>Yup</h2>

The project I just joined is using 5.6.0 actually. In the re-write I hope to get them up to the 5.8 series.
