<p><p>Apparently Netscape (remember them?), have release Netscape 7.1, based on the latest Mozilla 1.4 build. If you hunt around the Mozilla.org site you can find Mozilla 1.4 there too - though at the time of writing still not announced. The new Mozilla just entering alpha is based on the Phoenix/Firebird version of the browser, the same Gecko rending engine, but an OS native GUI interface, a lot less baggage, and in theory a faster browser that looks like it's part of the OS. I must admit I rather like the current versions of Mozilla, and I've yet to be convinced by the current Phoenix versions.</p>

<p>To celebrate this news, well actually because if I don't pick the fruit the birds will, I made a Blackcurrant and Banana frozen yoghurt. I've not tried it yet, as it's freezing away in the freezer, but it tasted okay before I put it away:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 ripe bananas - I use fair trade so I have less guilt</li>
<li>300-350 ml full-fat natural yogurt - mine is the rather nice Yeo Valley stuff*</li>
<li>75g dark fruit, e.g blackberries, winberry (blueberry), and in my case blackcurrants.</li>
<li>sugar to taste, if you add sugar it sill set softer, but without it, it could be very sharp if your fruit isn't sweet</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically you chop the soft ripe bananas, and mix them with the fruit in a blender, and zap until nice and smooth. Mix in your yoghurt, and pour into the ice-cream mixer thing, and churn. If you don't have one then pop in the freezer, and take out to mix every now and then, until you are happy.</p>

<p>I'm just going to taste mine..... <strong>Wow!</strong> mine is rather sharp, if you have sharp fruit then I'd add some sugar unless you like things really biting!</p>


<p><small>* I'd like to link their site, but all I got were 404 File Not found errors....?</small></p></p>

<p>You're implying that even fair trade bananas have residual guilt. (original guilt?) Why would that be?</p>

<p>I have no problem paying the small grower a fair price, but Fair-Trade goods sold in a giant supermarkets, must still have layers of money being skimmed off by large corporations. The produce may also still be growing in an non-sustainable manner, which isn't good for the grower or his environment.</p>

<p>I also have guilt about the pollution caused by moving thousands of tonnes of produce half way round the world to satisfy consumers in the west, when in truth we can do without most tropical products or temperate products out of season.</p>

<p>I certainly wouldn't eat most "factory" produced animal products, and I try to avoid mass-produced foods as general rule. On the whole I do favour Fair-Trade or organic produce, that's not only because of the moral position, but because smaller scale production tends to be of a higher quality.</p>

<p>At the end of the day nothing is impact free, so while "A" maybe better than "B", it's still not perfect. Even my home grown fruit has an impact, and I shouldn't really begrudge the birds eating some of it....</p>
