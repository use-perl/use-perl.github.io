<p><p>About a year ago I installed Debian on my PC at home. I had some space, so I was able to do this without upsetting the already resident Windows NT system. Shortly after that we got ADSL, and I started to really dig into Debian/Linux and actually learn how to run a system rather than just dabble.</p>

<p>Time passes.</p>

<p>I've now been running Debian for nearly a year, and in that time, I've only re-booted into NT to get things of the disk that needed to be interfaced via a Windows program, or to deactivate some of the partitions to free up space. This morning I removed the last Windows partitions, and installed lilo as be default boot loader on the default disk. I am now Windows free!</p>

<p>I know people question why I run Debian stable as a desktop system, but it just works, and it doesn't break. I know it's not the latest or greatest system, but the hardware it's running on is antique anyway, so it couldn't run the latest KDE/GNOME desktop anyway, it just doesn't have the grunt.</p>

<p>I've now decided that my next machine will be a <a href="http://www.dnuk.com/">DNUK</a> dual Opteron Workstation running Debian Sarge or Etch in x86-32bit mode. When AMD64 support moves into Debian stable I'll upgrade then, when it's good and ready. In the mean time, I'm sure that a dual Opteron system is pretty capable of runing Debian in 32-bit mode, and it will be faster than my current system however I look at it.</p>
