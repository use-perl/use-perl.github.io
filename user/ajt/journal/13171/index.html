<p><p>After I installed Mozilla 1.4 last night, I must say I'm impressed. On the various machines I have, I tend to leaf-frog versions, so while I've been running 1.3.1 on my work machine for some time, my home machine had not, so it went from 1.1.1 to 1.4.</p>

<p>It looks and feels very similar to the 1.3.1 version I have at work, but it has a few extra minor tweaks. It does feels a lot better than the rather elderly version it replaced, much faster, a lot more responsive, and cosmetically much improved.</p>

<p>I've also been playing with Opera 7.11 at work too, another great little browser. Cosmetically I prefer Mozilla, but they are both great, and clearly better than the bloated and buggy offering from Microsoft.</p>

<p>What I'd like to know is, what are AOL up to? They have just launched AOL8 in the UK based on Mozilla, and at the same time accepted IE for many years to come. While they may now use IE, are they actually going to? after they have just got Mozilla to a position that it's very usable, or are they going to continue to offer AOL based on Mozilla? Given the growth of Linux on the desktop and at home, it seems like it's in their interest to keep it alive, so they can run AOL on Linux, after all they are in the business of making money...</p> </p>
