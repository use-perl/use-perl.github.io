<p><p>Opera 8 came out recently. It's not as trendy as Firfox, and it's not open source, but it's a good browser, and deserves a look at. The new version has a whole bunch of extra features, and some of them are really cool and useful.</p>

<h2>Trendy?</h2>

I am not sure what you mean by 'trendy.'  Perhaps more well known?<br/><br/>Regardless, I have Opera 8 and it blows doors off of Firefox!<br/><br/>I-N-T-E-G-R-A-T-I-O-N, baby!<br/><br/>I could write a mini-book on how Opera's integration of everything under-the-sun-on-the-Internet is unique and smart and not duplicated anywhere else.<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>My contact properties allow me to enter chat nicknames. When in chat, that person's unique contact image appears in the chat panel when he is online<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... neat!<br/><br/>While chatting, I can easily send an email to one of my contacts in the chatroom<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... neat!<br/><br/>While browsing, I can easily select a group of text and right-click and send via email to any of my contacts<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... neat!<br/><br/>While browsing (if I need to give my neck and shoulders and rear-end a break) but am interested in reading one final article, I can simply select the text and have the voice read the article to me after I turn up the volume and take a walk around the house---neat!<br/><br/>While chatting, I need to spell-check my new big word<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... simple with Opera, and I want to tell somebody in the chatroom about my new favorite bookmark. Simply drag the bookmark over to the chatroom posting area<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... great stuff!<br/><br/>Ah, I just got a great newsfeed article notice<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... my friend would love to read this. I know what I'll do, I'll press 'F' and forward it to him. Excellent!<br/><br/>I could go on and on<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br/><br/>Suffice to say, the merging together of chat, browser, mail, news, and contacts makes Opera uniquely gifted.<br/><br/>It's very trendy on my PC!

<p>Mozilla Firefox gets all the media attention, and is clearly more well known. There are somethings about Opera that annoy me, but it is VERY fast browser, and packs an awful lot of features into a small space - overall I do like it. Alas the Linux version isn't quite as feature rich as the Windows version, but it is a good browser, and lots of people "in the know" do use it, even if the great unwashed don't.</p>
