<p><p>Well I finally <i>" 'Padre' installed successfully "</i>. I installed it using Strawberry Perl on a Windows XP Professional machine.
</p>
<p>
At first I was facing problems installing Padre (and several other modules), but all now installs fine after I delete everything in my build folder( <i>C:\Documents and Settings\tclwarrior\Application Data\.cpanplus\5.10.0\build </i>) before installing any module that fails.
</p>
<p>Now to my trial of padre. And the first thing to say is "Padre is pretty". I absolutely loved the interface (kudos to Wx). If you were a notepad++ or scite fan, you will love it too, it looks even better than both these editors!.
I also opened a file that contains some arabic words mixed with english, and they displayed flawlessly.
And I tried some of my Perl scripts and editing them in Padre was really fun. Padre display some little help bubles at the end of each perl function (perldoc -f)
<br>
<br>
My only negative comment is that when I opened a large text file 10 MB, padre kinda chocked on it, it took several minutes to open it, during which it was freezed. And when I tried the Doc stats function on this file, padre died for so long I had to kill it!
<br>
This was really annoying but then I remembered, Padre is meant to be a Perl IDE, or an IDE like editor in general, so maybe using it to edit large files is not one of its objectives.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, Padre is a really nice Perl Editor and I think everyone who like simple text editors should use it, not try it, use it! I added it to my context menus so now I can right click a file and select <b>Edit With Padre</b>
