I've started reading others journals and decided that since I'm enjoying it I might as well start my own.  I've always been really bad at keeping these things up to date, so we'll see how it goes.
</p>
<p>
Well to start, I'm working on this application for a little hotel/resort so they can track their reservations.  I got stuck today trying to figure out "product" dependencies.  You see, they offer cakes, and you can specify the size of the cake, the type of cake (white, chocolate, carrot), the type of frosting and filling if you want it.  So I had to figure out how to make it so that if they select "Whipping Cream" frosting, it only allows you to have "White" cake.  
</p>
<p>
My original spec only allowed for a one to one (ex: cake requires frosting), but as I was coding it I realized that would not work.  There are 4 types of frosting and 8 inch round cake cannot require all of them.
</p>
<p>
So I have to redo some of it so that products are in groups and you can have a generic "cake" require "frosting" which has sub items of the frosting types.  Then you can also have single dependencies (Whipping Cream Frosting requires White cake).
</p>
<p>
So I can have my cake and eat it too...(ouch that was bad)
</p></p>

Are you getting some kind of good deal on cake for this job?  "Sir, we can't pay you, but we'll give you a free cake every year for your birthday for free."<br> <br>Mmmm. Cake!

No, I won't get a deal on cake, but I do get to stay there for free whenever I want...(it's owned by my sister and her husband)
