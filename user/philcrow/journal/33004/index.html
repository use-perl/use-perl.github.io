<p><p>I've hit a snag with my Java to Perl 6 API converter.  Apparently pugs grammars are not yet returning ASTs as the synopsis describes.
</p>
<p>
I'm still weighing what to do about that.  There are several options.  Of course, I could learn Haskell and pitch in on the grammar internals of Perl 6, but that seems unlikely.  I'd be starting from scratch on Haskell, having never coded in a functional language before, with almost no background in grammar implementation (one admittedly close reading of the dragon book notwithstanding).
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, I could approach this as an exercise in Perl 6 generation where the implementation language of the generator is immaterial.  This is not ideal, because part of why I wanted to work on this project was to learn about Perl 6 grammars.  But it would enable me to implement something.  Then I would implement the code in Perl 5, waiting for the right moment to translate it to Perl 6.
</p>
<p>
Or, if grammars building ASTs are imminent, I could wait for the features to appear, then start.
</p>
<p>
I'm leaning heavily toward implementing in Perl 5, but have not yet firmly decided.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, I've been thinking (with help from Tim Bunce) about the structure of the AST I want the grammar to build.  The design sketch is basically done.
</p>
<p>
All that is to say, that I hope to make some coding progress this week.
</p>

<h2>Coding progress</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ron Savage/">Ron Savage</a> on 2007-04-17T01:13:19</h3>
Gee, I've never heard of that!<br><br>Is it a Perl6 built-in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-))?



<h2>Parrot?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2007-04-17T01:47:10</h3>
<p>Parrot's PGE returns ASTs.  Is that reasonably close to or exceedingly far from what you need?</p>



<h2>how about 6-on-6</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/fglock/">fglock</a> on 2007-04-17T13:34:04</h3>
There are several options under development in perl6-in-perl6 land. Have you considered mp6, or kp6 (parser returns object tree)? There is also v6.pm (Perl6-in-Perl5): parser generate HoH; grammars generate perl5 modules.
