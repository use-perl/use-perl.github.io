I'm back at my desk in Kansas after spendning most of last week at the Plat_Forms contest in Nurenberg Germany.
<p>
Our team made some strategic time management mistakes which kept us from fully completing the task assigned.  But I don't think any team actually finished it.
<p>
The hardest part was attempting to serve soap through our framework in compliance with an exteranlly mandated WSDL file.  Perhaps we could have done that with more intimate knowledge of SOAP::Lite.  Perhaps Perl needs better SOAP support.  Perhaps SOAP is fading into the dark history of computing to join the likes of RPC schemes like DCE.  It's hard for me to say.
<p>
We enjoyed touring Nurenberg.  The old city is quite old, but it is vibrant with shops and shoppers who were in no way deterred by the snow.  About a foot of it fell beginning Tuesday.  Thankfully, that is started after we arrived.  It continued to fall most of the days we were there.  
<p>
Mass transit is wonderful.  They have efficient trains, trams, and busses.
<p>
Now it's back to the normal grind, which will be easier when the jet lag wears off.
<p>

When I was writing a script to access the FTC's Do Not Call SOAP service I had no luck getting the WSDL to work in Perl or Python.  I ended up using SOAP::Lite::Simple and doing the XML messages mostly by hand.<br/><br/>I hope you are right and that "SOAP is fading into the dark history of computing."
