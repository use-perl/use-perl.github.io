In preparation for an article, a PM talk, a tutorial, and quite possibly a book on software testing with Perl, I've been working on <a href="http://wgz.org/chromatic/perl/Test-MockObject.tar.gz">Test::MockObject</a>.  The documentation, as usual, comes somewhat after the initial announcement.
</p>
<p>
I'm not completely thrilled with the interface yet, and testing the Test::Builder components accurately could fall into the bootstrapping category, but the sooner it's out there, the more likely someone with a good idea or spare time could run across it and improve it.  My plan is to have something more CPAN-worthy by the weekend.  Then again, I planned to make some enhancements to Text::WikiFormat last week, and need to fix a Cygwin test buglet for Sub::Context.
</p>
<p>
Test #5 fails on the current released version of Test::More (0.43), but I've patched it and 0.44 (or 1.0) is on its way.  Schwern is generally good about that.
</p>
<p>
On work matters, the database stuff has been "Center the date range on the report and make it bold", so that's nearly finished.  I've been doing actual Perl programming for a while, and some of it's very clever.  I wasn't having a lot of fun in my last entry, but it had been a rough day.  Things are looking Sunny.
