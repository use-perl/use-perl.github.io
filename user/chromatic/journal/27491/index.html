<p><p>Sometimes it's nice to have a single exception block guarding several potentially fatal operations.  This lets you re-use error-handling code.  However, sometimes you can recover from a single exception and move on to the next operation.  Unfortunately, Perl doesn't really support this.</p>

<p>That's why I wrote some very simple code.  Here's how it looks like from the Perl side:</p>

<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

use Runops::Resume;

my $text;
eval
{
    $text = 'before';
    print $text, "\n";
    $text = 'after';
    die "Goodbye!\n";
    print $text, "\n";
};

warn "Died '$@'" if $@;
resume();</pre>

<p>As you ought to expect, the output is:</p>

<pre>before
Died 'Goodbye!
' at example.pl line 17.
after</pre>

<p>Note that declaring lexicals <em>within</em> the eval block doesn't quite work correctly.  <em>That</em> would be scary code.</p>

<p>Between Perl and C, it's fewer than 70 lines of well-spaced code.  It's reasonably trivial to make a stack of resumable exceptions, too -- probably fewer than ten more lines of C.  <a href="http://wgz.org/chromatic/perl/Runops-Resume.tar.gz">Runops::Resume</a>.</p></p>

<h2>Stacks, multiplicity</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjore/">jjore</a> on 2007-07-23T02:57:08</h3>
You're getting very close to wanting mess with the stacks and serialize/marshal them. If the die wasn't within the current frame then I imagine stuff would be all fu-bar...<br><br>except that I also see you're doing another goto() to immediately following the resume() on falling out of the eval{}. Hmm. If the eval does some kind of further exceptional flow control with die/next/goto perhaps that's a problem.<br><br>Your additional runloop has me wishing these modules were implemented as advice to another runloop. Consider having before/around/after advice in this space. Then our various runloops might be able to co-exist.
