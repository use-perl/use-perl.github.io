<p>The wedding is on the 10th.  I'm flying to Portland at 12:30 pm on the 8th.  Between now and then, I obviously must pack and arrive at the airport early enough to pay lip service to the perception that annoying regular people will prevent evil things from happening.
<p>
In addition, there are several other things that must happen:
<ul>
    <li>Laundry must be found, washed, folded, and put away.</li>
    <li>Finish an article for the O'Reilly Network, due the 10th -- so it's really due the morning of the 8th.  Buy me a laptop and solve this problem.</li>
    <li>Start the article, as I have a few paragraphs.  Luckily, I've just now finished the <a href="http://wgz.org/chromatic/slash/Wiki.tar.gz">code</a> which the article will explain.  Unluckily, it still has rough spots.</li>
    <li>Hope someone (<a href="http://tangent.org/user/krow/">Krow</a>?) will give me feedback on the nasty SQL problem that represents the biggest rough spot.</li>
    <li>Proofread the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/runblogslash/">book</a> index by Monday morning, as it is due RIGHT AWAY.  It's a problem to promote a book when it's not ready.  Luckily, it looks relatively good as is.</li>
    <li>Receive a package containing a present for a friend.  Hopefully she is not reading this, though she probably is and I've said too much already.  If it doesn't arrive by Tuesday morning, well, that's a problem.</li>
    <li>Wrap a present for another friend for a party on the 11th and find someone who can deliver it for me.  This probably must be done by the 6th.  I may have to *find* ti first.</li>
</ul>

There's not a lot of time to complain or to grumble.  Luckily, my part in the wedding is small.  I just have to show up, do what they say, and find some toast, somewhere, provided the tuxedo fits.  I don't even have to find a date!  Now, though, it's time for a Tad Williams book, Jet Grind Radio, or sleep.</p>
