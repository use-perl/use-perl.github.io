<p><p>I'm okay with <a href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2005/11/16/ruby-the-rival.html">people promoting Ruby to Java programmers</a>, in the theory that Java isn't the be-all end-all of applications.  However, I'm fairly not okay with amazingly stupid claims such as:</p>

<blockquote><em>PHP and Perl haven't consistently produced readable code for larger applications.</em></blockquote>

<p>What exactly does that even <em>mean</em>?  Are PHP and Perl somehow preventing people from writing maintainable code?  Does Ruby somehow enforce good design, good naming conventions, encapsulation, and consistent interfaces where PHP and Perl don't?</p>

<p>Okay, I've often pointed out that PHP has a lot of flaws that make it difficult to write and maintain applications beyond a few pages -- lack of namespaces, inconsistencies in the standard library, backwards incompatibilities, and weird syntax issues.  However, the most important work is that of the programmer.  Programming languages and libraries are just tools.  If you're a deranged ape with no sense of design or style, of course you're not going to write maintainable code, whether PHP, Perl, Ruby, Java, Lisp, or even XSLT.</p>

<p>It's probably never going to happen, but a debate worth having is whether one language can be an order of magnitude more maintainable than another.  Aside from the obvious non-contenders (Malbolge, BF, and Befunge, for example), are there any mainstream programming languages that <em>really</em> enforce any sort of meaningfully good style that actively prevents people from writing bad code?  Frankly, Python's enforced indentation is a heck of a lot less useful than enforced meaningful identifiers.</p>

<p>Why are there so many unmaintainable applications written in PHP and Perl?  Because PHP and Perl let undisciplined, inexperienced programmers write useful code.  So does Ruby -- but give it the popularity and longevity of PHP and Perl (at least in English-speaking circles) and I bet you'll see plenty of bad code written in Ruby too.</p>

<p>This seems like a variant of the Hackers and Painters fallacy.  (Paul Graham is rich.  Paul Graham writes Lisp.  Therefore everyone who writes Lisp will get rich.)  "All of the good, smart programmers I know are using Ruby.  They write good code.  Therefore you can't write bad code in Ruby!"</p>

<p>It feels like there's another fallacy in there somewhere.  I want to call it the Pre-Post-Java Blindspot, where Java was the beginning of Serious Programming Languages and only its successor will unseat it.  (Like any good fallacy, you have to ignore history, such as the fact that Ruby's between 10 and 12 years old.)</p>

<p>(I mean, if you really just <em>can't</em> read regular expressions, why not admit it?  You could start a twelve-step program or something.)</p></p>

<h2>It's a strange tactic to take when promoting Ruby</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/perrin/">perrin</a> on 2005-11-17T15:03:35</h3>
I keep looking at their Ruby examples and wondering what I'm missing.  How is this going to enforce readability?  It looks just as loose and full of punctuation and freaky syntax as Perl, yet they keep talking about how easy it is to read.
<p>The whole readability issue would make more sense if they were talking about Python.  Python at least makes an attempt to eliminate TMTOWTDI, which is an active attempt to make it more maintainable (although it may be misguided, depending on who you ask).
</p><p>I just have to assume that most of these people have never seen a good program written in Perl.  They probably only know it from hacky admin scripts and the like.</p>

You might care to take a look at:
<blockquote>
   <div><a href="http://www.amrita-ebook.org/doc/drink-me/" title="amrita-ebook.org">http://www.amrita-ebook.org/doc/drink-me/</a amrita-ebook.org></div>

it builds on Chromatic's view that the quality
of a program rests with the skill of the programmer and not the choice of programming language. Again, it has a pop at Ruby in this regard.
<p>

The drink-me document also shows how it is possible to combine
perl-python-ruby re-entrantly, using program folds, and so there is no point squabbling over which language is best. When push
comes to shove: a program is just a bunch of
characters in a file. And if we're mindful
of the <i>Hackers and Painters</i> syllogism, we
realise that few programmers have what it
takes to produce Shakespearian code; I
certainly don't.
</p><p>

Now when I wrote the drink-me document, back in 2002,
I was careful to include a section
"people in glass houses<nobr> <wbr></nobr>..." for I am well aware
that the literate-programming route I am proposing to improve code-readability is not without its own
weaknesses. Moreover, if you do go to the trouble of downloading an AMRITA kit you will see that
its Perl implementation is not pretty. Large
parts of it date back to 1996 and were written
in Perl 4, and over the intervening years, bits of
Perl 5 have been tacked on, and on. It clearly
needs to be rewritten from the ground up,
but I don't have the time, or energy to do so.
</p><p>
Nevertheless, if you take a look at:
</p><blockquote>
<div><a href="http://www.amrita-ebook.org/doc/technote/nested-widgets/" title="amrita-ebook.org">http://www.amrita-ebook.org/doc/technote/nested-widgets/</a amrita-ebook.org></div>
</blockquote>
you will see that the system is capable of
producing some nifty interactive listings,
where a code-author can lead a code-reader
through the construction of a program.
Again, the approach is not without its weakeness.
But as a technology demonstrator, it shows
that there are avenues to explore, for improving
code-readability, that transcend today's Orwellian mentality: "perl bad, python good, ruby best."

<h2>Ada was specifically designed for sound coding.</h2>

The <a href="http://www.adahome.com/" title="adahome.com">Ada programming language</a adahome.com> was specifically designed to generate sound code that was consistent and readable. I think that experiment shows you what happens when you have a language so tight there is only one way to do anything. It has many strong features, but can be difficult to program. It's also very difficult for beginners, which I think illustrates your point about the low barrier to entry for PHP and Perl.



<h2>What Ruby has...</h2>

<ul>
<li>OO baked right in</li>
<li>Rails</li>
<li>Was there something else?</li>
</ul>

<p>I seem to remember that Ruby used to be compared to Perl by using the statement "Ruby is an object-oriented Perl" or something close to that.</p>

<p>I have been programming Perl for 1 year now. I and those I work with can look at my programs and see what is going on. Just because Perl can be used to write ecclectic line noise, doesn't mean you have to. I made a decision when I started my Perl would not be unreadable.</p>

<p>Ruby does five things much better than Perl.</p>

<p>Ruby blocks are very convenient.  There's a lot of goodness in making closure-passing simple, easy, and syntactically lightweight.  There's also a tremendous amount of goodness from making the language core aware of such constructs.</p>

<p>The strong built-in object orientation gives Ruby a lot of power too.  I credit Smalltalk.  Though I'm still unsure how I feel about the looks the append operator  in general, being able to declare objects that respond to it, or the subscripting operator, or whatever and using them in place of built-in objects as appropriate is very useful.  Sure, Perl has <code>tie</code>, but Ruby's approach is much better.</p>

<p>Of course, having open classes by default -- even the built-ins -- is also amazingly useful.</p>

<p>Ruby's threads are easier to use than even Perl 5.8's threads.  (I don't mean that sarcastically.)</p>

<p>Ruby's extension system is easier to use than Perl 5's extension mechanism.</p>

Ruby's a cute language for OO, if only for the easy of handling arguments. If I never have to type<br><br><code>my $self = shift;<br>my(@arg1, @arg2, @arg3) = @_;</code><br><br>again, I shall be a happy man. But sigillessness does not automagically imply readability, not by a long chalk. And every time I find myself doing: <code>results = [anobject.some_call].flatten</code> because ruby doesn't have context and the author of the framework I'm using didn't make the return signature of 'some_call' consistent across all subclasses... well... it's annoying.<br><br>Still, it's a cracking language.



<h2>Readable</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/scott1329/">scott1329</a> on 2005-11-19T17:43:58</h3>
Great post! I've been thinking about readable languages. It seems like the selling point of Ruby/Python/Java/etc is the code is more readable because it doesn't have built-in language support for regex syntax, therefore the code is more elegant looking because you don't have inline regular expressions. But these languages factor all that out into libraries, and as soon as you use the libraries, the code has regexes in it and looks about the same as Perl. The Ruby/Python/etc samples look clean and OO but if you do any real work with these languages, they'd look about the same as Perl does. Clumsier, because you have to make function calls to do what Perl does with operators that integrate into the I/O paradigm. $_ is not that complex. My gut feeling is the weird-syntax languages like Python will always lag, because PHP and Perl are like C and Java, and my brain can't handle multiple syntaxes easily. Programmers will use systems programming (C), application (Java), glue (Perl), and web (PHP) languages that are similar to prevent brain meltdown. Python is a return to the COBOL area A and B layouts. (I've tried using Python and don't like it much. But it has a 100% Java interpreter, which is sweet for embedding scripting languages, which is a win no other language even gets close to, except the weak JavaScript.) And no pure OO language has made much of an impact, so it's hard to see why Ruby will win on those grounds when Smalltalk tanked while C++ and Java thrived. This is a fascinating time of turmoil in the paradigm of what code looks like! I think in the future it'll look a lot like it does now. After all, I wrote a COBOL program last week! (Yucky, but it puts food on the table!)
