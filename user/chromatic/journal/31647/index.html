<p><p>The Perl 6 Design team met via phone on 15 November 2006. Larry, Damian, Allison, Patrick, Jesse, Nicholas, and chromatic attended. These are the  notes:</p>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>read through the objects notes from the hackathon</li>
<li>they were fantastic</li>
<li>I made some comments on those</li>
<li>going through Parrot Porters mail to catch up again</li>
<li>mostly caught up</li>
<li>will review some design proposals from Bob Rogers tonight</li>
<li>still working on the IO PDD</li>
<li>probably needs a lot more work, but I'll finish the two more things I
	  said it needed</li>
<li>we can work out things as we implement it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll take next week off to do Parrot hacking</li>
<li>obviously design documents</li>
<li>it'd be nice to work some code in there</li>
<li>maybe I'll work on Patrick's new PAST and POST for Punie</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it'll be much better then</li>
<li>I'm working on variables and arrays today</li>
<li>shortly after that, I'll work on loops</li>
<li>they're sort of useless without variables</li>
<li>tried to hang out online for the hackathon as much as possible</li>
<li>checked in the new PAST implementation</li>
<li>I really like it</li>
<li>I've played with it for the Perl 6 compiler and an implementation of bc</li>
<li>the implementation is fairly language independent</li>
<li>doesn't have too much Perl 6 stuff in the code generation</li>
<li>continuing to work on that and answer questions on the list</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>are there Parrot things that are blocking you?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>tracking down an oddity in Parrot</li>
<li>nothing blocks me so much, except that occasionally I have to back up</li>
<li>see the issue with the Capture PMC</li>
<li>it's a little frustrating to have so many workarounds</li>
<li>there's plenty to do</li>
<li>nothing is really blocking me per se</li>
<li>I'm filing these as bugs as we go</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Damian:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I solved the problem in the POD spec</li>
<li>will release the final draft today to p6l</li>
<li>that will include an implementation of the parser and Perldoc to XHTML
	  translator</li>
<li>the parser is very solid</li>
<li>easy to write translators</li>
<li>works nicely</li>
<li>still a little bit slow, but I'll optimize later</li>
<li>very pleased with how it's come together</li>
<li>the document itself is approximately 2000 lines long, all written in
	  POD6</li>
<li>very cool to see it turn into XHTML fairly robustly</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>still working full time</li>
<li>using Perl 6 on my job</li>
<li>trying to keep a finger in every pie that's out there</li>
<li>trying to make sure that things converge, rather than diverge</li>
<li>looking after Pugs stitching in the metaobject protocol and MiniPerl6</li>
<li>received an interesting mail from one of the authors of the Traits paper</li>
<li>he wants to know how we handle state conflicts</li>
<li>haven't responded to him yet</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>hackathon was a success</li>
<li>I fixed a lot of tests</li>
<li>we now have a new release out</li>
<li>we started with six Parrot hackers</li>
<li>by Saturday night, eight more people had contributed in some way</li>
<li>I'm curious to see what happens with the new Parrot release</li>
<li>I talked to Flavio and Audrey about what I might need to write a Parrot
	  emitter for MiniPerl6</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>they're pretty tired after the Brazil hackathon</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I figured so</li>
<li>they seemed pretty amenable, so I think we've resolved it</li>
</ul>
