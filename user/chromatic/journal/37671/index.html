<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 08 October 2008.  Larry, Allison, Patrick, Will, Jerry, Jesse, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>things are proceeding apace</li>
<li>spent most of the week either in Illinois or traveling to and from it</li>
<li>a really good conference, ACM Reflections/Projections</li>
<li>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</li>
<li>500 attendees, a wide variety of interesting speakers</li>
<li>gave two talks, good attendance</li>
<li>good hobnobbing with Al Aho too</li>
<li>think Awk, Dragon Book, regular expressions</li>
<li>he had some very good questions</li>
<li>had a great time naming the ten most influential programming languages over lunch</li>
<li>despite that, I also did a fair amount of hacking</li>
<li>wrote a little parse tree to AST transformer</li>
<li>thought it would be complicated</li>
<li>did it all pretty much with an <code>AUTOLOAD</code></li>
<li>basically comes out with a typed parse tree</li>
<li>I noticed some infelicities in the AST</li>
<li>some artificial nodes, particularly <code>in</code> nodes</li>
<li>just a leftover from the mechanism</li>
<li>I stole an idea from Haskell then</li>
<li>the <code>~</code> macro knows about parsing something between two delimiters</li>
<li>hacked that into the specs and <em>STD.pm</em></li>
<li>it seems to work now</li>
<li>cleans things up considerably, including the AST</li>
<li>allows for better error messages</li>
<li>in the talk on a derivative of APL that Morgan-Stanley uses, Q, I noticed the ability to do something missing in Perl 6</li>
<li>the <code>...</code> infix operator iteratively applies a function to the tail of a list as it's generated</li>
<li>now it's trivial to implement Fibonacci</li>
<li>lots of hanging out on the mailing lists and IRC</li>
<li>keeping people feeling like they know what's going on</li>
<li>a bunch of bug fixes</li>
<li>more accurate parsing of goal-oriented constructs, such as the end of argument processing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>merged in the MMD branch this week</li>
<li>has been a big thing for the past longer-than-it-should-have-taken</li>
<li>a couple of issues in some languages after the merge</li>
<li>most of them will be resolved by dispatch system cleanup</li>
<li>there are two dispatch systems, <code>PCCINVOKE</code> and the old <code>runops_from_c</code> system</li>
<li>a few strange issues like results registers not existing when you try to access them</li>
<li>caused some segfaults</li>
<li>Andrew and I will try to rush through the first two items and merge that back as soon as possible</li>
<li>should resolve some issues in Rakudo</li>
<li>seems to be what's left after we fixed the other problems</li>
<li>also starting the IO milestone branch</li>
<li>talked to Simon Peyton-Jones in the UK about some of the stuff we're doing with concurrency and encapsulated dispatch CPS</li>
<li>didn't plan to meet with him, but my advisor called him over</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>two focuses this week</li>
<li>getting HLL type mapping to work in Parrot and PCT</li>
<li>language translators need to run in their own namespace</li>
<li>Stephen Weeks has helped out in a big way</li>
<li>should open up quite a few avenues for development and make other things easier</li>
<li>a longstanding issue was moving some of the compiler tools to Parrot's model of namespace handling</li>
<li>until now, they used a flat namespace</li>
<li>we're almost ready to merge that branch back in to trunk</li>
<li>then we can put Rakudo and Cardinal into their own HLL namespaces</li>
<li>then we can do HLL typemapping</li>
<li>an integer PMC in Parrot will map to a Perl6Int rather than an Integer PMC</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I thought a discussion in Copenhagen had Allison saying that that automapping shouldn't happen</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's not cross-language type conversion</li>
<li>inside of Parrot, in PIR, if I have an Integer constant promoted into an object, what kind of object should it become?</li>
<li>that depends on the active HLL</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's not really a coersion</li>
<li>"in this context, Integers autobox to this type of PMC"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>each HLL gets to decide how to autobox low level types</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>is this in PCT?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>yes</li>
<li>but in the process, we find places where Parrot doesn't do what we want</li>
<li>I file tickets for those</li>
<li>because of the MMD merge, Rakudo is failing 74 new tests, most of them due to the Complex PMC</li>
<li>a little regression there</li>
<li>I'm sure the problem is the <code>IM</code> and <code>RE</code> macros</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm not sure</li>
<li>in theory, it's actually dispatching to the proxy complex object within the Perl 6 complex object</li>
<li>it may be there's a problem still with <code>Object</code></li>
<li>it still uses the old dispatch for subroutines within C</li>
<li>I've manually updated them to the new approach and it fixes them</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I traced it in <code>gdb</code></li>
<li>I get to the appropriate sub and the <code>RE</code> macro doesn't get the right value</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll try updating Complex to remove those and see if that does it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>on my way to Portland to give a hands-on Rakudo presentation tonight</li>
<li>I may be able to get them passing by the time I arrive</li>
<li>but I can explain them away</li>
<li>we'd like to get them passing before PPW</li>
<li>it's probably time to make the spectests in Rakudo the default <code>make test</code> target</li>
<li>spent my week trying to get <code>is export</code> to work</li>
<li>found a few rabbitholes along the way</li>
<li>added the apostrophe and other identifiers to the grammar</li>
<li>added some magical <code>$*</code> variables based on a contribution</li>
<li>ran into a problem where namespaces aren't working properly</li>
<li>Patrick's looking at that</li>
<li>Jeff Horwitz found something similar when working on mod_perl6</li>
<li>glad to see the MMD branch merge</li>
<li>but some of the failures make it harder to see if I broke anything</li>
<li>would like to see that cleaned up in the next couple of days</li>
<li>or we'll mark those tests as TODO for PPW so that we have clean results</li>
<li>I have the next release on the 18th</li>
<li>one of my targets is to get 4500 Perl 6 tests working</li>
<li>we're at 4300 now, with the failures</li>
<li>it's a reasonable target</li>
<li>will be attending PPW</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>my focus for PPW is Rakudo</li>
<li>trying to get people to contribute code or test suites</li>
<li>I'll conduct sessions to walk people through the steps they need to contribute to either or both</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>moved <a href="http://code.google.com/p/partcl/">Partcl</a> out of the Parrot repository into its own repository</li>
<li>sent out URLs and notifications</li>
<li>that'll give me a way to target a very specific version of Parrot</li>
<li>rather than working against what's currently in HEAD</li>
<li>should give me the ability to make more progress</li>
<li>have made some, but not as much as the infrastructure changes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>probably won't be here next week</li>
<li>what do people need?</li>
<li>okay, that was quiet</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Larry, you mentioned that the <code>.match</code> method sets its caller's <code>$/</code>, is that correct?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>yes</li>
<li>it seems consistent</li>
<li>essentially an implementation routine for if you use it directly</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Allison, on the calling conventions page, the <code>:lookahead</code> option isn't there</li>
<li>is that an oversight?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's there in a sense of "What's this going to do?"</li>
<li>do you have a ticket for what we talked about in Copenhagen?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I thought the notion of using a Capture-like object for the calling conventions is a big plus</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's done</li>
<li>but not pervasive throughout the system yet</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>can I put a note in there "don't forget about <code>:lookahead</code>"?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there are no details about what it should do or how</li>
<li>add to it or create and link to a ticket</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the design seems okay to me</li>
<li>I'm looking more for an implementation than anything else</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>p6l has gone off about rationals and floating point numbers</li>
<li>seems to have lost all basis of rationality of implementation</li>
<li>not sure that any implementor has commented on it</li>
<li>was that intentional?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>on my part, yes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll describe what Rakudo does and what the spec says, but I avoid discussions as to what Perl 6 <em>should</em> be doing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>notice the spec hasn't changed</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that said, I agree with the notion that Parrot's Integer should have BigInt semantics without having to change its type</li>
<li>not that it's always a BigInt, but it could seamlessly change from the default Integer type without having to change its type</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that might solve our horrible problems with the overflow code</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I know that Allison mentioned on IRC that morphing maybe should go away</li>
<li>it has problems with subclassing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Perl 6's view is that it's always a BigInt</li>
<li>it can cheat on a faster storage format if it can</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Rakudo has a similar view</li>
<li>the morphing issue...</li>
<li>Rakudo may end up with its own PMCs for everything</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I expected that from the start</li>
<li>one of the ways an HLL customizes the virtual machine is by providing its own PMCs</li>
<li>we ended up with a lot of PMCs for some reason</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it would be nice if Parrot supported that natively</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it'd be nice to have a vtable swapping technique that let us get rid of all of those switch statements</li>
<li>it's just a table full of function pointers</li>
<li>we can avoid morphing in some cases</li>
<li>take the Key PMC for example</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>getting rid of morphing would be nice</li>
<li>some MMD default variants that set native numbers morph Integers into Floats transparently</li>
<li>the Integer overflow code is broken</li>
<li>mostly the problem is that it's doing direct MMD rather than a vtable call</li>
<li>a vtable call would let BigInt override some of those vtable functions</li>
<li>would resolve a lot of problems there</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>signed integer overflow is undefined in C</li>
<li>64-bit Irix bit me</li>
<li>unsigned overflow is well-specified</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>are any of the <code>n_*</code> opcodes sticking around?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>a few</li>
<li>the ones that didn't have a funky alternate dispatch system</li>
<li>I didn't modify them because they caused test failures</li>
<li>assume they're going away</li>
<li><code>not</code> and <code>abs</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>and <code>neg</code>, or one other one too</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>do we need to deprecate them?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we'll do that in the calling conventions cleanup</li>
<li>when I deprecated them, I think I said "all <code>n_*</code> ops"</li>
</ul></p>
