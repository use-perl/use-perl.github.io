<p><strong>Teaching the Silicon to Talk:</strong>
<blockquote>The book went into production a day early.  So far, I've approved (and fixed the numbering of) the figures and illustrations, clarified some weird formatting things, and am waiting for the next stage.  I don't know what or when.  It will jump out from behind a chair and yell "SURPRISE YOU ARE NOT YET FINISHED!" and I will devote another five minutes to hitting things.  Mostly keys.
</blockquote>
<strong>Reliability:</strong>
<blockquote>
I've just finished writing an article for <a href="/user/Simon/"</a> at <a href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl.com</a> on software testing with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Test-Simple">Test::More</a>.  Expect it shortly, unless he hates my vegetable analogies.
</blockquote>
<strong>We Can End This Chapter, Anyway, Anyway...:</strong>
<blockquote>
Tomorrow will be devoted to updating my resume and thinking about getting in touch with the last place to offer me a job.  It's all the way across the country, which has its own unique set of challenges and rewards.  I broached the subject with aformentioned friend who lives in the vicinity, and there was a distinctive lack of horrified screaming.
<p>
If that sounds somewhat wishy-washy on my part, it's because I'm terribly confused by several things.  Having not worked a Regular Job for 18 months, my perspective is a little skewed.  Besides that, I grew up, more or less.  It's weird to wake up one day and realize you're an adult, but at least it happened before I hit 30.
</blockquote>
Next up:  tests for CPAN.pm.  Yow.</p>
