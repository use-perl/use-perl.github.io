<p><p>I've a lot of small projects to finish.  That tends not to stop me from taking on more work.  Fortunately, I've continued to be productive lately.</p>

<p>Wednesday night, at a post-<a href="http://www.yapc.org/America/">YAPC</a> party, <a href="/user/acme/">Leon</a> gave me permission to upload yet another <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Acme&mode=module">Acme</a> module.  I already have <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?m=module&q=Acme%3A%3APr0n">Acme::Pr0n</a>.  It is with great pleasure that I announce <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?m=module&q=Acme%3A%3AIncorporated">Acme, Inc.</a>, a module that replaces your boring old modules with shiny new modules from Acme, Inc.  You might remember this as the company that produces all of the nifty toys in the old Road Runner cartoons.</p>

<p>Thursday, on the plane, I wrote several bits of documentation for <a href="http://wgz.org/chromatic/jellybean/">Jellybean</a> in anticipation of an impending release.  Before that happens, however, there must be a new release of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?m=module&q=CGI%3A%3ASimple">CGI::Simple</a> (not my job; I've already sent the author a code and test patch) and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?m=module&q=Text%3A%3AWikiFormat">Text::WikiFormat</a>.  The latter is my responsibility, though I am waiting for feedback from (my approximately only user) <a href="/user/kake/">Kake</a> to see how well it passes her tests.  It also needs a documenation update.</p>

<p>Yesterday was a day of severe jet-lag, though I did whittle down my work inbox quite nicely.  It was at 0 messages before I left and is somewhere around 25 now.  That's workable.  Processing any more would have required much more brainpower than I had.  As you'd expect, it was a day without coding.</p>

<p>Today has been pretty laid-back, though I did get the basics of Mail::TempAddress in place.  It has 5 customer tests and 80-plus programmer tests.  All of them pass.  It only creates new temporary addresses at the moment, but that requires just enough framework that adding the other few features is very simple.  There's one remaining Mail::* hack in mind and I hope to get to it soon.</p>

<p>
Another nice thing I did was to automate the process of creating a new test file.  I now have a little program that writes out all of the boilerplate I usually use.  It saves a minute or so of typing.  Since it took about two minutes to write, it'll pay off within the week.
</p>

<p>If you need a moral to the story, how about "resolve to automate things you really should automate"?</p></p>
