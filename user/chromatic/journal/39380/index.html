<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 03 June 2009.  Larry, Allison,
Patrick, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>a radix-based number with bad digits fails now, instead of silently producing the wrong answer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>returns a Failure at runtime?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>at runtime, if it's not knowable at compile-time</li>
<li>playing with declarators <code>need</code> and <code>define</code>, what <code>use</code> uses</li>
<li><code>need</code> just pulls in modules</li>
<li>changed the spelling of "MONKEY_PATCHING" to "MONKEY_TYPING" because it spells funnier</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>is that what we get when we end up with the results of Shakespeare?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's why it's funny</li>
<li>MONKEY_TYPING you end up with random results</li>
<li>worked on the semantics of <code>$!</code></li>
<li>documented how action tags work with sharp equals</li>
<li>refactored viv's action routines for operator precedence reduction</li>
<li>the opp reduces things and rearranges nodes</li>
<li>has to get those right to allow correct translation down the road</li>
<li>STD now disallows the parenthesized form of rand as a term</li>
<li>don't want people thinking of it that way</li>
<li><code>use v6</code> now allows a version number</li>
<li>unified the trait mod categories</li>
<li>switched my cursor5 implementation</li>
<li>now implements actions as specified, converging with Rakudo which is a good thing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's been an interesting week</li>
<li>lots of different things</li>
<li>started playing around with Parrot's support to build against an installed version</li>
<li>looks promising</li>
<li>ready to make those conversions -- build against a build tree or an installed tree</li>
<li>we'll have that for the next release (Rakudo #18)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we can finally make Rakudo packages</li>
<li>that'll make people happy</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>had a lot of relevant posts talking about Rakudo's speed on a simple increment loop</li>
<li>the increment took an incredibly long period of time</li>
<li>had a lot of discussion in #parrot</li>
<li>turned out that our initial ideas weren't correct</li>
<li>it was <code>postfix:++</code> in Rakudo being incredibly slow</li>
<li>refactored that to make it faster</li>
<li>that was incredibly difficult, for many reasons</li>
<li>I did work that out</li>
<li>the autoincrement operator is now 80% faster than it was</li>
<li>that just tells you how slow it was</li>
<li>it's not <em>fast</em> now, but it's a lot faster</li>
<li>it has to return the value before the increment takes place</li>
<li>you have to clone it before you increment it</li>
<li>that clone routine was incredibly expensive</li>
<li>it's expensive in the general case</li>
<li>you may be cloning something with attributes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Perl 5 optimizes that to a pre-increment in void context</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I don't know how to detect that in Rakudo now</li>
<li>probably needs to take place at the compiler level</li>
<li>I could optimize that</li>
<li>also turns out that doing <code>isa</code> checks are incredibly expensive</li>
<li>we had an optimization to check if it's an Int</li>
<li>but that optimization slows it down</li>
<li>Parrot's <code>isa</code> opcode always creates a new ProxyPMC on every call</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that was kinda crazy</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we'd fixed that for <code>new</code> and other things</li>
<li>there was a case that leaked through in a specific order of optimizations</li>
<li>Julian and I have cleaned that up for good, at least until core PMCs live outside of the root Parrot namespace</li>
<li>that lookup occurs right there now</li>
<li>Rakudo treats Parrot's integers and floats like Ints and Nums</li>
<li>we didn't have HLL mapping</li>
<li>I tried to add HLL mapping, but that slows things down by a factor of three currently</li>
<li>we do it at runtime now</li>
<li>we'll live with the shadowing for a while longer</li>
<li>Vasily helped me improve parsing speed as we can translate most programs to iso-8859-1 form</li>
<li>tried this before, but there was a bug in comparing STRING hash keys between iso-8859-1 and UTF-8</li>
<li>tried converting to UCS-2, but there's a bug in numeric conversions there</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>and you require ICU</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that too</li>
<li>managed to get the Latin-1 conversion working</li>
<li>Vasily fixed the one bug remaining there</li>
<li>that gave us parsing speed improvements for spectests which contain Latin-1 characters</li>
<li>quite a few spectests contain non-breaking spaces</li>
<li>quite a few contain <em>one</em> non-breaking space, between <code>Perl</code> and <code>5</code></li>
<li>that single space meant we couldn't convert to ASCII for parsing, which made it slow</li>
<li>the <em>assign.t</em> test went from taking 2 minutes to 30 seconds</li>
<li>all of which was due to one non-breaking space in a comment in that file</li>
<li>fixed up symbol imports, importing from other modules</li>
<li>specifically from the <code>Setting</code></li>
<li>the previous code didn't work quite right</li>
<li>discovered that when moving things into the <code>Setting</code></li>
<li>we can move even more stuff from pure PIR code there now</li>
<li>closed about eight tickets yesterday</li>
<li>fixed handling of method calls in self in a method</li>
<li><code>$.method()</code> through the accessor interface now works correctly</li>
<li>figured out but haven't implemented <code>BEGIN</code></li>
<li>changing how Rakudo tracks <code>ro</code> versus <code>rw</code></li>
<li>shouldn't be too big a refactor</li>
<li>updating the postcircumfix brackets and braces code (needed it anyway)</li>
<li>fixing those will mean that I can fix autovivification of array and hash elements</li>
<li>an ongoing bug in Rakudo</li>
<li>will allow us to make lazy Ranges</li>
<li>they're currently quite eager</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>working on the PIR book</li>
<li>almost finished with the last chapter now</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you probably need me on that soon</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll be gone for a week</li>
<li>will hand them off to you for editing</li>
<li>did some more Debian packaging work</li>
<li>someone wanted it to work on Debian GNU/FreeBSD</li>
<li>looks like a quick config change was necessary there</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>working on a grant proposal to write PIR-level profiling tools</li>
<li>fixing memory leaks</li>
<li>working on performance</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we desperately need that PIR profiler</li>
<li>the simple loop case, for example</li>
<li>the problem turned out where nobody expected it</li>
<li>it took me an hour to find it</li>
<li>I'm concerned about calling conventions landing before 1.4</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm not sure it is</li>
<li>at the moment, the most critical thing for 1.4 is to build from an installed Parrot</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm comfortable that that will happen</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's my top priority</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Rakudo is close</li>
<li>Tcl is doing it now; once again Tcl has paved the way</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Tcl still can't build if you remove the build directory</li>
<li>I'm pretty sure we can do that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I should report for Jonathan</li>
<li>he did impressive stuff this week</li>
<li>he re-wrote Rakudo's dispatcher</li>
<li>method dispatch avoids Parrot right now</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's intentionally overrideable</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the fact that it's working is impressive</li>
<li>our dispatcher now handles MMD issues</li>
<li>some of the other funny things Parrot's default dispatch can't do</li>
<li>our bottleneck now is parameter passing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>marshalling and unmarshalling?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>also type checking</li>
<li>we want to do that in C instead of in PIR</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you don't have the hooks to do that at the C level?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>right</li>
<li>unmarshalling may use a dynop</li>
<li>whatever we build today will blow up when the calling conventions at the C level change</li>
<li>I'll work on getting an installable Rakudo against an installable Parrot</li>
<li>in a week, it'll either work or I'll have a list of things we need to resolve</li>
<li>we want to have that a week before the 1.3 release</li>
<li>I'll prioritize that</li>
<li>hopefully that'll free Allison up for other things</li>
<li>if you check in what you have on the calling conventions branch, maybe c and others can start on it</li>
<li>it's not a killer if that doesn't land by 1.4</li>
<li>it'll hurt</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it pushes them out to 2.0</li>
<li>we can check them in in 1.5</li>
<li>but it pushes them out of packaged releases until 2.0</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we'll work against 1.5 etc</li>
<li>but Jonathan will have to work around things</li>
<li>last week I asked about semicolon versus comma in <code>zip</code></li>
<li>now I ask about it in postcircumfix brackets</li>
<li>that is, <code>@a[1,2,3]</code> versus <code>@a[1;2;3]</code></li>
<li>how does it see them differently?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's a good argument for me to reverse my previous decision</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I didn't think about it until last night</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>... a single slice in one dimension</li>
<li>something has to tell us whether there were semicolons</li>
<li>last week's answer is no longer operative</li>
<li>recursive descent looks in there for statements in STD</li>
<li>we have the tree nodes to deal with that</li>
<li>... but how it's represented at runtime</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>is <code>rand()</code> now a function call?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>to a non-existent function</li>
<li><code>rand</code> is a term parsed like <code>pi</code> or <code>e</code></li>
<li>it's a term that returns a different result when evaluated</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>if I have a string that looks like a radix coversion without the closing brackets</li>
<li>someone numifies that</li>
<li>do I get back 0 or a Failure of some sort?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>if it had its final bracket truncated, it may have had trailing numbers truncated too</li>
<li>bad number</li>
<li>it ought to fail</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>what's the criteria for that?</li>
<li>string-to-number conversions convert what they can and ignore the rest</li>
<li>if I had a string that started with <code>:2</code> and didn't match, what'd I get back?</li>
<li>same question for things that look Complex but really aren't</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we want to distinguish things that are malformed from things with trailing garbage</li>
<li>if you have a base-ten number with trailing alphanumerics, you ought to return a number with a warning</li>
<li>other than that, my feeling is a Failure</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I can make a prototype</li>
<li>we should figure out where we should fail</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>if you're going to do a numeric conversion and nothing looks numeric, that should be a warning</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we can warn on any conversion that doesn't look like a number</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's in the spec somewhere</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>numifying a string that doesn't contain anything numeric-looking produces a warning</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the spec only allows leading and trailing whitespace</li>
<li>you get a warning otherwise, at least</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>would you get that same warning for <code>123 Easy Street</code>?</li>
<li>you get extra stuff besides the number?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>yes</li>
<li>may want to distinguish that from a malformed number</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I like that</li>
<li>we can try it and see how it works</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>do you want to blow up the rocket now or later?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I can see people wanting an adverb that says "I don't care!"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's <code>try</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>PHP has the prefix-@ which suppresses the error you'd otherwise get</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I've thought about something like that</li>
<li>"I know I'll get an error, but throw it away"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I can always do <code>expr // 0</code></li>
<li>but I want something short -- one character long</li>
<li><code>try</code> is a little long</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><code>\</code> is available</li>
<li>more inclined for a prefix listy thing to suppress errors from its arguments</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>upside-down exclamation point!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>mix that with complex numbers</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the idea came up of getting swag with Camelia on them</li>
<li>that's interesting</li>
<li>but there may be a perceived conflict with TPF on that</li>
<li>thinking of doing the same thing for the Rakudo-pseudo logo</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>just committed my outstanding changes to the PCC rewiring branch</li>
<li>not all tests pass</li>
</ul></p>
