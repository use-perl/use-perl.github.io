<p>One important difference between programming and music is that in programming, correctness often supersedes aesthetics.  It's not that aesthetics are unimportant, or that there can or should be no joy in programming -- but if your code doesn't work, it doesn't matter how much of a punk fringe rock star you consider yourself.</p>

<p>Color me (what, two nods to my pseudonym in two paragraphs?) uninspired.  I doubt improv will pass my test suite.  See <a href="http://www.idlewords.com/2005/04/dabblers_and_blowhards.htm">Dabblers and Blowhards</a> for a deeper debunking of similarly silly comparisons.</p></p>

<h2>Programming is Like Pudding</h2>

<p>
Excellent point. Having come from a fine-art background myself I have always been annoyed with these types of comparisons, because they almost always miss the ways in which programming is actually like $something_that_is_not_programming. Especially high level comparisons like this, they always fail once you look at the details. Fact is that programming, like <i>anything you do</i>, can be an aesthetic act if you choose to make it one.

<p>Well, maybe the comparison fails when you drill down to details. So be it. They're not the same thing.</p><p>But the interesting thing about the comparison is that you keep two thoughts or concepts in your head and then suddenly discover new ideas in one or the other which you <i>didn't think of before</i>.</p><p>If that's all you get out of the exercise, that's still plenty.</p>

<p>In a way I agree with you. I's annoying when the details don't match and people still keep trying to infer <i>too much</i> from the analogy when some things clearly <i>aren't they same</i>.</p><p>It's like the tired, programming-isn't-like-building-a-house/bridge/brick wall analogy, as if these things are completely well known and explored and repeatable whereas software development isn't. Usually stated by programmers who don't know how to do either of these other things.</p><p>I once read a thread on Reddit that went down this route, and I just loved it when someone who knew how to build a house responded and demolished the analogy with actual facts. And then someone who knew about bridges did the same. And then someone wrote a long post about how difficult brick laying was.</p>

<h2>improv amd test</h2>

<p>Actually, streching the analogy a little, you could liken improv to making your test suite test for some unlikely/scary test cases no one in their right mind would think of, in which case it might indeed improve it. Or you might think instead that a perfectly logical and rational mind should come up with evry meaningful teat case in which case I guess the analogy breaksdown completely... your pick<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;--)</p><p>For me though, one of the great joys of having modules on CPAN is having people contact me with questions and learning all the things they do with the tools I built that my limited imagination would never, ever, have came up with. That is very far from the joy you get with music, I guess, I am not a musician myself, but its a great joy nevertheless. Akin to what Stradivarius might have felt, "toutes proportions garde'es". (how come I can't use UTF-8 in my messages BTW?)

<p>I don't understand why some people vigorously defend the untenable position that programming is art.  There can be artistry involved and it is often a creative practice, but what's wrong with considering programming a craft?</p>

Well if we go with Wilde's idea that "All art is quite useless" which expands to basically say that art exists only to be beautiful so cannot have a use as that would spoil the beauty of it, then all of Acme:: would be art? And everything else a craft?
</p><p>
To be serious though, the problem I have is being able to define "art" and then define "craft" based on that. Art has be defined and redefined over the centuries and will continue to be so and at this point I think Wilde's idea is pretty much completely outdated in the contemporary art scene of today. What is to stop you from using a module that I have written as an act of performance art? Would your using it suddenly nullify my artistic intent? Tis a slippery slope full of lots of slippery bullsh*t, but hey this is art!

A plain chair is functional.  A filigreed throne is also functional, but it contains art.  Similarly, you can use a piece of cardboard to shim a wobbly table, or a Botticelli, but that doesn't make the Botticelli not art.</p><blockquote><div><p> <em>To be serious though, the problem I have is being able to define "art" and then define "craft" based on that.</em></p></div> </blockquote><p>Right.  Don't do that.</p><p>There's no strict taxonomic relationship between art and craft.  Each can contain the other.  I don't want to fall into the philosophical pit of utilitarianism, but sometimes it's useful.</p>

<p>Yes! This is quite funny to me as it hadn&#8217;t occur to me to think of it that way. But in a sense it clearly is, or at least can be. Most of it is equivalent to a crayon scrawl more than to a Rembrandt, though.</p>

<p>You're probably right, especially when it comes to really good art.  Too many novices believe that natural talent obviates the need to practice their crafts.  I certainly did, as a beginning writer.</p>

<h2>design vs. construction</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ChrisDolan/">ChrisDolan</a> on 2008-07-20T18:18:30</h3>
<p>My personal favorite high-level comparison (which I first heard discussed in depth by <a href="http://nealford.com/" title="nealford.com">Neal Ford</a nealford.com>) contrasts programming to civil engineering.</p><p>In civil engineering (e.g. bridge building), construction costs dramatically outweigh design costs.  Civil engineers aren't cheap, but their proportional cost relative to the bridge materials and construction labor are small.</p><p>In contrast, the construction steps in software are largely automated: compilation, packaging, making installers, downloading, installing.  Your program is just the blueprint.  Consequently, software is the engineering field where the design vs. construction cost is most heavily skewed towards design.  Since cost of design is usually less predicatible than cost of construction, software development as an engineering disipline is less predictable than other engineering niches.</p><p>I think that design-centric quality is what makes software compared to art more often than other engineering fields.  Architecture, being more design-focused, often is recognized for its artistic qualities too.  Just as software design is much more than pretty GUIs, architecture is much more than pretty buildings.</p>

<blockquote><div><p> <em>Just as software design is much more than pretty GUIs, architecture is much more than pretty buildings.</em></p></div> </blockquote><p>Architecture is also a craft though.  It doesn't matter how pretty anyone considers the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Public_Service_Building" title="wikipedia.org">Portland Building</a wikipedia.org> or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata_Center" title="wikipedia.org">Stata Center</a wikipedia.org> if the buildings don't actually work.</p><p>Compare that to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rite_of_Spring" title="wikipedia.org">The Rite of Spring</a wikipedia.org>, which I don't like, but few would claim it doesn't meet the definition of art due to any functional flaws (and what are those anyway, dissonant bassoons?).  De gustibus non est disputandum, tamen de laboratum est disputandum.  (You <em>can</em> judge Latin on its functional properties, especially when I use it.)</p>
