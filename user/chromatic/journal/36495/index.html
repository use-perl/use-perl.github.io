<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 21 May 2008.  Larry, Allison,
Patrick, Jerry, Will, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>working on the exceptions migration</li>
<li>finished the last half of that</li>
<li>debugging failing tests now</li>
<li>I have eight failing tests</li>
<li>narrowed it down to three basic problems</li>
<li>had a question for Patrick on that</li>
<li>continuations taken on labels in the middle of a subroutine make very poor exception handlers</li>
<li>independent subroutines work much better</li>
<li>the problem is that <code>setjmp</code>/<code>longjmp</code> isn't stable or guaranteed to be stable in the spec</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that only surprises me if you're using a bad platform with an awful compiler</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><code>longjmp</code> isn't guaranteed to restore all of your variables properly</li>
<li>we're seeing memory corruption when we restore</li>
<li>we're ready for language testing on that branch</li>
<li>the places where this is a problem is throwing exceptions from C</li>
<li>throwing exceptions from within PIR is fine</li>
<li>it just inserts an exception handler as the next op in the runloop</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>released Parrot 0.6.2 yesterday; seems fine so far</li>
<li>improved performance in Parrot yet again</li>
<li>ran out of time over the weekend to work on concurrency</li>
<li>will apply open patches and check for bugs this weekend</li>
<li>scheduled my trip to YAPC::NA, will be at the Parrot hackathon both days but not the post-conference hackathon</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>did some work on mod_parrot on a branch</li>
<li>rewriting the configure system to improve portability</li>
<li>some good progress there</li>
<li>added a couple of Perl 6 spec tests</li>
<li>modified a few to make them pass on Rakudo</li>
<li>talked to Moritz about a make target for just passing spectests</li>
<li>it's <code>make spectest_regression</code></li>
<li>should get you noiseless, all-passing spec tests</li>
<li>they run through fudge for now, but eventually we'll take that out</li>
<li>trying to get back into Perl 6 development, but I can't keep up with Jonathan and Patrick</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>now you know how I felt!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll stick with the tests</li>
<li>GSoC starts in earnest within a couple of weeks anyway</li>
<li>want to make sure that all of the students have what they need</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>took a side trip to Japan</li>
<li>gave my talk there on the current state of the parser</li>
<li>why and how we're making it extensible</li>
<li>continue to work on the parser to make language derivation more real</li>
<li>revamped the quoting to use real sublanguages and get all the mixins to work right</li>
<li>I Moose-ified the STD5 implementation</li>
<li>now does mixins correctly</li>
<li>now parsed double-quotes for escape sequences and properly returns a <code>Match</code> object</li>
<li>now working on regexes as a sublanguage</li>
<li>thinking how terminators match</li>
<li>the old recursive-descent parsing was kind of brittle</li>
<li>switched it to use the operator precedence parser</li>
<li>figured out that I could reuse the same one by supplying different term and infix expectations in the subgrammar</li>
<li>that effectively hides the parts of the regular grammar that you don't want to see</li>
<li>you don't have normal regular expressions popping out where you don't want them</li>
<li>there's no reason not to use the regular operator precedence table for that</li>
<li>don't have to worry about propagating terminators down so that they stop on double vertical bars</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>PGE does the same thing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it looks cleaner</li>
<li>but it's untested</li>
<li>if the operator precedence parser works on regular Perl, it'll work on the real thing</li>
<li>the benefits of longest-token matching still work too</li>
<li>there are occasions where I don't want to derive a sublanguage just for a different quote terminator</li>
<li>playing with a single hard-wired stop pattern passed in from the dynamic scope</li>
<li>may need a start pattern so I can have nested brackets</li>
<li>should suffice for quoting needs without multiplying grammars for every different delimiter</li>
<li>instead of the preprocessor rewriting protoregexes, the standard grammar looks at protoregex data and rewrites it on the fly</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>had end of semester grading and stuff</li>
<li>that distraction is gone</li>
<li>created a new metaobject model on top of Parrot</li>
<li>makes Parrot objects act like Perl 6 objects &mdash; <code>.HOW</code> and <code>.WHAT</code> methods</li>
<li>follow Perl semantics, not necessarily derived from a common base</li>
<li>gives a nice consistency to the toolset</li>
<li>PCT and PGE use that model now</li>
<li>that went quick</li>
<li>Jonathan and I are converting Rakudo to that model now</li>
<li>finding other updates in the process</li>
<li>seems to be going well</li>
<li>closing tickets, applying patches, answering questions</li>
<li>figured out an approach to solving scalars in Rakudo</li>
<li>will help with list assignment and list context</li>
<li>a new PMC type for the base class of mutables</li>
<li>we can attach properties to that</li>
<li>figured out how to clean up class relationships in PGE</li>
<li>need to refactor PGE</li>
<li>that helped me figure out how to implement protoregexes</li>
<li>that'll help us implement more of the standard grammar</li>
<li>not a complete longest token matching implementation</li>
<li>but it'll get us closer</li>
<li>need to refactor the operator precedence parser slightly</li>
<li>needs more introspection to make scalar assignment propagate context appropriately</li>
<li>not a minor refactor; PGE uses operator precedence parser to parse things</li>
<li>a fair amount of changes to PGE over the next couple of weeks</li>
<li>I don't expect any external impacts</li>
<li>our abstraction levels seem good to mitigate that</li>
<li>it's easy to change the world underneath without having to change things externally</li>
<li>no blockers at the moment, other than sleep</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>keeping an eye on the queue</li>
<li>trying to stay active on IRC</li>
<li>trying to get some people fill out CLAs and get commit bits</li>
<li>want to make sure we keep good patch submitters happy</li>
<li>some grant committee work this week, nothing particularly Perl 6-y</li>
<li>blocking on time</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>how much do you depend on exception handlers being set as continuations within a subroutine?</li>
<li>how much would it hurt if they were separate subroutines?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'd have to update a lot of code in Tcl</li>
<li>that wouldn't kill me</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I like the way it works now</li>
<li>there could be reasons why that's not fully desirable</li>
<li>but it's really nice to have all of my registers in scope with labels as it is now</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>at the moment, exceptions thrown within C require <code>setjmp</code>/<code>longjmp</code> to get to where we can insert a new opcode within Parrot's runloop</li>
<li>that's fragile</li>
<li>most exception problems now come from that</li>
<li>this is the same problem as the continuation from different runloops problem</li>
<li><code>longjmp</code> doesn't know anything about the Parrot environment and doesn't restore it</li>
<li>that's the corruption problem</li>
<li>maybe the problem is how we handle Continuations</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I think the problem is with how we handle Continuations</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there aren't many places where I do exception handling</li>
<li>there may be a lot of handlers, but they're mostly in generated code</li>
<li>not hand-written code</li>
<li>might not need to update many places if exception handler as label goes away</li>
<li>then the question is "How do I get to the context I had where the exception occurred?"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>from my perspective, an exception handler is basically a block in the HLL</li>
<li>the same way you'd use <code>:outer</code> with a block</li>
<li>the outer is the enclosing sub in the HLL</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's basically lexicals then</li>
<li>anything I want to preserve into the exception handler, I have to stick into a lexical</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>yes</li>
<li>or rely on the information you insert into the exception itself</li>
<li>it can carry a payload</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>but we're talking about exceptions I didn't write</li>
<li>thrown from C</li>
<li>I can't put stuff into the payload there</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>what information do you want?</li>
<li>PIR information?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>and stuff in registers</li>
<li>if I create a class, there could be a "Class already exists!" exception</li>
<li>I branch around it</li>
<li>if there's an error, handle it elsewhere in the subroutine, then continue on</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's half-standard, when you write PIR</li>
<li>half of the ops return NULL</li>
<li>half of them throw exceptions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>is that an idiom because Parrot's exception handling doesn't work?</li>
<li><code>resume</code> hasn't ever really worked so far</li>
<li>if that worked, would that help?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that would solve some of them for me</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it would for me too</li>
<li>but sometimes I want to do other things, and then resume</li>
<li>I'd need to store stuff in lexicals to have access to them</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the classic model is where you catch an exception, change a value, and then resume</li>
<li>that's tricky to do with separate execution for handlers</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>about half of my stuff is that</li>
<li>mostly default handling</li>
<li>testing to avoid the exception in the first place is a lot more work than trapping and fixing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>and that makes exceptions less useful, as you want to take the hit only when an exceptional condition occurs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>and there are race conditions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>exception handlers as labels are useful, because you can call out to an external sub if you want</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we'll have to do some work on Continuations to call them from within C without breaking things horribly</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>before you go too far in looking at that, let me review where I use exceptions and how I use them to see what needs to change</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the confusion is between the HLL and C</li>
<li>they don't agree on how control flows</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>C is wrong</li>
<li>the minute you put C<setjmp> and C<longjmp> in there, you're wrong</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's what I thought when I saw them</li>
<li>I'll try to keep the ability to allow exception handlers at labels</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll look at how I handle C<return> from a PCT perspective</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>C<goto> in Perl 6 allows you to go to the original scope from the exception handler</li>
<li>the stack doesn't unwind until you tell it to</li>
<li>it's not impossible... if you can find the right label to go to</li>
<li>the C<goto> itself unwinds the stack</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>what happens when you do C<push_eh> now?</li>
<li>in trunk</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it pushes a Continuation object onto the general stack</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>when the exception occurs?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it pops it off the stack and invokes it</li>
<li>when you C<rethrow>, you push the exception back on the stack</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>anything that happens after you took that Continuation is still in effect when you get to that label</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>invoking a Continuation doesn't restore your entire environment</li>
<li>only certain pieces of the context</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it doesn't change register values back</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's not pure</li>
<li>in the sense of no side effects</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>how does the new one work?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it doesn't use the general stack at all</li>
<li>C<push_eh> adds a handler to the concurrency scheduler</li>
<li>like event handlers</li>
<li>when you invoke an exception, it searches through the concurrency scheduler's list of handlers</li>
<li>invocation hasn't changed at all</li>
<li>you'd store your exception information in the interpreter</li>
<li>then pull that into an Exception PMC</li>
<li>then throw that object</li>
<li>we've removed that interpreter structure part</li>
<li>superfluous</li>
<li>Continuation invocation hasn't changed at all</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>return exception returns a payload</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you control that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>how about C<next> and C<continue>?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>are they all subs?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>PCT doesn't presume that the body of a C<while> or C<for> loop is a sub</li>
<li>not all languages require that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I removed the idea of handler scope</li>
<li>the old implementation wasn't very good</li>
<li>my new idea is to store them in the context structure</li>
<li>they only exist in your own context</li>
<li>you attach those handlers to a block</li>
<li>if you throw an exception within that block, the handler for that block catches it</li>
<li>when you leave a context, the handler is no longer active</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that doesn't handle C<continue></li>
<li>have to stay in the loop</li>
<li>it skips the rest of the block</li>
<li>starts at the top again</li>
<li>C<continue> exits the block</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it hands control back to whatever controls the iteration?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I need the C<handled> and C<resume> opcodes to work properly</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the block catches it</li>
<li>the handler says "resume after everything else"</li>
<li>the ordinary control flow continues on the next iteration</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I need to think about it some more</li>
<li>I could really use a way to push a new level into a lexpad</li>
<li>some optimizations there</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Tcl has a C<continue></li>
<li>I'm not sure how it works under the hood</li>
<li>it lets you do things with control flow</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Lisp does too (CL?)</li>
<li>let's take this to the list</li>
<li>Bob Rogers has lots of practical experience doing this in Lisp</li>
<li>good to get more feedback</li>
</ul></p>
