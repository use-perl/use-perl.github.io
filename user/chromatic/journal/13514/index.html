<div class="span8">
<p><p>Nat quotes a few people saying "<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/gnat/journal/13512">If Perl 6 doesn't come soon, I'm giving up</a>."</p>

<p>There are dozens of people who've put in years of work on gobs of code that's <a href="http://www.parrotcode.org/">available</a> right <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=perl6&mode=all">now</a>.  There are <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/apocalypse/">large</a> <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/exegesis/">explanations</a> of the new features, the <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/pdd/">internals</a>, and the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perl6es/">whole process</a>.</p>

<p>Even with all of the changes and the new features, there are still thousands of <a href="http://qa.perl.org/">tests for Perl 5</a> that test features that will work the same way in Perl 6 that could be ported <em>right now</em> to Perl 6.</p>

<p>Perl 6 is a labor of love for Larry and Damian (and many others).  They could both be doing more lucrative work that doesn't do <em>you</em> any good.  There are loads of individuals and several companies who've contributed to <a href="http://www.perl-foundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a> to help pay for their time.</p>

<p>There are also plenty of people who aren't waiting around as if Larry were to speak from Mount Sinai &mdash; they're writing code now, they're answering questions now, they're asking questions now, and they're offering suggestions now.  They're writing documentation, reporting bugs, offering patches, finding new ways to make a proposed feature even better, and they're doing it now.</p>

<p>Maybe Perl 6 will come sooner if you help.  Write a test.  Write a paragraph of documentation.  Report a bug.  Submit a patch.  Donate an hour's worth of wages.  Pick one.  Pick any.</p>

<p>If Perl 6 doesn't come soon, you're welcome to give up.  So long.  Godspeed.  When Perl 6 is released, no one will have kept a list of people who walked away.  You're welcome to use it then.</p>

<p>If you're really interested in seeing Perl 6 happen sooner, though, and not just trying to make everyone sad or whatever, there's a place for you.</p></p>

<h2>Meaning what?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2003-07-17T20:09:59</h3>
<p>If Perl 6 doesn't come soon you're giving up on what?  Perl 6?  So what.  History is full of open source projects everyone gave up on that still came out pretty well.  Mozilla is a pretty amazing example.  Nobody thought a free UNIX would happen, either, and today we have several.  Giving up on Perl 6 isn't going to hurt anyone except yourself; go away and return when it's blooming, if that's how you feel.  (It's what I did.)  Meanwhile, keep using Perl 5, which is clearly not going anywhere.  It's even more clearly not going anywhere since the announcement of ponie.</p>

<p>Does that mean giving up on Perl in general?  Giving up on Perl 5?  That's silly.  What does the arrival or nonarrival of Perl 6 have to do with whether your existing Perl 5 work continues to function?  Anyone who said this and meant they were giving up on Perl totally is just a Perl bigot.  Probably just trying to spread FUD and get people to migrate to their favorite language.</p>

<p>Agreed, but I thought it would be more productive to say "Here's how you can make it arrive sooner" rather than "wah wah, whatever will we do without <em>you</em>, you twit!"  Sometimes I do care about the feelings of other people, even though they're wrong.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Ah, okay.  Point taken.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Personally, I believe the most important thing I did to make Perl 6 arrive sooner was to step out of the process.  But maybe I could have done a little more.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>

<h2>Perl6 vs. Perl5</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ethan/">ethan</a> on 2003-07-22T08:35:19</h3>
I think it should always be taken with a grain of salt what individuals say about the Perl6 development. Those are people who are mostly involved in this development themselves and therefore, quite understandably, could always do with a little help from more people.<br> <br>But Perl6 isn't all. There is still very active and interesting development going on with Perl5. Both Perl6 and Perl5 demand so much time that the developers seem to have divided into two parties: those working on Perl5 and those that create Perl6.<br> <br>In my case, I would have probably joined the Perl6ers, but it all started in the very wrong moment (for me anyway). I was just getting an idea of how Perl5 worked on the internals and started to become interested in XS, the perl5-porters etc.  Right now I don't want to go through all that again for Perl6...learning and understanding a large project from scratch is awfully hard, especially in case of Perl6 where the actual language and interpreter doesn't yet exist (or at least exists only in parts).<br> <br>There is one other thing that I start to foresee just now: Perl6 and Perl5 could lead a parallel life (at least for a couple of years). Perl5 is too mature and too rich to drop it in favour of Perl6. New and important features have found their way into the interpreter just very lately (think unicode, ithreads etc). And there is this huge bunch of perl5-porters who've taken over the development altogether on their own (Larry seems no longer to be part of the development). Who knows, in two years we may have two very good Perl languages and implementations living peacefully side-by-side.
