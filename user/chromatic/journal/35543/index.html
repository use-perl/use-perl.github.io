<p><p>I hate writing parsers, but much of the work Allison's asked me to do to revise the PMCs in Parrot has required modification and extension of a parser written in Perl 5 to turn our little language for describing PMCs into compilable C code.</p>

<p>The other day I realized that I could take 65 lines of generated code and turn it into 1 line of generated code by smartening the parser and re-using a function we already had elsewhere.  It works for built-in PMCs, but I think there may be a failure case for dynamic PMCs (though fixing that is fairly easy and will provide a nice speed improvement there too).</p>

<p>After thinking about the problem for a while, I decomposed the problem into a couple of function calls that transformed the data I had into the data I needed.  I didn't actually write the functions; I merely wrote their names, passed in their arguments, and received the data they returned.  After dinner, I started writing the functions.</p>

<p>Everything went well, until I realized that I had to keep looking back and forth at the functions and de-facto signatures (this is Perl 5 code) to remember what I passed in and what I received.</p>

<p>Score one for explicit signatures like you find in C.</p></p>

<p>Even only the names of the returned values would have been sufficient.</p>
