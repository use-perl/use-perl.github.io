<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 10 June 2009.  Larry, Patrick, Jerry,
Will, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>having some family business at the moment</li>
<li>reduced the precedence of adverbs from tighter than comma to tighter than item assignment</li>
<li>reduces the frequency of some FAQs</li>
<li>worked with Jonathan and others to nail down the notion that a named multimethod looks like a single object from outside</li>
<li>obviously multi from inside</li>
<li>if you declare a multi within a class and ask for a list of methods from outside, you only get that name once</li>
<li>discussed whether multimethods are interleaved like multisubs</li>
<li>they are not</li>
<li>they are only an implementation detail inside a given class</li>
<li>from outside the class, a method always appears to be a single routine</li>
<li>helps preserve encapsulation and sanity across language barriers</li>
<li>went over Pugs examples</li>
<li>ran them past STD; it coughed up a lot</li>
<li>fixed a lot of the problems</li>
<li>found a few infelicities in STD</li>
<li>a double-quoted string that ends with an interpolation of <code>$foo.</code>, like at the end of a sentence, the parser sees <code>$."</code> and tries to find a method name in double quotes</li>
<li>the next double quote might be many lines away</li>
<li>the dotty op at the end of a double-quoted string now disambiguates against a method name in quotes if there's whitespace before the next double quote</li>
<li>it terminates the string</li>
<li>that can really send the parser off on a wild goose chase</li>
<li>converged the output of gimme5 and viv more closely</li>
<li>viv can translate more of the operator precedence now</li>
<li>gimme5 was overcompensating to add a semicolon at the end of a <code>given</code> block</li>
<li>that was a fossil from when it used <code>do</code></li>
<li>now it uses 5.10's <code>given</code>/<code>when</code></li>
<li>cursor's implementation of <code>.cap</code> to return matches in order was buggy and lost some matches from <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statements</li>
<li>viv now translates <code>:delete</code> and <code>:exists</code></li>
<li>that was part of the reason for changing the precedence of adverbs</li>
<li>adverbs are now parsed into a real AST node</li>
<li>treated more like postfix</li>
<li>modifying the node in place makes it difficult to maintain the AST</li>
<li>the warning message about Perl 5 regex modifiers was overzealous</li>
<li>it interpreted letters with whitespace in between</li>
<li><code>if</code> appeared like a case-insensitive match</li>
<li>tightened up the error checker</li>
<li>added to my list of core types</li>
<li>thinking very hard about coercion and not so hard about trait auxiliaries</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>busy and productive week</li>
<li>worked on lots of little bug fixes</li>
<li>fixed <code>.get</code> and <code>.lines</code> to do the right thing: no extra lines, <code>Nil</code> when necessary</li>
<li>refactored postcircumfix brackets for the Positional role</li>
<li>it can do things in terms of itself</li>
<li>if you create a new class, you only need to define postcircumfix int</li>
<li>the others can define themselves in terms of it</li>
<li>you can define the others if you want, but you don't have to</li>
<li>had to update the handling of <code>Whatever</code> to return a closure</li>
<li>we were doing that for all operators except minus</li>
<li>that depended on getting postcircumfix fixed</li>
<li>ended up creating a new <code>WhateverCode</code> class</li>
<li>operators involving a <code>Whatever</code> return a <code>WhateverCode</code></li>
<li>we can multidispatch and do special things on that</li>
<li>don't know if it'll last permanently, but it works for now</li>
<li>refactored Rakudo's assignment to define it in terms of <code>.STORE</code></li>
<li>brings us a step closer to correct vivification of arrays and array elements</li>
<li>can write proxy objects which do the right thing</li>
<li>lots more discussion about various speed improvements in Parrot, especially with respect to IO</li>
<li>working on HLLCompiler</li>
<li>today working on making Rakudo work from an installed Parrot</li>
<li>Parrot does not make that simple</li>
<li>Vienna.pm has agreed to fund me for one Rakudo day per week in 2009, similar to what they have been doing for Jonathan</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>preparing for the Parrot Virtual Machine Workshop</li>
<li>will have more time to devote to Rakudo and Parrot during and after YAPC</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>nothing Perl 6ish</li>
<li>trying to encourage Parrot committers to blog their reports and not just put themon IRC</li>
<li>trying to write more regularly about Partcl</li>
<li>it's slowly returning to the peak passing rate</li>
<li>that's dropped quite a bit; been about six months since I've been able to do this on a regular basis</li>
<li>lots of memory limitations</li>
<li>I've been trying to write small test cases that demonstrate memory leaks</li>
<li>chromatic has fixed a lot of those</li>
<li>we've reclaimed a lot of tests since last week</li>
<li>tracked down a mismatch in Parrot and Tcl Unicode handling</li>
<li>have a workaround in place</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>fixing memory leaks in Parrot, Rakudo, and Tcl</li>
<li>there's a big one specific to a Rakudo dynop</li>
<li>the other big one is <code>Parrot_Context</code> recycling in Parrot</li>
<li>I have a plan, but it's tedious to get there</li>
<li>also editing the Parrot book</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Larry, what are you sending to the regexp engine on IRC?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>snowmen and comets</li>
<li>you can use them as delimiters... I don't know</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I don't know why it works</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>if you start it with a snowman, you should have to end it with a snowman</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll look into it</li>
<li>I suspect it's a PGE parsing bug</li>
<li>it gets to the end and finishes without requiring a closing delimiter</li>
<li>looking at the Parrot VM workshop page</li>
<li>three hours is a long introduction to Parrot and PIR</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's easy to adjust</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>an hour for an intro to Parrot is fine</li>
<li>my experience in teaching new languages and systems is that you can go into the history and abstract sense of how it exists</li>
<li>but you end up losing more people than you gain</li>
<li>it's better to get into code quick</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I haven't developed slides yet</li>
<li>threw it out there as a strawman</li>
<li>the people who have slides (slides can I borrow) should speak up</li>
<li>who wants to talk and who can do it?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>will there be names by these talks?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there should be</li>
<li>I can add slots for names</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll do PCT and the Rakudo stuff</li>
<li>unless someone's dying to do it, I can do the PIR stuff</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Allison's done that in the past</li>
<li>I can take it over too</li>
<li>we've changed venue</li>
<li>we'll have two or three classrooms at CMU</li>
<li>not certain what our constraints are there on attendees and room size</li>
<li>we have 48 attendees signed up</li>
<li>Robert's frozen signups until we figure out venue issues</li>
<li>hopefully we'll open that up today</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>three attendees from our Perl 6 group in Dallas are going to YAPC for the Parrot VM Workshop</li>
</ul></p>
