<p><p>You may or may not have noticed that <a href="http://www.onyxneon.com/">Onyx Neon Press</a> launched a site called <a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/">Modern Perl Books</a> last week.  We have some works in progress behind the scenes.</p>

<p>My intent with the site is to gather information on what exactly modern Perl looks like, so that I can write the promised <em>Modern Perl</em> book.  I'm working on the outline and have lots of great ideas, and of course I'll solicit feedback from everyone willing to contribute.</p>

<p>Today I realized the need for a simple definition of "Modern Perl" which a novice programmer could use reliably until he or she is enough of an expert to define a personal subset of the language and its ecosystem.  I know that this'll start all sorts of arguments, but in 21 years no one has done this, so why not try now?</p>

<p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Modern::Perl">Modern::Perl</a> is a CPAN distribution which enables all of the features of Modern Perl in any program which uses it.  Please see <a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/01/toward-a-modernperl.html">Toward a Modern::Perl</a> for more explanation.  I'm sure I'll add more modules, but right now it collapses three lines of code in my simplest programs into one, which is definitely progress in the right direction.</p></p>

The second Catalyst book (out for OSCON in June) will use Moose (with Squirrel acceptable for lightweight Models and Views) as it's only way of doing OO.  I've noticed that Badger has appeared on the perl OO scene, which is great because it show how easy it is to bolt on decent OO into a language as expressive as Perl, but Moose (and it's Squirrel)  has significant and sustained first mover advantage in this situation.

<p>Which version of Perl are you running where <code>use 5.10.0;</code> also enables strictures and warnings?  (It's certainly not the <em>released</em> version of 5.10, nor the packaged version in Ubuntu, nor bleadperl.)</p>

<blockquote><div><p> <em>Please. Don't insult your readers.</em></p></div> </blockquote><p>Please don't quote me out of context.  It's rude, and it leads you into strawman arguments which waste everyone's time.</p><p>Do you remember being a novice programmer?  Have you seen how they get treated in forums such as PerlMonks?  If they haven't included <code>use strict; use warnings;</code> in their code, someone will invariable respond "I don't know how to solve your problem, but you should always <code>use strict; use warnings;</code>."</p><p>Tell me -- how many novices understand what those do and why and how?  For all the Perl hackers who rail against cargo-cult coding, there's sure a lot of cargo-cult recommending going on.  By my estimation, you have to know about modules, pragmas, and importing before <code>strict</code> and <code>warnings</code> make any sense.</p><p>It's funny that you bring up Java, though I have no idea what your point is.  I've compared "Hello, world!" in Perl to Java recently.  If you want to see magic gobbledygook in another language, ask a Java neophyte to explain <code>public</code> or <code>static</code> or <code>class Main</code> or <code>System.out.</code> sometime.</p><p>At least with Perl we have the chance to abstract away some of that boilerplate so novices can't see it -- hence my confusion about what you mean about "Perl-as-Java".</p>

<p>Given that what you wrote appears directly above my reply, I'm not sure how I'm "quoting you out of context."  You're welcome to explain.</p><p>We're in violent agreement about the standard Perlmonks treatment -- chanting "use strict use warnings" at people in replies and sample code is unhelpful, and I've tried to make that point there in the past.  Few novice programmers understand what strict and warnings do, but part of the process of becoming a non-novice is understanding these things.  Simply adding boilerplate to the top of your scripts doesn't help.</p><p>As for my statement about Java, you're probably just being disingenuous, but my point is that Java is a language designed entirely to limit the amount of damage that can be done by idiots.  Companies want to have clueless (therefore cheaper) people produce software, and Java is the answer.  Feature-wise, it's C++ for dummies.</p><p>I don't think Perl should become "Perl for dummies."  Perl is appealing because it is focused on getting the job done, and because it assumes you know what you are doing.  It has never been a language for purists and pedants, and it saddens me to see it becoming one.</p>

All of the power of Perl is still available.

I refuse to believe that trying to make the compiler help people find the bugs they will right turns Perl into a language only suitable for snobs and fools.</p><p>On the other hand, if me releasing this silly little module that's completely optional even to install chases away arrogant pseudo-macho jerks who love to heap scorn on novices and think that artificial difficulties make them Real Men, maybe it's a good thing.</p>

<p>use.perl is even more of a bucket of FAIL than I thought -- "plain old text" sure ain't.  Here's the bit I meant to include in angle quotes:  "You can say "Just copy this around and don't change it and don't worry that you don't understand it," or try to explain it or make it unnecessary. I prefer the latter option."</p>

To be honest, that would read "changing" and "changes," not "fixing" and "improvements."  You want Perl to be one thing, while the P5P regulars want it to be something else.  And the module would be "Chromatic's::Perl" (apologies twice over...;-), not "Modern::Perl."</p><blockquote><div><p>No, but I can offer you an apology for that snideness.</p></div></blockquote><p>
No problem -- these internets make douches of us all.</p>
