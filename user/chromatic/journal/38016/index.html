<p><p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Ovid/journal/38010">Perl 5 is dying</a>, <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/andy.sh/journal/38005">perl.org sites are ugly</a>, and apparently there's a marketing problem somewhere around here.</p>

<p>So what?</p>

<p>I don't mean "Who cares?"  I mean "What are <em>you</em> going to do about it?"</p>

<p>By "you" I don't mean Curtis, or Jarkko, or Andy, or Schwern, or mst, or Ask, or Adam, or Dave, or Chris, or Elliot, or Bill, or Richard, or any of the other several dozen usual suspects who've done far more than any reasonable person have a right to expect.  I mean the "you" who reads this and sagely nods your head while thinking "Somebody should do something!"  You're somebody.  You can do something.</p>

<p>(I'm very happy to run "Something cool I did with Perl!" on Perl.com, so if you've done something cool in a hundred or so lines of Perl -- especially if you can tie it to cloud computing, or inventing the future, or helping people do amazing things -- let me know.  I can sweeten the deal by offering free books to contributors.)</p></p>

<p>What's kinda cool about use.perl is I think most of the design and layout is done with css, so playing with it, would be easy, without having to bother pudge to get it applied. There may be a, "How to Style Slash" guide somewhere - I do remember there was that, "Design Slashdot" competition a few years back that we could cherry-pick ideas from.</p><p>If there's no style guide, it may be another way to contribute to slash, although, if the only sites using it are Slashdot and use.perl, it may be irrelevant. Something does tell me there's some head-into-wall bashing instances of css code, though. One would assume<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your offer, it's highly appreciated.</p><p>As a contributor to Rakudo (Perl 6 on Parrot) I'd like to have a nice logo for it (one that can be used as an executable icon on windows, and on official websites).</p><p>If you'd like to contribute to that, we should get in contact regarding ideas, background and other stuff.<br>Just send a mail either to me (moritz@faui2k3.org) or to the mailing list (perl6-compiler@perl.org) and we'll can get together somehow.</p><p>(And yes, I agree with tron that a few websites need also a redesign, though I think that www.perl.org is more important in that respect.

<p>Given that we have a rather unique marketing chance with Rakudo I must agree that having nice artwork for it is really important.</p><p>On the other hand I don't agree with www.perl.org being more important (because I use it mostly as a stopover).<br>I consider PerlMonks next to use.perl.org as most important.</p>

<h2>Re: first impressions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Denny/">Denny</a> on 2008-12-04T12:39:21</h3>
In that case what we also have is a problem whereby neither www.perl.org nor www.perl.com is a particularly good jump-off point for people new to the Perl community.  As those are the two domains they're most likely to visit as their first online step into the world of Perl, that seems like something we should think about.

<p>Remember, our main problem re: 'perl is dead' is not what you or I think of the designs of these sites, nor the designs of the sites we use the most.  It's what the people new to the idea of using Perl think of the sites they go to first.</p>

Thanks for offering your help.
<p>
The <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/" title="perlide.org">Padre Perl IDE</a perlide.org> needs both an icon for the project to be displayed on web and on the windows, linux and Mac executables.
</p><p>
It also needs some improvement to its standard Trac gui, maybe even using the currently almost empty <a href="http://www.perlide.org/" title="perlide.org">Perl IDE</a perlide.org> web site.

If you can still take such project I'd be glad if you contacted us via IRC on #padre or on the padre-dev mailing list found on our web site.</p>

<h2>Okay, I'll bite . . .</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jeremiah/">jeremiah</a> on 2008-12-04T13:16:18</h3>

I have written yaalr in perl. Mainly because of perl's exceptional text handling capabilities. Yaalr is a simple log reader that reads web logs, has only core dependencies, is GPL, and actively maintained. Available from SourceForge it is in the top ten percent of active projects, (keep in mind SF has &gt; 150,000 projects.)<br/><br/>I think that is kinda cool - do I get a book?<br/><br/>Jeremiah



<h2>But wait! There's more!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jeremiah/">jeremiah</a> on 2008-12-04T13:33:38</h3>
I also work with the debian perl team in debian. Debian uses perl for a variety of tasks under the hood as it were. And many tools, like aptitude for example, began their life as perl programs and later migrated to C++ or C for speed. But there are still tons of perl programs used by debian, some that maybe should make their way to CPAN. Take a look at our Package Entropy Tracker (PET) for example; <a href="http://pkg-perl.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/pet.cgi" title="debian.org">http://pkg-perl.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/pet.cgi</a debian.org><br/><br/>This is a very valuable tool written by tincho in co-ordination with other members of the debian-perl team and has been adopted by other teams inside debian.<br/><br/>The debian perl team gets along nicely, maintains about 1000 perl modules in debian, collaborates with core perl developers, and in general serves as a 'canonical' distribution of perl programs.<br/><br/>All of this work is done by volunteers who are self-selecting and self-organized - for no money!<br/><br/>Surely that is worth a book!?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:^)<br/><br/>Jeremiah

It isn't all roses and I don't pretend otherwise.</p><p>In addition to enriching and perpetuating the community, I also support the developement and advances of the language to keep it relavent</p><p>I have contributed a patch to perl 5 (albeit a short doc fix)</p><p>I have filed bug reports</p><p>I fill out surveys when people ask for input on improving things</p><p>I have contributed code to both Parrot and Pugs</p><p>I have asked questions on the Perl 6 mailing list</p><p>I have built and tested Parrot on platforms such as Win32/Cygwin and Win32/MinGW which seem to be step children but are important to someone</p><p>I have publicly and privately provided funding to developers to work on the future of perl</p><p>I am not sure what else I would have time to be doing.  If you, or anyone else, has an idea of what I could better spend my time on to help I am all ears.  I could certainly write articles for perl.com but it would come at the cost of not spending time on PerlMonks or on IRC - I am tapped out of time so changing WHAT I do with that time is the only offer I can make.</p>

<p>And here we have an example of the stellar responsiveness we've come to expect.</p><p>I don't know why the default changed last August, but it did.  Your assumption that I was not logged in is bad, because I was on a page that was logged in, said my name and all, clicked a link and was logged out.  Or, as happened to me 5 minutes ago, I clicked on a link in my email and landed at a logged out page when I had done the same an hour earlier and saw a logged in page.  I have experienced this with Firefox 2 and no extensions.    I experienced it at home, which is on cable and the IP address could theoretically change but almost certainly doesn't.  I have experienced it at work where my IP <b>definitely</b> doesn't change.  I do not experience anything like this at any other sites.
