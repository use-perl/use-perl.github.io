<p><blockquote><em>Something you may not know about chromatic is that he's a Perl 6 core developer. It's something to consider when reading his (now several) opinion pieces on Ruby, Rails and/or its users.</em></blockquote>

<p>&mdash; <a href="http://djberg96.livejournal.com/">Daniel Berger</a>, <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/06/dsl-or-not#view_7751">comment on "What's a Ruby DSL and what isn't?"</a></p>

<p>I'm also the guy who argued within O'Reilly for publishing more Ruby books in 2003 and 2004, the editor who took a chance and published Curt Hibbs's seminal tutorial on Rails in January 2005, and someone who watched technology features, trends, and people very carefully as part of my job -- a profession I've been in full-time since 2002.</p>

<p>I don't particularly care if people use Ruby.  It's a decent language.  I use it myself sometimes.</p>

<p>I don't particularly care if people use Rails.  It's a decent framework.  I've used it myself a few times.  I don't use it anymore, but those reasons are technical, largely immaterial, and highly uninteresting even to me.</p>

<p>I care when people publish untruths.  I care when people lie about technical matters.  I care when people are so busy giving themselves very vigorous self-handshakes in public that the poison an entire conversation about important issues such as design considerations, software maintainability, and language features.</p>

<p>Maybe this is a hobby horse I shouldn't ride.  Maybe I'm not the guy to say "Uh, there's no substance to the code your emperor just wrote."  If there's really something to internal DSLs -- if there's really some special magic in Ruby that makes it more possible to write them than in any other language -- I'd like to know.  So far, I haven't seen it, and thus I conclude that writing so-called internal DSLs is to Ruby what golf is to Perl -- a stupid fad with a tiny core of interesting truth that gets buried in the silly cooler-than-thou-and-especially-thy-non-Ruby-language posing that passes for conversation in <em>certain parts</em> of the Ruby community these days.</p>

<p>I emphasized the phrase <em>certain parts</em> because some of the smartest, most capable, most humble, and most pleasant people I know consider themselves part of the Ruby community.  This includes Chad Fowler, David Black, Dave Thomas, Piers Cawley, and Charles Nutter.  That's an extremely non-exhaustive list, by the way.</p>

<p>Yet when Chad Fowler said from the stage that Rubyists have a reputation for being "arrogant bastards", RailsConf 2007 laughed and applauded.  I know that none of the people I mentioned in the previous paragraph were amused.</p>

<p>If the fact that I'm a Parrot committer and that I'm on the Perl 6 design team means that no one should listen to my opinions, I think you may have missed the point.  You shouldn't listen to my opinions because I'm occasionally bitter, often subtle, usually over the top, and always trying foremost to entertain myself.</p>

<p>That doesn't, in itself, make my opinions wrong.  Only facts could do that.</p></p>

<h2>ruby has become a religion</h2>

I am no ruby expert, but I have noticed that some people do get religious about it and as any religion does, it attracts fanatics and bigots.<br/><br/>"arrogant bastards" is quite an understatement.

<p>If you haven&#8217;t noticed that the entirety of the software industry is a fashion industry, only worse, you haven&#8217;t been around for long enough.</p>

<p>Combine that with the weblog echo chamber, and you really have something.</p>

<h2>DSLs</h2>

DSLs are so last week, everyone knows that Monoids are the way of the future.

<p>You mean monads? They differ from DSLs in one small point&#8230; you can actually <em>define what a monad is</em>. (What a concept.)</p>
