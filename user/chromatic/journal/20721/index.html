<div class="span8">
<p><p>Like <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/brian_d_foy/"><code>brian d foy</code></a>, I have a lot of little command-line tools to make my life easier.  Today, I wrote two more.</p>

<p>One of the parts of Mac OS X I actually miss (and there are a few) is its <code>open</code> command that examines a named file and attempts to open it in an appropriate application.  That's an easy program to write, if you aim for 80% effectiveness, but it's so convenient that when I found myself wishing for it today, I spent five minutes writing it.</p>

<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

use File::MMagic;

my $file     = shift or die "Usage: $0 <filename>\n";

my %subtypes = map { $_ => 1 } 'application/x-zip', 'text/plain', 'text/html';
my %apps     =
(
	'application/star-office'  => 'xooffice',
	'application/msword'       => 'abiword-2.0',
	'application/mozilla'      => 'moz_tab',
	'image/jpeg'               => 'eog',
	'image/gif'                => 'eog',
	'text/html'                => 'moz_tab',
);
my %exts     = 
(
	'application/star-office', => qr/\.sxw\Z/, 
	'application/mozilla',     => qr/\.html?\Z/i, 
);

my $mm       = File::MMagic->new();

while (my ($subtype, $regex) = each %exts)
{
	$mm->addFileExts( $regex, $subtype );
}

my $type     = $mm->checktype_filename(   $file );
$type        = $mm->checktype_byfilename( $file ) if exists $subtypes{ $type };

die "Unknown type '$type'\n" unless exists $apps{ $type };

fork and exit;
exec $apps{$type}, $file, @ARGV;</pre>

<p>It's worth factoring out the file types, applications, and subtypes into data somewhere, but when I find myself needing to maintain a bigger list, I'll do that.</p>

<p>You might notice a program called <code>moz_tab</code>.  What does that do?  I usually have Mozilla running with several tabs on a different virtual desktop.  (Now you begin to see what I missed from a real window manager when I used Mac OS X!)  I do want to open HTML files in Mozilla, but I don't want to open them in a new browser window or, worse, with a different profile.  <code>moz_tab</code> checks to see if there's an existing window and opens a new tab or a window as appropriate.</p>

<pre>#!/bin/sh

# create an absolute path
DIR=`pwd`
FILE="$DIR/$1"

# check if Mozilla is already running
/usr/bin/mozilla -remote 'ping()'
STATUS=$?

# launch a new tab, if so
if [ "$STATUS" == 0 ]; then
	exec /usr/bin/mozilla -remote "openurl(file://$FILE,new-tab)"
fi

# or launch a new window
exec /usr/bin/mozilla "file://$FILE"</pre>

<p>It doesn't check for an absolute path before absolutifying the path, but if I need that, I'll add another line.</p>

<p>Having both of these programs available has saved me almost a minute today.  That doesn't seem like much, but keep in mind that I'd have spent that minute navigating developer-hostile file chooser windows.  If I can avoid that by using the developer-friendly command line in a ubiquitous terminal window, my life is much more pleasant.</p></p>

<h2>Which OSX?</h2>

<i>One of the parts of Mac OS X I actually miss (and there are a few) is its open command that examines a named file and attempts to open it in an appropriate application.</i> <br> <br>I'm not sure which version you are running, but Panther definitely has an open command.<blockquote><div> <tt>tibook:~ phillip$ which open<br>/usr/bin/open<br>tibook:~ phillip$ ls<br>Desktop&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Movies&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Public&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; buddyretriever&nbsp; mysql.dump<br>Documents&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Music&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sites&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;dns.txt<br>Library&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pictures&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; benchmarks&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mbox&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; test.pl<br>tibook:~ phillip$ open dns.txt</tt> </div></blockquote>And... up pops textedit with the file loaded. (Which reminds me that I haven't associated BBEdit with<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.txt files.)<br> <br>This is especially handy when you give it a hidden directory as an argument... It will open the directory in the finder for you.

<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2004-09-04T17:23:26</h3>
<p>It was a misleading sentence.</p>

<p>I don't use Mac OS X anymore.  The <code>open</code> command is one of the few features of Mac OS X that I didn't have under Linux -- and I missed it.</p>

<h2>Factoring out the file types and applications</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2004-09-05T01:32:31</h3>
<p>There's already a place for them: <tt>~/.mailcap</tt> (MIME type to app map) and <tt>~/.mime.types</tt> (extension to MIME type map), as well as non-dot versions in<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>/etc</tt>. Parsers should exist on CPAN.</p>

<p>I've toyed with the idea you're presenting here many times, but never actually bothered to do something about that itch.</p>

<p>I did write a dirty tool called <tt>rat</tt> though, which does a subset of what <tt>open</tt> might, for tarballs (it also gained support for zips and rars). The name is because <tt>tar</tt> is backwards&hellip;<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt> It just barely works well enough to be sufficient for 99.9% of cases, which doesn't motivate me to fix it, which means it remains so stupid I don't want to publish it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt> Ah, programmers&hellip;</p>



<h2>rox filer</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/phlaegel/">phlaegel</a> on 2004-09-05T07:05:58</h3>
I use rox filer this way occasionally. I have rox all set up with app-&gt;file mappings, and then just run 'rox somefile.blah' to get the right app.



<h2>URI::ImpliedBase</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pemungkah/">pemungkah</a> on 2004-09-05T15:40:15</h3>
... wil handle those file://../../etc URIs for you.



<h2>Can also use &quot;gnome-open&quot; or similar...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sharumpe/">sharumpe</a> on 2007-08-17T17:27:04</h3>
<p>Just in case other folks find this the way I did...</p>

<p>Another work-alike of the Mac OS X "open" command is "gnome-open", which is newer than chromatic's post, I think.  I can't find any documentation that looks official, but there is a decent write-up <a href="http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2006/12/16/gnome-open-open-anything-from-the-command-line/" title="wordpress.com">here</a wordpress.com> </p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
