<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 10 February 2010.  Larry, Patrick, Will, Jerry, and chromatic attended.<p>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>working on simplifying Parrot's build process</li>
<li>trying to remove an invocation of Perl 5 for every compilation</li>
<li>it's old and a waste of many things</li>
<li>hope to have that removed by the end of the week</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the new #ps time should help me to attend</li>
<li>looking forward to a Parrot/Rakudo workshop, possibly at YAPC::NA</li>
<li>already working on artwork</li>
<li>would like to get the command-line done for Rakudo *</li>
<li>lacking tuits</li>
<li>need some time with Patrick over the next few days</li>
<li>weekends should free up after next week</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>refined the specified semantics of bitwise operators</li>
<li>changed ugly <code>**()</code> special form to <code>prefix:&lt;||&gt;</code> by analogy to <code>prefix:&lt;|&gt;</code>, and relationship of <code>**</code> to <code>*</code>.</li>
<li>STD now accepts prefix <code>||</code> for slice interpolation</li>
<li>deleted old p5=&gt; that masak++ noticed</li>
<li>added explicit copyright notices to STD files</li>
<li>spruced up error message on -> in postfix position (either pointy block or Perl 5 method dereference)</li>
<li>mostly just served as Chief Resident Oracle on IRC</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>had a nice vacation in Florida</li>
<li>didn't have as much hacking time, due to plane delays</li>
<li>should get back to coding later today</li>
<li>working on the Rakudo hackathon in Copenhagen on March 6 and 7</li>
<li>core hackers session on 8th and 9th there</li>
<li>looking forward to that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>fixed a couple of bugs</li>
<li>did a bit of optimization</li>
<li>wrote out a GC optimization plan</li>
<li>wrote plan for a sweep free GC</li>
<li>think we can get those both going in the next week</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>noticing a lot of new branches and removals and new things in Parrot recently</li>
<li>are these following the roadmap?</li>
<li>are people going off on their own?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the deprecation stuff is all documented and seems reasonable</li>
<li>Andrew's discussion today is new stuff, but a reasonable discussion to have</li>
<li>I'm working on cleanup stuff</li>
<li>having a roadmap and trying to force people to stick to it is always... impossible</li>
<li>people will work on what they find shiny or what blocks them</li>
<li>if it's not on the roadmap, it's okay if it's not hurting the project</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we've changed our deprecation cycle</li>
<li>was that change enough to unstick people to do something?</li>
<li>was it beneficial to our users and our core developers?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>definitely a positive</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>still not a lot of mailing list discussion</li>
<li>how is Parrot meeting Rakudo's goals for the Rakudo * release?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>as it stands today, it's adequate for what we need</li>
<li>if it weren't, you'd be hearing about it</li>
<li>the next thing for us is performance</li>
<li>any performance improvements are welcome</li>
<li>the biggest thing there is GC, and that's an area of focus</li>
<li>no big pushes I need to make lately</li>
<li>have noticed Andrew's desire to remove some Parrot features</li>
<li>they're useful from an HLL perspective</li>
<li>I do worry about changes to core Parrot divorced from HLL concerns</li>
<li>I don't know who's going to be the traffic cop for those changes</li>
<li>I don't have time to do it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>based on the discussion in channel today</li>
<li>making Parrot leaner, faster, smaller may not necessarily jive with keeping the features as they exist now</li>
<li>he's not trying to remove features</li>
<li>he's trying to get the same effect with a faster Parrot</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I agree with those motives</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>even if we do rewrite things, they have to work more or less as they do right now</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>reviewing the roadmap from December....</li>
<li>GC work is happening</li>
<li>no one seems to work on subroutine leave semantics</li>
<li>Stephen Weeks is the best one to look at that</li>
<li>performance is our biggest need right now</li>
<li>but the -ng branch performs better for various reasons</li>
<li>has anyone built -ng against the latest Parrot?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I think Vasily has checked his branches against Rakudo</li>
<li>not sure if that was against -ng</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>master and -ng are pretty close together in terms of the Parrot core</li>
<li>we'll make -ng the master branch very soon</li>
<li>unless I get bogged down on iterators again</li>
</ul></p>
