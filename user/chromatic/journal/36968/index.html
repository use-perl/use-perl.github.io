<h2>Ruby != Rails</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2008-07-21T14:45:40</h3>
Here's my list of reasons why:
<ul>
<li>Refusal by the ruby-core team to implement a real test suite.</li>
<li>Refusal by the ruby-core team to implement continuous integration.</li>
<li>Refusal by the ruby-core team to ever go back and refactor any of the core C files.</li>
<li>Continued use of pre-ANSI C. It's 2008.</li>
<li>Refusal by the ruby-core team to compile with any warnings on, ever.</li>
<li>Terrible release management by the core team. Community built spec suite failures ignored.</li> <li>Addition of questional libraries into the stdlib.</li>
<li>Cowtowing to the Rails community.</li>
<li>Shoehorning 1.9 features into the 1.8 branch making the spec even more difficult to cover, and creating a serious crisis for alternative implementations.</li></ul>

<p>I agree with your entire post, including the subject.  I don't believe that people outside the Ruby community who have a negative perception of Ruby hold those reasons though.  For all of the technical problems of Ruby (and the only one on my list and not yours is questionable but fixable implementation decisions), perception is primarily a social problem.</p><p>(For similar Perl problems, see comp.lang.perl.misc and Perl golf.)</p>

<h2>RubyFringe especially != Rails</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lamech/">lamech</a> on 2008-07-21T19:11:27</h3>
I was at RubyFringe, and it felt a lot like YAPC; small, intimate, a chance to hang out and meet like-minded folks, and a chance to learn about a lot of very cool bleeding edge ruby stuff that *isn't* Rails, from the people who're actually making it happen. Pete was quite explicit about his mission being the improvement of the ruby community as a whole. While I agree that of course you reap what you sow, the emergence of a grassroots movement within the ruby community can only be a good thing. It sounds to me like you're taking Pete's rhetorical question -- meant to challenge his fellow rubyists to some (possibly long-overdue) soul-searching -- and using it to bash the guys who're trying to make positive change from within for the sins and omissions of the community they're trying to improve. Is that useful?

<blockquote><div><p> <em>It sounds to me like you're taking Pete's rhetorical question...</em></p></div> </blockquote><p>Are there any rhetorical questions on the Internet?</p><p>Maybe I'm really not someone who should talk about perceptions of technical communities.  (I spend a lot of time on my employer's payroll watching and thinking about them.)  Still, I find the Ruby world fascinating in a way that I don't find the Perl world, probably because I'm responsible for approximately none of the direction and development of the Ruby world.  It's similar enough that I (believe I can) recognize patterns and behaviors, but different enough that I (believe I have) an interesting and useful perspective.</p><blockquote><div><p> <em>Is that useful?</em></p></div> </blockquote><p>That depends on the rhetoricalness of the question and whether my answer has any veracity.  I can only answer the question for myself.</p>
