<p><blockquote><p><em>IÃ¢â¬â¢m baffled at what the PerlMonks developers and admins were thinking storing their passwords in plain-text....  This is something that not only has been in Perl since version 1.0, but has also been integrated natively in almost every database environment on the planet.</em></p>

<p><em>IÃ¢â¬â¢m ashamed as a Perl developer, and this gives a huge black eye to the entire Perl community.</em></p>

<p>Storing passwords in plain text is wrong, full stop, but if I'd had a server rooted, I'd worry about more than just bad guys reading database dumps.  A little phishing code would be easy to insert into a lot of web sites.</p>

<p>Then again, I also worry about DNS hijacking.</p>

<p>If I had a gripping hand, I'd tell you that I once saw a neighbor store a spare house key under the mailbox, and that's why I'm seriously considering switching to a condo for my next dwelling.  Guy gave all homeowners everywhere a black eye, even though pockets have been in clothing since almost Textiles version 1.0, not to mention integrated natively in almost every pair of jeans on the planet.</p></p>

<p>"After this, I&#8217;m seriously considering switching to another language for my next project."</p><p>Huh.  I guess that is like seeing someone fall down a flight of stairs, and deciding to avoid stairs from then on.</p>

<h2>to what language</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2009-07-31T13:06:53</h3>
<tt>Hmm, going to switch from perl, eh?&nbsp; Perhaps going to a language that does not have a built-in crypt function will give you better security.</tt>
