<p><p>I just skimmed <a href="http://www.herongyang.com/perl/">Herong's Tutorial Notes on Perl - Part A</a>, and it could really use some editorial review.  I'm sure there are dozens of other tutorials in the wild that suggest some less than savory practices.  Is it worth finding people to make suggestions?  (I don't have time.)</p></p>

When I see stuff that is clearly written in 1995 in Perl4-style (cgi-lib.pl, anyone?), it scares me a bit, especially to realize that it has survived over a decade without being corrected or even refreshed a bit.  When I can, I try to find some contact address, but a lot of these websites are on autopilot, or perhaps some new guy has inherited some old content and doesn't know where to begin.  {sigh}

I tried leaving a comment with about 12 corrections that I saw immediately on that guy's website, but it's impossible: not only does his comment system have broken whitespace &lt; &gt; handling, it also filters out everything containing URLs and @.

There are too many out there, and the ones that might reply don't really care if the information is correct. Some of them even think they are hard core hackers so they must be right. After all, they think that they can write a tutorial after using Perl for a week.<br><br>I'd rather that you keep working on parrot and leave the flood of ignorant information out there as it is and as it will stay despite your efforts.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>

<p><div class="quote">I'd rather that you keep working on parrot and leave the flood of ignorant information out there as it is and as it will stay despite your efforts.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</div>  <p>I'll second that.</p>

<p>It is quite sad though.  If someone <i>does</i> want to do something about it, "hall of fame" and "hall of shame" pages on the <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/" title="perlfoundation.org">Perl 5 Wiki</a perlfoundation.org> might be a good starting point.</p>

<p>Lo!  There already is a <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?recommended_online_tutorials" title="perlfoundation.org">recommended tutorials</a perlfoundation.org> page.  Now, to just get that linked from learn.perl.org.</p>

Hall of shame page on the wiki for books, articles, tutorials and debunked myths would be good together with debunkings, corrections, etc.
