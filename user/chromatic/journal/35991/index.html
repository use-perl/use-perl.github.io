I think you're reading too much into it. He's just saying that it got too complex and needed to prune back the complexity to get it finished.<br><br>Now maybe perl6 needed to do that a long time ago, though it's a bit late for that. But I don't think the comparison was warrantless.

<p>I have difficulty with conversations about software project schedules and scope which include comparisons to Perl 6 but neglect to mention the budget of Perl 6.  That's all.  If the ES4 committee spent on ES4 what Perl 6 has cost in real dollars so far, ES4 would be a great language for writing <code>alert( "Hello, world!" );</code>.  They might even have money left over for doughnuts.</p>

<p>The "contribute money" page at donate.perlfoundation.org does not allow you to explicitly specify "I want my donation to go towards Perl 6 development".</p>

<p>Seems like it would be nice if there was an easy and centralized way for money contributors to pump cash directly into specific tasks needing to be done for Perl 6... Not sure how fair this would work out in practice though.</p>

Ever since P6 was a project and a divisive one at that, I asked that such a restricted giving mechanism be put in place so that people could direct their donations to the projects they were interested in. I'm still waiting. It'll likely happen about the same time P6 is released.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Well, it's a lot more complicated than a 'combo box', you need a good accountant and the ability to be accountable to the donors.

Calendar is all I can really compare. If someone of greater knowledge than I wants to list out the people paid full time to develop perl 1-5 then they can. If not I'm happy enough to keep on assuming 1-5 is compatible to 6 in this respect but produced a final product.

<p>Schedules for projects with full-time paid workers are difficult enough to create.  Any schedule for a project which relies chiefly on volunteers working in their spare time is going to be, at best, a fairy tale.  Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying.</p>

Sorry, instead of "schedule" I should have said "roadmap."  All it takes to have a roadmap is one leader willing to make plans, and if the plans are good enough, people will volunteer.  Perl 6 (well, Parrot mostly) just wanders in circles.  How many half-baked intermediate languages and half-done Scheme interpreters does the world need?

<p>Rakudo and Parrot both have roadmaps with defined milestones.  See the <a href="http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/languages/perl6/ROADMAP" title="perl.org">Rakudo roadmap</a perl.org> and <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/parrot/index.cgi?release_planning" title="perlfoundation.org">Parrot release planning</a perlfoundation.org>.</p> <p><blockquote><div><nobr> <wbr></nobr><em>...if the plans are good enough, people will volunteer.</em></div> </blockquote>

<p>That never happened for Perl 5.    p5p's lucky if people even download release candidates.  Why would you believe that Perl 6 or Parrot will be any different?</p>

<h2>Re:how about perl 1-5</h2>

Skepticism about a roadmap for a project that's been wandering in circles for 6 years seems reasonable.  (And are there specs for those things on the Parrot roadmap?  Are those specs subject to random editing after one starts implementing them?)

<p>As for Perl 5... First, there's a big difference excitement-wise between "be our tester" and "write this code."  There's a reason I don't apply for testing jobs.  Second, Perl 5 just released something I can use, no?</p>

<p><blockquote> <div><em>Skepticism about a roadmap for a project that's been wandering in circles for 6 years seems reasonable.</em></div> </blockquote>

<p>We've been <em>hitting</em> those milestones for a year now.  We don't do any work in secret.  It's all public.  Everyone can see our successes and failures if they only care to look.  Our weekly Parrot status meetings have been open to the public for years and we've published the minutes of those for years.  I've personally published the minutes of the weekly Perl 6 design meetings for months, if not years.</p>

<p>If you have concrete, specific suggestions to make all of this information clearer and more available, please don't hesitate to bring it up in the #parrot or #perl6 IRC channels or on one of the mailing lists.  The answers to your parenthetical questions are likewise available.  (I even edited the Wikipedia entry for Parrot over a year ago to answer them.)</p> <p><blockquote> <div><em>As for Perl 5...</em></div> </blockquote>

<p>... volunteers don't magically appear no matter how much pixie dust you sprinkle around the world's best plan.  The Parrot website has a list of dozens of available tasks for volunteers, and those tasks include both estimates of the time and work necessary as well as the skills needed.  We've had that list likewise for years, and I'm about to start doing those tasks myself because they're not getting done and we need to get them done.</p>

Well, only after you teach the Masters course in Why we should give a fuck if you all are getting a salary on the same level as another project with lots of commercial application and backers.
<p>
It reminds me of the guy who did the original "Fools Errand" crypto game for the Mac. He announced he was working on the sequel for OSX and invited people to pay early (Damn you, pudge<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)) Now, this was around the time Perl6 was announced. Six years ago I would have loved to have that game for hours and hours of enjoyment but every 6 months or so he sends out some excuse about not getting the game done and declares it will be done soon. Well, you know, after a while you get used to the idea that you aren't ever going to see it and it was $35 poorly spent but it'll be a nice curiosity if it ever does materialise. I don't think people are sending him monthly donations to keep him going.</p>

<p>Until sixty seconds ago, I thought that anyone who had spent any time at all around Jarkko, for example, would <em>know</em> the connection between the available free time of volunteers and the amount of practical work accomplished on a project.</p>

<p>You don't have to care about any project, of course, but you don't have the right to tell volunteers what they should or shouldn't be working on or how much time they should or shouldn't spend on a project.</p>

<h2>Re:Welcome Back, Elaine!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2008-03-28T18:26:39</h3>
What, project management has become an exercise in whining about not getting paid? Jarkko had a day job and he spent all of his time outside of that day job on Perl. I'm not sure had someone been offering money that they could have afforded him. If anyone has less pity than me for the lot of you working for nothing I'd like to meet them.
<p>
Do or don't but getting all bent out of shape over someone making a comment that may lead to Perl6 being a synonym for an eternal project isn't a way to generate sympathy or cash donations.</p>

<p>I can imagine you expressing strong words toward anyone who criticized the release schedule of Perl 5.8 for similar reasons.  Lest you think I'm begging for money, let me be exceedingly clear about my point.</p>

<p>See Spot.  See Spot program.  See Spot program four hours a week in his spare time.</p>

<p>See Jane.  See Jane program.  See Jane program forty hours a week in her job.</p>

<p>See Jane accomplish roughly an order of magnitude more work than Spot.  <strong>Whack!</strong>  Bad Spot.  No biscuit.</p>

I believe the thanks Jarkko got when he released 5.8 was a lot of grumbling about 'core bloat'. Although one person did send along a bottle of single malt. There were plenty of critics all along the way and his magnanimous public face was not always so at home. I would have intervened if he had decided to continue past 5 years of  sadomaschochistic behaviour such as being the pumpkin is. I doubt 5.8 would have been released any sooner had he been on the payroll. I am similarly skeptical for P6.

Jane ain't gonna get a regular paycheck for P6 so Jane better cheer up and get on with it or find a more rewarding hobby...like getting root canals.</p>

Paid programmers generally dont' and won't work on predictable schedules.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<p>
I don't know that people complain so much about the long dev time for P6 anymore, they talk about it and many don't have any expectations that it will ever come to pass. Lowering expectations is less a criticism than bracing for reality. And after so many years, really, wouldn't you be prepared for that eventuality? 5.10 had some problems for a while in this vein, but fires got lit under asses and things got moving again. If 5.10 was still at 5.9X wouldn't you be thinking that it was a bit excessively long to wait?

I would suggest installing the meetime plugin for firefox and/or a greasemonkey script to filter out all the discussions about perl 6 not being here yet, and instead updating the page I started but haven't been able to update on the perl 6 wiki that goes some way to answering the 'are we there yet' question : <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?what_can_i_do_with_perl_6_today" title="perlfoundation.org">http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?what_can_i_do_with_perl_6_today</a perlfoundation.org><br><br>This has 2 benefits<br>- one discussing perl 6 on internet discussion forums isn't going to make you happier (how often is the result positive vs a waste of time) and usually there *will* be somebody else who will defend perl 6 if you get on with something else instead, 999/1000 times they can just copy one of your earlier answers.<br>- two I think that page could both boost morale and keep people like me who don't have much time a  quick way to see what they could do in a way that is easier for somebody external to the project to follow than milestones.<br><br>Anyway - thanks for the hard work<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
