<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 05 December 2007.  Larry, Allison,
Patrick, Jerry, Nicholas, Jesse, Richard, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>still working on the events implementation</li>
<li>a few days past the deadline</li>
<li>I have the event loop working, but I'm just cleaning up some backend stuff</li>
<li>improved the scheduler runloop just this morning</li>
<li>having a blast</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Richard:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>what is included?  Signal handling?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>yes</li>
<li>also user-generated events</li>
<li>can be keypresses, any event you want, messages from async IO</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>timers, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it was the December 1 milestone</li>
<li>I'm also implementing the concurrency PDD to help with the events milestone</li>
<li>that puts us ahead of the concurrency deadline</li>
<li>looks like I won't be doing the release this month</li>
<li>we're going to pull in some new hackers to do some release work</li>
<li>I'll work on the next PDD</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>who are the new people you're dragging in?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>smash is one of them, kjs is on the list</li>
<li>maybe Jim Keenan?</li>
<li>Will's putting out a call for more people</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>things are pretty okay</li>
<li>the English-speaking part of my brain has turned back on</li>
<li>I polished up the State of the Onion and sent that off for Perl.com</li>
<li>I finally wrote the interview for Federico Biancuzzi that's six months overdue</li>
<li>answering a whole bunch of mailing list e-mail I've been putting off for weeks</li>
<li>no actual hacking this week</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Perl 6 on Parrot compiler is now mostly NQP</li>
<li>really really cool</li>
<li>just a strong set of hacking over the past couple of weeks</li>
<li>I'm very happy with the way it works and the way it looks</li>
<li>I think the slowness is the parsing</li>
<li>likely something in the rules engine</li>
<li>Jerry has been hacking on the new version of the compiter quite a bit</li>
<li>he says it's much nicer than it was before, and I agree</li>
<li>I no longer feel like I'm writing code that no one else will be able to read</li>
<li>it's not always obvious, but it's easier to explain than most of the PIR code</li>
<li>more updates to the compiler tools suite</li>
<li>now you can put PIR inline with the Perl 6 functions in NQP</li>
<li>that came out much better than I thought it would have</li>
<li>we can write everything in Perl 6 syntax, except for a few things</li>
<li>with a few PIR instructions, the rest seems to work nicely</li>
<li>dropping in and out of PIR is compatible with Perl 6 syntax</li>
<li>it's really fun</li>
<li>we get to write Perl 6 code, and then we just put in some PIR to make it all better until we can write that part in Perl 6</li>
<li>spent the past couple of days rewriting the coding rules for the parser</li>
<li>interpolation, splitting on space, not splitting on space</li>
<li>that can get a little hairy</li>
<li>I'm pleased with how the code came out</li>
<li>it's understandable, even though it's all PIR</li>
<li>my next step is to help Jerry and others get the compiler passing all of its tests</li>
<li>at least where it was before</li>
<li>primarily working on documentation</li>
<li>that's the big thing people come in and look for</li>
<li>I'll work on docs or Pynie tomorrow on a four-hour plane ride</li>
<li>Pynie's not as primitive as abc or as complex at Perl 6</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>how much of the Perl 6 implementation is filling in small stubs?</li>
<li>is there a large amount of that to do?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we need a few more of the basics in there</li>
<li>they need more intimate knowledge of what's going on behind the scenes</li>
<li>we have the proper Perl 6 object model in place now</li>
<li>we couldn't do that easily before</li>
<li>there will be a lot of those things</li>
<li>adding generic functions and generic methods</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'd really appreciate a tutorial showing adding a medium complexity feature</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'd be happy to write that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll identify one and then we'll put something together</li>
<li>useful and not trivial</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>things are wonderful</li>
<li>I'm having more fun now than I had in all of last year</li>
<li>the setup we have now with PCT and the Perl 6 compiler is a joy to work with</li>
<li>everything falls into place</li>
<li>we're making good progress</li>
<li>I'm looking forward to being able to add more contributors</li>
<li>getting various tests to pass from the sanity tests</li>
<li>the PIR to NQP conversion is still going</li>
<li>I'm working on the <code>for</code> statement now</li>
<li>Patrick and I talked earlier today</li>
<li>I have a good handle now on the structure of PAST</li>
<li>PDD 26 is descriptive</li>
<li>can't think of a single blocker</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm letting Jerry do most of the implementation</li>
<li>just answering questions about it</li>
<li>that gives us someone else who understands it</li>
<li>gives me experience leading others through it</li>
<li>lets me focus on deeper issues</li>
<li>it's working out very well</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I think Perl turns 20 on the 18th of December</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>hope to get the task scheduler algorithm in place in the next couple of days</li>
<li>it's a simple array-based heap</li>
<li>basically a solved problem in OS-based task schedulers</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Richard:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>does it seem worthwhile to find someone who will fund many hackathons?</li>
<li>I talked to Patrick about this a while back</li>
<li>I'd like to ship him around every couple of months to crystallize developer effort in useful directions</li>
<li>if you get one person fanaticized per hackathon, that's good progress</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>is this Perl 6 in specific or TPF?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Richard:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>good question</li>
<li>I've noticed that grassroots hackathons have never had a specific Perl 6 focus</li>
<li>personally I'd prefer to focus on Perl 6</li>
<li>maybe saying that at least half of it will be Perl 6</li>
<li>we'll get Allison on a plane or Patrick</li>
<li>I'd like to at least do that much</li>
<li>we'll still need local organizers with time and effort to make it happen</li>
<li>it'll depend on where they want their volunteer efforts to go</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>might be good to offer the organizers of a workshop or conference money to organize a hackathon</li>
<li>lots of developers, done with talks, existing space</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>if someone can get me somewhere, I'm happy to go and present or organize</li>
<li>part of the Mozilla Foundation grant is to evangelize the project</li>
<li>I've tentatively committed to offer a Perl 6 track at the PPW next October</li>
<li>my biggest problem is conflicts with existing dates</li>
<li>I'll be in Brussels in February for FOSDEM</li>
<li>it's not too late to change my tickets to swing through somewhere else for a hackathon or a mongers group</li>
<li>if anyone hears about that, let me know</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Richard:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we'll find new money to fund your travel and lodging</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>given jet lag and the hate of transatlantic flights, is this a North American thing?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Richard:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we've funded things like the Amsterdam hackathon</li>
<li>I'll happily plan one wherever it makes sense</li>
<li>as for the key people, it might mean their plane ticket is more expensive and they'll arrive more jetlagged</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it looks like Rafael will have one more release candidate for 5.10</li>
<li>kp6 showed a big segfault in a massive hunk of generated code</li>
<li>not sure how to simplify that</li>
<li>is there a Perl 5.10 press release?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Simon Wistow has one just about ready to go</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we had a lot of translations for the one for 5.8</li>
<li>it was nice padding for newspapers and things</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>ask Simon to send that around for translation</li>
<li>commit it to the trunk</li>
<li>somehow get translators without turning p5p into a press release debating service</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>some interest in bug bounties from the London Perl Workshop for the Winter of Code</li>
<li>is that something Perl 6 needs?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>let's see how well the bounties work before complicating it first</li>
<li>no call on Boxing Day</li>
<li>we'll see about the second of January</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Richard:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>about the inlining of PIR into NQP...</li>
<li>how does that work?</li>
<li>doesn't the PIR have to be compatible with what's generated on either side of it?</li>
<li>needs to be aware of its context?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>a little bit</li>
<li>it's not too bad</li>
<li>PIR has intstructions to fetch and store lexical variables</li>
<li>you say that you need <code>$x</code> into PIR, fetch it into a register, then manipulate it</li>
<li>you do need to know the context</li>
<li>but it's easy to do</li>
<li>you can create lexical variables and the remainder of the subroutine can access them</li>
<li>once you see an example or two, you can do it for yourself</li>
<li>you can write an entire subroutine in PIR but let NQP/Perl 6 handle all of the calling conventions</li>
<li>we'll have some examples of that</li>
<li>I'll answer this in more detail in a journal post</li>
