<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 04 October 2006.  Larry, Allison, Nicholas, Patrick, Jesse, and chromatic attended.  These are the minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>getting caught up with work after my Europe trip</li>
<li>attempting to use Perl 6 for some of that</li>
<li>Pugs is not terribly fast at that, so it's not entirely practical</li>
<li>getting some experience with programming Perl 6</li>
<li>it's kinda cool</li>
<li>but in spots I think "who thought up this?"</li>
<li>overall happy with the feel and texture of the language</li>
<li>the mix of identifiers and non-identifiers seems to be pleasing</li>
<li>also helping with the test suite</li>
<li>participating in ongoing design and meta discussions</li></ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>any particularly fun ratholes of late?</li></ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the discussion of what Perl should allow you to do or not seems a little
	  silly</li>
<li>you ought to have the ability to ask Perl to tell you not to do things</li>
<li>by and large, these things have to be culturally determined, not
	  technically</li>
<li>the specs don't actually talk about this yet</li>
<li>probably should be a note saying that it is culturally unacceptable to
	  have stealth policy modules</li>
<li>ought to make a distinction between policy-influencing modules and
	  modules that add features</li>
<li>if the feature being added requires a policy, that's part of the
	  contract and that's fine</li>
<li>but adding riders to an unrelated bill is wrong</li></ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>someone quoted you on a list saying that we need to focus on 6.0 and not
	  on <em>mumble</em> after it</li></ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I don't remember saying that or what I said it in contrast to</li>
<li>might have been on IRC</li>
<li>maybe discussing something with a conservative decision now that let us
	  defer that decision</li>
<li>maybe we should defer those decisions these days, unless there's an easy
	  way to go</li>
<li>sort of the flip side of Allison's moment of Zen moment</li>
<li>just a request for convergence, not immediate freeze</li>
<li>we should all be aiming to converge on something we can get out
	  eventually</li></ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>reviewing proposals this week</li>
<li>doing my bit so other people can get on with their bits</li>
<li>making good progress with Leo and Jonathan Worthington</li>
<li>need to add a couple of things to the IO PDD</li>
<li>my next PDD to write is either events or threads</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>threads will be interesting</li></ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>maybe I'll do events first</li>
<li>not in avoiding the hard work things</li>
<li>but just to get things done</li></ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>maybe worth doing a two-hour pass at threads to add interesting
	  questions</li>
<li>try to get people having heated debates in public to get interesting
	  source material</li></ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I can spend two hours and see if it's then a horrible idea</li></ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Liz M. worked on Perl 6 thread semantics for quite a while</li>
<li>she's learned a lot by doing horrible things with Perl 5 ithreads</li>
<li>Audrey convinced her to do a draft concurrency synopsis for Perl 6</li></ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I actually like that</li>
<li>started talking about concurrency in the IO PDD</li></ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>think that's a better way of talking about it</li>
<li>threads is just one way to do concurrency</li>
<li>I thought that Parrot internals used the ithreads model</li>
<li>separate interpreters</li>
<li>as far as I can tell with STM, you have to create cheap new concurrency</li></ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Chip and I will meet and prioritize this afternoon</li>
<li>hopefully we can do that regularly when I'm in town</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>talking to some projects about embedding Parrot</li>
<li>mostly research now</li>
<li>doing some research into other embedding languages: Lua, Tcl, Ruby,
	  Python</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>look at MzScheme</li>
<li>designed for embedding</li>
<li>don't know if it's worth talking to CLKao about embedding SpiderMonkey</li>
<li>Claes Jacobson did the initial work</li></ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Yves Orton is adding features to the Perl 5 regex engine that come from
	  PCRE</li>
<li>see Mastering Regular Expressions, 3rd ed</li>
<li>proposing to adding more other features</li>
<li>includes named capture groups -- two alternate syntaxes in the wild</li>
<li>it's not clear what the best syntax is to represent the named capture, a
reference to the current named capture (<code>\1</code> versus
<code>$1</code>), and the effective hash lookup on the capture group
(<code>%+</code> perhaps)</li>
<li>it would be really useful to have syntax review</li>
<li>also consideration for Perl 6 and 6 on 5</li></ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>maybe the people putting 6 on 5 should drive this</li></ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>also with regard to the semantics of Perl 6</li></ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>blocking on real-world stuff this past week</li>
<li>over deadline on a work project</li>
<li>still following on the lists</li></ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>haven't heard from Damian regarding his 6doc spec</li>
<li>he has responded to mailing list posts</li>
</ul>
