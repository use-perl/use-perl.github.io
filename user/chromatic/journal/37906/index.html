<p><p>On behalf of the Parrot team, I'm proud to announce Parrot 0.8.1
&quot;Tio Richie.&quot; <a href="http://parrotcode.org/">Parrot</a>
is a virtual machine aimed at running all dynamic languages.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Rat Creature #1</em>: Comrade!  We are about to feast!  Quick, get your fat carcass behind this bush and get ready!</p>

<p><em>Rat Creature #1</em>: Hello, small mammal.... Could you step in here for a moment?  I've got something to show you....</p>

<p><em>Fone Bone</em>: Can't you show me out here, where I've got runnin' space?</p>

<p><em>Rat Creature #1</em>: No!  No!  Please!  Step in here -- your friend the dragon isn't around, is he?</p>

<p><em>Fone Bone</em>: Hey, Ted!  Where you goin'?</p>

<p><em>Ted</em>: You're on yer own, Bone!  <em>(exit stage left)</em></p>

<p><em>Rat Creature #1</em>: Quick, comrade!  Start the cooking fire!</p>

<p><em>Rat Creature #2</em>: No.  You called me fat.</p>

<p><em>Fone Bone</em>: Ted!  Wait for me!</p>

<p><em>Rat Creature #1</em>: <em>(pulls Bone into the bush)</em>  Well, well... Look who's joined us for supper... Go start the cooking fire!!</p>

<p><em>Rat Creature #2</em>:  No.  You called me fat.</p>

<p><em>Rat Creature #1</em>: No?!!! What do you mean, no?!!!</p>

<p><em>Rat Creature #2</em>: And it's not the first time you've done it either....</p>

<p><em>Rat Creature #1</em>: Comrade... be reasonable! I wasn't thinking -- I was trying to catch our dinner -- this isn't the time -- I take it back.... you're not fat.</p>

<p><em>Rat Creature #2</em>: Too late!</p>

<p><em>Rat Creature #1</em>: Please, comrade!  I just want to chop him up for the stew!</p>

<p><em>Rat Creature #2</em>: And that's another thing.  I'm tired of stew!  I want to put him in a crust and bake a light fluffy quiche!</p>

<p><em>Rat Creature #1</em>: Quiche?!  What kind of food is that for a monster to eat?! .... Listen, do you think you could come back in half an hour?  We'll have this straightened out by then!

<p><em>Bone</em>: <em>(runs away)</em></p>

<p><em>Rat Creature #1</em>: (beat)  Why didn't you stop me?</p>

<p><em>Rat Creature #2</em>: Why should I?  You're so smart!

<p><em>time passes</em>

<p><em>Fone Bone</em>: <em>(hanging from a branch in a waterfall)</em>  Those rat creatures would have to be pretty stupid to follow me on to this frail, little branch!</p>

<p><em>Rat Creatures</em>: <em>(follow Bone on to the frail, little branch)</em>

<p><em>Fone Bone</em>:  Stupid, stupid rat creatures!!  <em>(branch breaks)</em></p>
