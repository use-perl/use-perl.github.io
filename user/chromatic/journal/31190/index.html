<div class="span8">
<p><p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/stevan">Stevan</a> asked me to write some XS code for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Class::MOP">Class::MOP</a>, and it sounded like more fun than painting my deck or writing the non-fiction book, so I dodged segfaults for a couple of hours this afternoon.</p>

<p>The Perl XS API has its own kind of consistency.  It's never really stuck in my brain, but it's just familiar enough that I sort of know what I want.</p>

<p>In theory, you can do anything from C that you can from Perl.  In practice, try  manipulating typeglobs from C.  Though deleting an element from a typeglob is straightforward in Perl (once you realize that you can't really <em>delete</em>, you just have to create a new glob, copy in everything you don't want to delete--if it exists--, then assign the new glob in the old symbol table), that's really difficult in C.  I don't just mean dealing with refcounts and garbage collection, though that's a little tedious.  You can get some seriously complex code that goes seriously wrong in many weird ways.</p>

<p>Then I asked myself what I was doing and why I couldn't just delete the elements.  It works that way, even with using the standard XS macros.</p>

<p>(I showed <a href="http://gisle.aas.no/perl/illguts/#gv">The GV and GP sections of PerlGuts Illustrated</a> to a friend who said it looked like gibberish.  Sadly, I know what it's talking about and it looks mostly gibberish to me too.)</p></p>

<h2>Shame XS wasn't &quot;better&quot;</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2006-10-02T12:58:56</h3>
If XS could have been a bit more pre-processed than it is, it could have been so much better. Things like accessing hash values and references in XS is more painful than it could be with a little pre-filtering.
