<p>Allison</p>
<ul>
<li>the exceptions design document is done</li>
<li>the next bit is the implementation</li>
<li>Chip would like to finish namespaces before we implement exceptions</li>
<li>I agree</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Jesse</p>
<ul>
<li>any response to the final Artistic 2.0?</li>
</ul>

<p>Allison</p>
<ul>
<li>no
<li>I haven't taken it to the OSI for approval and deprecation of Artistic
	  1.0</li>
</ul>

<p>Jesse</p>
<ul>
<li>will that have repercussions as Perl 5 is still under Artistic 1.0</li>
</ul>

<p>Allison</p>
<ul>
<li>it's still approved</li>
<li>I'd just like to have it removed from their list of recommended licenses
	  for new projects</li>
</ul>

<p>Nicholas</p>
<ul>
<li>should <code>h2xs</code> get an update for the new license?</li>
</ul>

<p>Allison</p>
<ul>
<li>not until Perl 5's license changes</li>
</ul>

<p>Jesse</p>
<ul>
<li>we shouldn't worry about that until we get the OSI's blessing on AL 2.0</li>
</ul>

<p>Nicholas</p>
<ul>
<li>haven't done much programming since last time</li>
<li>I have an idea about fixing global discussion of inside-out objects in
	  Perl 5</li>
<li>that came up on p5p lately</li>
<li>have a question about the p5to6 translator</li>
<li>how is it?</li>
<li>we haven't seen the SoC student on p5p</li>
</ul>

<p>Larry</p>
<ul>
<li>I've been working with him, he's doing okay</li>
<li>he hasn't been mostly interrogating the Perl 5 people</li>
<li>he's working with the version I produced, rather than bleadperl</li>
<li>just for a stable base</li>
<li>feeding the YAML through his program</li>
</ul>

<p>Nicholas</p>
<ul>
<li>the bleadperl version isn't perfect</li>
<li>if you enable it, it fails some regression tests</li>
<li>we tweaked things since you added it</li>
<li>I hoped that your student would be capable of fixing these things</li>
</ul>

<p>Larry</p>
<ul>
<li>I think he's better off concentrating on the backend</li>
<li>let me concentrate on the MAD part</li>
</ul>

<p>Nicholas</p>
<ul>
<li>I discouraged people from smoking it as it fails tests</li>
<li>I don't want to pre-break our windows</li>
</ul>

<p>Larry</p>
<ul>
<li>mostly working full-time this week</li>
<li>heavy debugging mode right now</li>
<li>am watching IRC and thinking about the questions people ask</li>
<li>thinking about disallowing constructs that look like postfix operators
	  but aren't</li>
<li>did a bit of Synopsis doctoring on that</li>
<li>also studying about how to put continuations over a VM that doesn't
	  support them</li>
</ul>

<p>Patrick</p>
<ul>
<li>out of the office on vacation most of last week</li>
<li>have been answering various PGE and parsing questions</li>
<li>after YAPC, lots of people are writing parsers using PGE</li>
<li>Ruby, JavaScript, various other starting efforts</li>
<li>helping them to improve their grammars</li>
<li>also asking and answering questions on par-por</li>
<li>chatting on IRC</li>
<li>answering issues</li>
<li>not happy about variable handling in the Perl 6 compiler</li>
<li>will do that differently here soon</li>
</ul>

<p>Jesse</p>
<ul>
<li>have my full draft of the State of Perl 6 roadmap</li>
<li>relatively happy with it</li>
<li>hope to do some wordsmithing before sending it out</li>
</ul>

<p>Patrick</p>
<ul>
<li>with the contributor license agreement, is that a bottleneck for getting
	  a commit bit?</li>
</ul>

<p>Allison</p>
<ul>
<li>as soon as Kevin Tew's contributor agreement arrives in the mail, he'll
	  get it</li>
<li>we may not have to wait for it to arrive, but there's potential for some
	  confusion there</li>
<li>I can give them a fax number</li>
<li>I don't want to put that on the license agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>Jesse</p>
<ul>
<li>j2.com offers free incoming faxes</li>
<li>we could have something generic and webable there</li>
</ul>

<p>c</p>
<ul>
<li>is there a hackathon space on Sunday?</li>
</ul>

<p>Jesse</p>
<ul>
<li>when does O'Reilly get access to the conference center?</li>
</ul>

<p>Allison</p>
<ul>
<li>we do have a room available on Monday and Tuesday</li>
</ul>

<p>Patrick</p>
<ul>
<li>me and Chip and Jerry at least will hack on Sunday</li>
</ul>

<p>Allison</p>
<ul>
<li>one of the hotel lobbies might work better</li>
<li>the convention center on Sunday might be chaotic</li>
</ul>

<p>Patrick</p>
<ul>
<li>and there won't be wireless in the convention center</li>
</ul>

<p>Allison</p>
<ul>
<li>Monday and Tuesday will be a lot easier</li>
<li>OSCamp attendees get access to the tutorial snacks and wireless</li>
</ul>

<h2>More context please</h2>

<p>I appreciate the effort you're making to communicate these.  At the risk of increasing your burden, it'd be nice if you could add some additional context; maybe a paragraph or two at the beginning describing what people had been doing previously (or what others <em>thought</em> they had been doing).</p>
<p>Something like </p><blockquote><div>When we last left our heroes<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</div></blockquote>:-)

<p>I'm not chromatic, but as someone who could conceivably be taking the minutes in the future, I think this is pretty tricky. The minutes record what was said on this week's call, and the person writing the minutes has no more information to hand than what you see here. Anyone can read what people were doing previously from previous weeks minutes (once sufficient weeks build up). As to what others thought that someone was doing - I'm not sure how to find a representitive sample of people to poll to gather that. And if anyone on the call remembers that someone didn't report on an activity that they had previously said they would be doing, then that question will get minuted, along with its answer.</p>

<p>I understand.  I just want something that would make it clearer to me (and hopefully others) what was going on.  Even an opening list of "who was on the call and what they're doing (last week) on Perl6" would help.</p>

Chromatic is just picking this up (after the last summarizer moved on to other projects). I think that with him doing this regularly, it should begin to feel more coherent over time.

<blockquote><div>I have an idea about fixing global discussion of inside-out objects in Perl 5</div></blockquote>
<p>That seems to have got rather lost in translation. It's probably my fault for talking to quickly, and not pausing for breath. What I meant was actually:</p>
<p>Following investigating troublesome code with <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/clkao/journal/" title="perl.org">clkao</a perl.org>, I found some issues with the assumptions behind the current attempt at ordering in the global destruction of objects. I don't have any solution (and it's not clear if there is one), and I've not had time to write them up and mail perl5-porters. There seems to be some sort of grue eating all my CFT.</p>
