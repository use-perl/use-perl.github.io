<p><strong>The Incubated Hacker:</strong>
<blockquote>
Let's summarize:
<ul>
<li>Waiting on the technical reviewers to comment on the
book.  The early rumblings are positive, though they seem to
want more technical content.  That's fair.  So do I.</li>
<li>Of the new stuff I wrote for the book, the original
software's author thinks one bit is super cool (or at least
the description) and a fellow developer is using it as an
example for building his own stuff.  Someone else
recommended it be included in the software itself.  Fine by
me.</li>
<li>Wrote a patch to add &lt;LINK&gt; tag support to
<a href="http://slashcode.com/">Slash</a>, at the behest of a Mozilla developer. 
The navigation bar's pretty nifty.  I just had to figure out
where it was, first.  It supposedly works in iCab too, Pudge.</li>
<li>Reviewed <em>The Space Child's Mother Goose</em> from <a
href="http://www.purplehousepress.com">Purple House
Press</a>.  If you have kids, you should consider it.</li>
<li>Thinking about writing my own Roguelike.  I should
finish PerlRogue for the Perl Power Tools project first.</li>
<li>Thinking about getting a real job.  Send money.</li>
</ul>

<strong>The Man Himself:</strong>
<blockquote>
I cooked stir fried pork with veggies over rice, tonight. 
It needed more brown sugar, but the pork turned out juicy
and tender.  The secret is to wash it after you cut it up,
then dry it well.  It helps to put olive oil and brown sugar
in the pan first, and get it super hot -- sear in the juices.
<p>
I also realized that my wayward Texas friend is NOT
interested in reconciliation.  That's probably not news. 
The decision was probably made months ago.  Hey, I did
everything in my power to make things right.  I don't like
the fact that my good intentions weren't enough, but I
deserve better than to be kept in the dark, mocked, and
subsequently ignored by someone I considered a friend.
<p>
So that's a weight lifted from my shoulders, oddly enough. 
I didn't get what I thought I wanted (my best friend back),
but I'm not going to waste any more time moping about it. 
Better to use that time finding other people who appreciate
me and who are actually willing to *talk* when there's
something wrong.

<strong>Not That I've Learned Anything:</strong>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.dave.org.uk">davorg</a> posted a <a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&selm=3BD47402.3B1BDFDB%40dave.org.uk">plea</a>
for someone to write a good introduction to programming with
Perl and CGI.  The two excellent books that somewhat fill
the gap are <em>Learning Perl</em> and <em>Elements of
Programming with Perl</em>, but they don't take that
approach.  Of the books that do, most have insecure, buggy,
clunky code and teach bad habits.
<p>
So I'm thinking of writing a proposal for my second book:
teaching absolute novices <strong>how</strong> to program 
<strong>Perl</strong> to write <strong>CGI</strong> programs.  Am I stupid?  Good enough at Perl?  Even grudingly respected?
<p>
Or I could learn to get up before 9 am and get a real job
like my brother.

<h2>perl &amp;amp; cgi intro</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2001-10-25T14:18:54</h3>
<p> <a href="http://www.ora.com/catalog/perlwsmng/" title="ora.com"> <i>Perl for Website Management</i> </a ora.com> is coming out in November and is the absolute best book I've seen for people who don't necessarily want to be Perl programmers but do want to use Perl for their website. I'm a bit disappointed that they moved the book from the very nicely formatted Web design series into the regular format but either way, the basics are covered and I'm hopeful the author added a bit of an intro to using databases with cgi for websites since I last saw it. </p><p><p>The book that needs to be written is A DBI Cookbook, not yet another beginners book on "how to do Perl the way I do"...</p>

The DBI book isn't enough? Mind you, I can't actually think of enough DBI recipes to fill a book.

Same here.  Mind you, hfb scares me enough that I've never had the courage to disagree with her.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

I have it, and a few others, which I plan to look into on Monday<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I'll have to install it locally and take a look, see how it works.  I love the idea though; I've often <a href="http://pudge.net/macperl/tpc/2001/tpc_2001_presentation/" title="pudge.net">supported this</a pudge.net> but never actually saw a client use it.  Although Mozilla doesn't seem to support it will<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... there is no Contents button, and to get to Start, Prev, and Next, I need to click More.  Fooey!

Hm, I removed something I had installed, restarted Mozilla, and next/previous/top work now, as does contents.  Cooool.  I gotta revamp makeslides now to take care of the rest (first/last/up).
