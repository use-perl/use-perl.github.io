<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 19 March 2008.  Larry, Allison, Will, Mitchell, Jesse, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>indisposed last week</li>
<li>getting half a gallon of blood put into me in the hospital last week</li>
<li>had various tests, all negative, so probably something not too terribly obvious</li>
<li>going in for a lower endoscopy in a week or two</li>
<li>will probably know more then</li>
<li>probably something benign that's just leaking blood slowly</li>
<li>I do feel better than I did a week ago</li>
<li>it's amazing how much more quickly I can walk, when my blood doesn't think that I'm up at 14,000 feet altitude</li>
<li>hopefully thinking more clearly too</li>
<li>or at least less unclearly</li>
<li>mostly getting caught up and doing some spec clarifications about the semantics of list assignment to arrays</li>
<li>what you can or can't assume about the batching of asynchronous read operations</li>
<li>did throw in one new feature this morning</li>
<li>I wanted badly when I wrote a Perl 5 program last week</li>
<li>there's no easy way to say "match as much of this string as you can, then pretend as if you succeeded, ignoring the rest of the string"</li>
<li>it's very useful for matching abbrev. and such</li>
<li>each subsequent character is optional, but only if the previous one matched</li>
<li>nested optional characters</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we've had some horrible hacks to work around that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I put in syntactic sugar for that</li>
<li>we'll see how it works in practice</li>
<li>tried to figure out which rules can be rewritten and which can't, reliably</li>
<li>thinking about the future of the bootstrap I've been working on with standard 5</li>
<li>trying to figure out what the blockers are on bootstrapping</li>
<li>next travel is to YAPC::Asia</li>
<li>will stop in Seattle</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mitchell:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>struggling to get to a usable Perl 6 implementation</li>
<li>tried to use the Rakudo parser and dump the parse tree, to go to a separate backend</li>
<li>making pretty good progress</li>
<li>the parser is a bit slow, though</li>
<li>40 seconds to parse 700 lines of code</li>
<li>not quite tractable</li>
<li>back to looking at a hand-transliteration of <em>STD.pm</em> into Ruby</li>
<li>it's starting to gel</li>
<li>may be a new attempt this week to use a slapped on backend to get to a usable Perl 6</li>
<li>whenever standard 5 matures, it can be swapped in for the Ruby parser</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>is there anything anyone else can do to help you on this?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mitchell:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>once it can do Perl 6, there's a world of possibilities</li>
<li>until it actually runs, there's not much for anyone else to do</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>working on the Unicode/character set PDD</li>
<li>gradually changing its name to just "strings"</li>
<li>Simon had a very good first draft</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>does he know you're working on it?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll mail him</li>
<li>gave a talk at Microsoft to their DLR/CLR groups about Parrot</li>
<li>then met with their open source lab</li>
<li>they'll do smoke testing for us on several different versions of Windows</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we released Parrot 0.6.0</li>
<li>most of the big changes are in the PMC PDD, which landed</li>
<li>we've also had a big push to close new and old bugs in our system</li>
<li>should give us a lot of energy in the near future</li>
<li>right now I'm looking at a way to profile Parrot apps at the PIR level</li>
<li>good optimizations available there only after we can measure them</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mitchell:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>did you look at KCachegrind?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I did, also the Devel::DProf format</li>
<li>the big work so far seems to be instrumenting Parrot appropriately to detect spots where we need to measure things</li>
<li>haven't yet decided which output format to use</li>
<li>Valgrind is necessary if you use the Cachegrind format from KCachegrind</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>TPF is now an official part of GSoC 2008</li>
<li>haven't seen any Parrot or Perl 6 specific hits for the Summer of Code</li>
<li>I'll send out something to the Parrot and compiler lists trying to recruit students</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mitchell:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>is there a way to send mail to Perl Mongers groups?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I think Eric sent mail to the monger managers</li>
<li>are there any Perl 6 or Parrot talks that aren't on the schedule yet for YAPC?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>maybe "getting started with a little language"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>or "implementing a Perl 6 feature"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll send mail to the lists</li>
</ul></p>
