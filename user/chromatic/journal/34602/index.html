<p><blockquote><em>Most people consider a language as OO, if OO is built-in. Perl does not fall in that category.</em></blockquote>

<p>&mdash; <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=641932">Cop</a> in <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=642469">Re^5: Tired of "Perl is dead" FUD ?</a></p>

<p>I must have been very fortunate in that all of the versions of Perl 5 I've ever used on all of the platforms I've ever used have had some magical, non-core extension included such that <code>bless</code> and method dispatch work.  I find that somewhat surprising however, given that I've downloaded and compiled Perl myself from pristine sources a fair few times.</p>

<p>I find myself edging so much closer to believing that people who do not know anything about programming languages and who also feel some strange compulsion to talk about the subjects of their vast ignorance and inexperience should wear badges warning the rest of us not to waste our time listening.  I realize that the things they say are, effectively, such badges... but I feel badly for other people whose sense of irony is not nearly as fine-tuned as is mine.</p>

<p>For those of you without such experience, let me be clear.  What I have quoted is the stupidest statement about programming that I have read this week.</p></p>

If Cop is the same person as the earlier anonymous coward, one look at his website should be enough to write him off an someone with little to contribute about software (and certainly web) design.<br>

Andrew Hanenkamp seems to have started <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/POE-Declarative/lib/POE/Declarative.pm" title="cpan.org">writing a DSL</a cpan.org> in Perl - a feat that we've heard is not possible.

My biggest problem with Perl is that I can't output with a newline or separate print arguments with spaces!!
