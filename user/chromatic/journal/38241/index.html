<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 17 December 2008.  Larry, Patrick, Allison, Jerry, Jesse, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>chasing for Hague grant reports</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>produced a report-in-kind -- I prepared a presentation on it for Richard</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>finishing up jetlag from my round the world trip</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>lots of hacking over the past two weeks, as I missed the call last week</li>
<li>Rakudo passing on the order of 5170 tests, up by 500 from two weeks ago</li>
<li>suspect similar rate of improvements over next 2 weeks, modulo vacations</li>
<li>can now embed PIR directly into Perl 6 functions; one more piece of the puzzle to write the prelude in Perl 6.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>in a block?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's a quote, <code>q:PIR { }</code></li>
<li>if your code returns anything it becomes the value of that quote</li>
<li>it's how Perl 6 specifies it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>slightly off, in that Perl 6 uses a capital Q</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we can fix when Jonathan's branch goes in today</li>
<li>I was cheating - Rakudo was saying that everything capital was a type</li>
<li>Reduction and some hyperoperators now implemented.</li>
<li>Array slices, hash slices, list [???] working</li>
<li>[???] working catch blocks, I think we've just added control exceptions.</li>
<li>We now have the nil type, so returns work correctly.</li>
<li>when blocks inside subs work almost completely correctly.</li>
<li>[???] interpolation fixed up</li>
<li>Did work on the sort algorithm; put a trial balloon up on specifying</li>
        just the value you want to sort on, rather than the comparison operator.
<li>After Friday the kids go away on Christmas break, so I should get no</li>
        interruptions.
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>last night gave a couple of lightning talks at the Seattle Perl user group</li>
<li>one was "New items in Rakudo Perl in 0.8.2" - it definitely took more than 5 minutes. :-)</li>
<li>committed first draft of S19, the command line interface.</li>
<li>it's not complete</li>
<li>I have a few edits pending. Only gotten one or two reviews so far</li>
<li>would like more eyes on it.</li>
<li>dealing with Parrot Foundation things.</li>
<li>trying to set up getting Parrot out of the Rakudo repository, if you want to look at it that way.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there is a twitter feed http://twitter.com/rakudoperl</li>
<li>whenever a new feature shows up in Rakudo I Twitter it - it's trivial from IRC.</li>
<li>you get a running feed, without me needing to stop and write a blog post, or getting bogged down in detail. Blog posts remain for detailed descriptions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>did a couple of blog posts. Will be blogging shortly about S19</li>
<li>0.8.2 released. We did miss a couple of roadmap items, which makes me a little concerned</li>
<li>we can make a bit up, but it still affects things</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>fixed a couple of bugs</li>
<li>reviewed the numbers PDD</li>
<li>we should definitely use IBM's standard decimal arithmetic library</li>
<li>my only concern is distribution and the implications on Rakudo</li>
<li>otherwise, proposed a feature and patch to p5p</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>released 5.8.9</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>set up the Ubuntu package archive</li>
<li>not quite automated, but close</li>
<li>that'll get us better testing from the Ubuntu folks</li>
<li>they can just enter our package archive in their F<sources.list></li>
<li>every one of our updates will appear in their system</li>
<li>spent a lot of time cleaning up branches</li>
<li>haven't committed the install branch yet, but have a smaller patch</li>
<li>also working on the calling conventions branch</li>
<li>I'm now adding changes one at a time to the new branch in logical units</li>
<li>commiting those in passing chunks</li>
<li>started talks about migrating Subversion to parrot.org, probably after the January release</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Rakudo will stay on perl.org</li>
<li>should I try to stick that in the existing Perl 6 repository</li>
<li>or would that be a good time to move to Git, considering that Perl 5 is moving to Git?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that has potential</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's hosted by Booking.com</li>
<li>github offered hosting</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>seems like doing both at once is useful</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you're coupling migration and tool switching</li>
<li>how much will that slow people down?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I don't think it'll slow us down from the people primarily working on it</li>
<li>it'll happen around the same time as the move anyway</li>
<li>ideally the Rakudo stuff should move before Parrot does</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'd like to see instructions on downloading, making local changes, and submitting a patch</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>post-January we could take a week of no features</li>
<li>just documentation</li>
<li>we need to explain how to get Parrot and such as well</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>productivity is a concern</li>
<li>the Perl 5 conversion has shown that</li>
<li>minimizing downtime is important to aim for as well</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it would be nice to have a champion who isn't Patrick</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I might be able to find one of the "Git is the second coming" people on the channel to do that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I thought it was the first coming</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's Obama</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>no, they branch him and commit their own hopes and dreams to him using Git</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll look into that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>don't forget the perl.org DNS</li>
<li>it's reasonable to have an A record rakudo.git.perl.org</li>
<li>you can clone that, but the source can move</li>
<li>you decouple the name from the repository</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>now might be the right time to do this</li>
<li>because Rakudo is starting to be useful to write useful things</li>
<li>I planned to post to Rakudo.org and other places</li>
<li>it might be interesting to solve some of the problems from Microsoft's scripting games</li>
<li>no one's done Perl 6 solutions for those yet</li>
<li>good idea/bad idea/landmines?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the consequences will be that people report bugs and make Rakudo better</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>bug reports are highly useful</li>
<li>they tend to drive our development better than anything else</li>
<li>I hope that people will solve those problems but not run into showstoppers</li>
<li>we may be close to that level</li>
<li>do I have to worry about any IP concerns?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we may not be able to check them into the repository</li>
<li>but we could check in original code as tests, if you wanted</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I had no idea in mind to collect these anywhere</li>
<li>just have people post to their blogs "I tried this problem; here's a solution"</li>
<li>I want to spread out the answers as far as I can</li>
<li>more people will have a chance to run across them and comment and show how things are really happening</li>
<li>that will happen sometime this week</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>will <code>make install</code> be a prerequisite to Rakudo leaving the repository?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'd like to know what Rakudo will do</li>
<li>I might do the Tcl approach of "check out into the Parrot repository"</li>
<li>if it hasn't made much progress in the next couple of weeks, I'll have to do it myself</li>
<li>getting that target right is more important than the PGE changes</li>
<li>from a Rakudo perspective, I need to know what it looks like</li>
</ul>
