Last week, the <a href="http://www.libc.org/">Linux in Boise Club</a> allowed me to present a short talk.  Since they found me through my Perl work, I gave a small advocacy talk entitled <a href="http://wgz.org/chromatic/talks/Why_I_Like_Perl/">Why I Like Perl</a>.  It went really well, though having several books and miscellaneous pieces of swag to give away always helps.
</p>
<p>
You might notice that there's not a lot of traditional "advocacy" in the style that turns people off.  I was more interested in talking about the advantages of Perl that I enjoy than discussing the bits of other languages I don't enjoy.  In retrospect, that worked pretty well -- there were several interesting questions about Parrot, Ruby, and Java.

<p>In <a href="http://wgz.org/chromatic/talks/Why_I_Like_Perl/Why-I-Like-Perl-slide-10.html" title="wgz.org">slide 10</a wgz.org>, line 2: "invididual" should be "individual".</p>
<p>A very nice presentation.  I was initially surprised at the number of slides, but I later realized there's a <em>lot</em> of information there.</p>
<p>I agree with you that this is the right way to do advocacy, not "Perl wins, (what-have-you) loses".  If anything, I would point out how some ideas in Perl, like the syntax cleanup for regular expressions, have found their way into other languages.</p>

Thanks, that typo's now gone.
</p>
<p>
The topic of "borrowing" Perl regexes did come up.  It's invisible on the slides, right under the mention of <a href="http://www.pcre.org/" title="pcre.org">PCRE</a pcre.org>.
