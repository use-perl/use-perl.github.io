When someone says ``I want a programming language in which I need only say what I wish done,'' give him a lollipop.

<p>That's funny.  I had forgotten that "It should be possible to translate specifications into defect-free programs automatically" was a full-sentence false cognate with "I like candy".  Another fun fact is that "Programming is like construction or (manufacturing)" is a full-sentence false cognate with "I know very little about building software and construction (or manufacturing)."</p>

I see the same sort of future, but without the "extinction of software engineers".  Engineering is a design process, and design is something that most humans can't get right anyway.  (For the <i>case in point</i>, see "traffic engineering" (at least in the US), "almost any random kitchen appliance", or "the i-phone."  Also see the past several years of interface/interaction design theory -- which have yet to establish any sort of closed formula for addressing design issues in a generic or product-agnostic way.)<br><br>Tellingly, I don't see Perl in the categories of Hans-Eric's blog.  If programming is "repetitive and error-prone", <em>you're doing it wrong!</em><br><br>Of course, my idea of the future probably defines "tell the computer" in a slightly different way than his.  For "do what I mean" to work, you need concision, which involves an advanced vocabulary, context-sensitivity, and lots of other complicated concepts which will never be accessible to the mentally mundane.<br><br>So, how long will it take this amazing future of high-level, advanced interaction to get here?  That's really a question of economics.  How much are we paying the whiz-bang programmers who are building this future?  And, do they have access to each other's source code?

The boss of my boss once changed from a CS professor to a hardware designer, and the cranky pronouncements of the kind "why can't we just spec the software and press a button and the software automagically comes out from the other end" soon started.<br>

<p>I remember translating a program from source code into machine code by hand once, in the '80s, just to see if I could.  That magic button is a compiler.</p>

I think he was more thinking along the lines of "insert a formal spec, out comes an application" (and out of the door go the now unnecessary programmers).<br>
