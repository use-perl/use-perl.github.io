<h2>eh</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rjbs/">rjbs</a> on 2007-10-31T13:02:57</h3>
This guy's rant strikes me as pretty obnoxious.<br><br>We don't know what the content of the emails in question was.  It may very well have been, "Hi, I really enjoy reading your feed, it's full of really interesting stuff, but I tend to find that I skip everything classified X.  Would it be possible for you to make two feeds, one for X and one for Y?  I think other people would benefit from this."<br><br>There is absolutely nothing arrogant about that email.  The recipient is free to ignore it, to do what the sender asked, or to reply, "No, sorry, it's just not worth my time."  (There are other options too:  "Fuck off, ass." or "Consider trying Yahoo! Pipes to customize the feed on your own." are two others.)<br><br>Getting upset because someone would dare ask a favor is ridiculous, and just goes to further erode any expectation of civility.  Yes, plenty of people have a sense of entitlement, but politely asking a favor can be an act of showing respect: it shows that you value someone (because you feel they can be of service to you) and that you respect them (because you ask with deference).<br><br>(I can get behind that quote if the "ask" is replaced with "demand," though, and I certainly witness that all the time.)

<h2>Perhaps some context would help</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jbrains/">jbrains</a> on 2007-11-09T07:54:56</h3>
<p>rjbs, I hope you don't mind my providing some context, because I don't think it's necessarily obnoxious to stand up for one's friend.</p>

<p>I interpreted what Reg wrote as saying he was upset by receiving these requests, although I never confirmed that with him. He did say he was thinking of giving away less free stuff, so that was a pretty big clue. His follow-up, calling my remarks "refreshingly frank" further hinted to me that he saw me standing up for him, rather than overblowing the situation.</p>

<p>I mention this only because it was my intention to do something positive by standing up for people, like us, who give a lot away. Yes, we do it because we like it, but every time a person  takes advantage of our good nature, he chips away at that enjoyment. I thought I saw that happening and I decided to speak out.</p>

<p>I would like to edit something I wrote. I wish I'd written "You want a custom experience? Offer something, like money, sincere gratitude or some other quid pro quo." I judge from chromatic's response that he believes I'm hung up on money. I don't think I am. I simply found the situation wrong and I wanted to speak up about it.</p>

<p>Thinking back, I stand behind my sentiment: I think it's arrogant to ask for more free stuff without offering something in return. To claim there is "absolutely nothing" arrogant about it seems to be a difficult position to defend. As usual, the truth is somewhere in the middle. I could have done a better job editing my comments, but the sentiment remains. To expect more free stuff from someone who already gives you a lot of really good free stuff is, well, not cool.</p>

<p>Take care.</p>

<p>Not one bit!  I'm hung up on people who complain about release dates of free software they haven't even contributed gratitude toward.  I can't remember you ever being in that category, so as far as I can remember you're a decent human being who wrote something I thought I could twist toward my nefarious purposes.</p>

I don't mind getting requests for free somethings, as long as they are not so frequent as to constitute a denial of service attack on my day.  I just mind it when they have an implicit expectation that they will be granted.  Those kinds of requests I expect only from my wife and employer.

A handful of times a year someone asks me for a new feature in one of my modules.  About a third of the time I say "no, I think that's a bad idea, because [blah blah blah]".  Another third of the time I say "no, I think that functionality would be better put in a subclass or a wrapper, here's the API you should use to talk to my code - and if my docs are unclear please let me know so I can fix that bug".  And about a third of the time I say "great idea, here it is, please test".<br/><br/>There's only something wrong with asking for something for free when you won't take no for an answer.

There's only something wrong with asking for something for free when you won't take no for an answer.</div>  <p>Exactly. I think a lack of willingness to delete or ignore the stuff you don't want to read is pretty much the same as not taking no for an answer.</p>

<p>How would you feel if someone asked you to remove a bunch of superfluous features from your module? (Your module is probably really good, so pretend you have superfluous features.)</p>

If I agree that the feature is superfluous, then I might document it as being deprecated, make it spit out a warning (which can be turned off) and eventually remove the feature a few years down the line.  In fact I'm about to do that with Number::Phone.  But first I need to be convinced that it's superfluous.  But merely saying that the feature can be implemented by the user with such-and-such a combination of calls to my other functions isn't enough to convince me.  I need to be convinced that the feature itself is Bad.  In the case of Number::Phone, supporting three different calling conventions is a Bad Thing.

Thanks, but I didn't ask you what you would do; I asked you how it would make you feel. I can infer something from your response, but I'd rather not do that.

Here you are then - it wouldn't bother me in the slightest.

<h2>Sure, it applies to free software</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jbrains/">jbrains</a> on 2007-11-09T08:16:30</h3>
I think it absolutely applies to free software. If I want a new feature, I ask what I can do to help. It could be money, feedback, test cases, patches, pairing. There are a number things I can and do offer. Mostly, though, when a free software project releases new code, I just say "Thank you" in some way.

<p>That's almost always more than sufficient.  Certainly a sincere "thank you" motivates me as much as anything does.</p>
