<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 28 October 2009.  Larry, Allison,
Patrick, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>unified nouns and terms in the grammar into a single category</li>
<li>they're really the same thing</li>
<li>did more spec work</li>
<li>worked on global linkage between separate compilation units</li>
<li>kicked the <code>GLOBAL::</code> package out of core</li>
<li>the linker has to pull all of those things together</li>
<li>different units have different ideas what belongs in global namespaces</li>
<li>never specified that I wanted decimal literals to show up as rationals</li>
<li>documented that literals stay exact as long as they can</li>
<li>there was no specification if you match an undefined variable inside a regex</li>
<li>now it warns and fails to match, rather than matching <code>''</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>if you were looking up out of an aggregate?</li>
<li>I'd expect to get a message about an undeclared variable</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>trying not to propogate magical undefinedness without more help from the user</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>does it throw the standard "use of undefined value" warning?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it fails to continue to match</li>
<li>lots of places Parrot and Rakudo throw exceptions I think ought not to be exceptions</li>
<li>that's been getting better over time</li>
<li>people continually try to use angle brackets for lists of numbers</li>
<li>we ought to make them more DWIMmy in terms of elements, but not the type of the whole list</li>
<li>Carl pointed me at a rant of Guido's about why Python didn't take rationals from abc</li>
<li>I decided that the default <code>Rat</code> type should not be infinite precision</li>
<li>we can make one available</li>
<li>by default, it maxes out precision at something outrageous, like 64 bits for numerator and denominator</li>
<li>something that'll be easy to calculate and detect overflow on a modern processor</li>
<li>won't try to go beyond that, which'll trend to overflow</li>
<li>decided to break the symmetry with integers</li>
<li>integers don't naturally expand geometrically in terms of accuracy required</li>
<li>clarified the semantics of private accessors</li>
<li>they're very primitive, though we're mulling changes to the syntax</li>
<li>currently feels a little kludgy</li>
<li>the AST entry in a <code>Match</code> object only gets set explicitly to an AST tree node</li>
<li>no longer defaults to the string</li>
<li>the <code>$()</code> form will default to the string, if there's no AST</li>
<li>you can still get the AST/string semantics that way</li>
<li>now you can test <code>.ast</code> directly as a boolean to see if you have one</li>
<li>holding forth on #perl6 and answering questions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>watched as others took care of the Rakudo release</li>
<li>I like to list that as an accomplishment</li>
<li>worked on the new implementation of NQP and the regex engine</li>
<li>it's going extremely well</li>
<li>it passes all but one test from the Parrot test suite for NQP</li>
<li>I haven't bothered to make it parse POD comments right yet</li>
<li>worked on native support of grammars and regexes last night</li>
<li>worked on having NQP self-host today, compiling its own grammar and action methods</li>
<li>there's one runtime issue with initialization</li>
<li>then I have to fix up the makeful</li>
<li>then it'll be entirely self hosted and won't need Parrot's NQP or PGE to build or run</li>
<li>very impressed with the new grammar and protoregex features</li>
<li>makes it really easy to put this stuff together</li>
<li>frighteningly easy</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I am, after all, lazy</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>if only you had come up with this idea four years ago!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>he's too lazy for that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the code reads naturally</li>
<li>where it doesn't read naturally, I haven't put in features yet</li>
<li>has contextual operators, defined-or, direct access to PIR ops as if they were function calls</li>
<li>you don't have to box and unbox within a PIR string</li>
<li>that gets handled automatically now</li>
<li>NQP is really convenient for writing PIR subroutines</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the generated code is ~60% smaller</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's much smaller</li>
<li>if you combine PIR instructions, NQP-rx knows the types</li>
<li>you don't have to box and unbox between them</li>
<li>an integer result that goes into an op that takes a string doesn't go through a PMC for the conversion</li>
<li>fell out naturally from the PAST implementation</li>
<li>had a long IRC discussion about <code>fetch</code> and <code>vivify</code> opcodes</li>
<li><code>fetch</code> now exists</li>
<li>don't expect a huge performance improvement, but I do expect our generated code to look nicer</li>
<li>can replace eight or ten opcodes with a single opcode</li>
<li>highly reusable in many new situations</li>
<li>people will admire the efficiency of the generated code</li>
<li>started a file with various questions to record for Larry</li>
<li>hopefully that works out well</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I have to be careful about updating the file versus the spec</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll point it out to you</li>
<li>reviewed the Perl 6 book, the work of Jonathan, Moritz, and Carl</li>
<li>very pleased with the progress they're making</li>
<li>plan to contribute in the next couple of weeks</li>
<li>Jonathan updated Rakudo to work with Parrot's new PCC on trunk</li>
<li>there's a bit of a slowdown as a result</li>
<li>mostly from parsing</li>
<li>that's mostly PGE</li>
<li>not too surprised about that</li>
<li>won't worry about that, as we'll use a new parser soon</li>
<li>we'll optimize the new parser</li>
<li>need to get that a little bit further</li>
<li>then I'll put out a public call for people to profile the NQP tests</li>
<li>they're relatively small, compared to Rakudo</li>
<li>they exercise a lot of the parser</li>
<li>good place to find bottlenecks and improvements</li>
<li>our next step is to convert Rakudo to its new grammar</li>
<li>had a breakthrough last night</li>
<li>obvious place to start: NQP's grammar</li>
<li>it's heavily based on STD as well</li>
<li>I'll copy that over to a branch in the Rakudo tree and we'll build it up from there</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>mainly working on PCC merge and cleanup</li>
<li>a few fixes</li>
<li>added a function for Will that I'd planned to add for 2.0 anyway</li>
<li>released a new version of Pod::Simple, with lots of help from David Wheeler</li>
<li>that makes me look forward to Perl 6 a lot</li>
<li>the old format for parsing POD needs to die</li>
<li>working on Pynie again</li>
<li>asked for suggestions as to what to work on yesterday</li>
<li>cleaning up old code as well</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>added <code>fetch</code></li>
<li>will wait to see how that works out for NQP before adding <code>vivify</code></li>
<li>did a lot of profiling, especially with Vasily</li>
<li>Parrot trunk is as fast as or faster than it was before the PCC merge</li>
<li>otherwise, fixing bugs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>is it possible with the new NQP/PGE combination to use them as lex and yacc?</li>
<li>in the language tarball, you can ship only PIR code, not NQP code</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the short answer is "yes"</li>
<li>that's how NQP bootstraps itself</li>
<li>keeps a PIR copy in the repo</li>
<li>builds that copy into PBC files, which should be complete by themselves</li>
<li>then it uses them to compile the source twice through to get source updates</li>
<li>you could take those PIR files</li>
<li>they stand alone</li>
<li>compile them into PBC files and use that as a library</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I want to ship the PIR files</li>
<li>can ship Debian/Ubuntu packages of Pynie that depend only on Parrot</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I consider the PIR files the shippable artifacts</li>
<li>I can set up Parrot so that those files are part of the Parrot repo</li>
<li>periodically, with a discussion of periodicity, Parrot puts a copy of NQP files in the repo</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>do we need it in the tarball?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that makes it easier for Pynie and other languages</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'd make NQP a build dependency of Pynie in the packages</li>
<li>the tarball for Pynie only includes the PIR version of Pynie's grammar</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Parrot isn't completely standalone for this</li>
<li>you can use NQP to build the PIR files for a parser and translator</li>
<li>running the parser/translator does not depend on <em>NQP.pbc</em></li>
<li>the parser and translator will still depend on <em>Regex.pbc</em> and 
<em>HLL.pbc</em>, which are effectively the new versions of <em>PGE.pbc</em> and <em>PCT/HLLCompiler.pbc</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we need that PIR library with Parrot</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there are four components</li>
<li>they're separate now, but they'll be there</li>
<li>the regex engine will be a standalone <em>Regex.pbc</em></li>
<li>there's a new version of <code>HLLCompiler</code></li>
<li>those are the two biggies</li>
<li>there's a PAST compiler which compiles Perl 6 regular expressions</li>
<li>only necessary if you want to compile Perl 6 regular expressions</li>
<li>then there's NQP itself</li>
<li>I think everyone will want to have three of those four lying around</li>
<li>every language (hopefully) will use them</li>
<li>why not include them?</li>
<li>NQP doesn't need to be in the Parrot runtime</li>
<li>it can be in parrot-dev</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>my wariness comes from trying to maintain Pod::Simple outside of the Perl 5 core</li>
<li>it's painful trying to maintain that on two different development cycles at the same time</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's similar to what we have now with Rakudo</li>
<li>Parrot and Rakudo have different cycles</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I was hoping that moving NQP out of the Parrot repository helped alleviate that problem</li>
<li>NQP could have its own release cycle</li>
<li>it's an external module that people depend on and load when they need or want it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I don't expect it to evolve much after January</li>
<li>it'll be very, very stable</li>
<li>the point isn't to make NQP powerful or add lots of extensions</li>
<li>it's supposed to be simple</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>are Perl 6 grammars still changing?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>not much, in my impression</li>
<li>I suspect they might evolve toward what NQP provide</li>
<li>we have several months to try different approaches</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>what's in the repo right now will be there until 2.0</li>
<li>I was toying with the idea of using CPython's parser and parse its AST</li>
<li>still think we're better off using PGE in whatever form it ends up with</li>
<li>looking for ways to make sure that we can still ship Debian packages right away</li>
<li>even if it takes a while for NQP as a separate package to make it in</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll create a patch</li>
<li>or check in an example with the four files</li>
<li>I'll leave the existing NQP and PGE alone in the repo</li>
<li>they'll remain at least through 2.0 and the forseeable future</li>
<li>I'll set up Parrot to make it easiest for HLL developers</li>
<li>if not necessarily packagers</li>
<li>you can change that if you want</li>
</ul></p>
