<div class="span8">
<p><p>Having started <a href="http://www.wgz.org/chromatic/writeyourlife/">Write Your Life</a> the first week of October, I spent a month writing my own versions of the assignments.  (No, you probably won't ever see them.)  That was enlightening and habit-forming.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the weird not-on-a-month-boundary timing caused me to miss the start of <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">National Novel Writing Month</a> by at least a week.  That's too bad; if I'd known and could have planned for it, I would have participated.  50,000 words is intimidating, but a thousand a day is doable.  (It would have been wrong to set aside my first ever One Month Project because I know I'd probably never go back to it.)</p>

<p>The discipline of writing at a set time every day for a month was valuable though.  Instead of writing about myself (it drove me crazy to see personal pronouns in so many sentences), I've written over 7000 words of what may just become a novel in the past week.</p>

<p>You might see that online in the near future.</p>

<p>In the meantime, feeling guilty about not hacking (though not guilty enough to figure out why the JIT fixes for Parrot on AIX have broken it on Linux PPC), I've released Test::MockObject 0.15.  This version allows you to prevent logging certain method calls; that'll make many lives easier.</p></p>
