<p><p>In <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/22145.html">Should We Include a Better Alternative to File-Find in the perl5 Core?</a>, <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi</a> suggests that just as <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPANPLUS">CPANPLUS</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Build">Module::Build</a> entered 5.10 as alternatives to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN">CPAN</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?ExtUtils::MakeMaker">MakeMaker</a>, it's worth considering adding an alternative to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?File::Find">File::Find</a> to the core.</p>

<p>I understand the desire, but that kind of thinking digs the hole deeper.</p>

<p>The Perl 6 core will contain only those libraries absolutely necessary to download, configure, build, test, and install other libraries.  (That trick seems to work for free operating systems.)</p>

<p>In a better world, Perl 5 would do the same and shed a few megabytes, as well as all of the crazy baggage required to make dual-lived modules work.  Creating <code>Bundle::BloatMeHarder</code> is <em>trivial</em>.</p>

<p>The one corner case I can't quite figure out is how such a scheme would increase the likelihood of dropping support for ancient versions of Perl, such as everything older than Perl 5.8.8.</p></p>

<p>I don't like File::Find::Rule at all, and everyone seems to have their favorite.  At least I know I can make File::Find work reliably, even if it's clunky.</p>

<p>Why not create a wrapper module with better interface? That way you can keep it...and make it "better". Seems it isn't going away anyway.</p>

Can you come up with an actual reason instead of a poor analogy?  Unlike fictional vampires, File::Find only harms those who choose to be harmed by using it directly.  File::Find is more like a big fried breakfast with all that nasty fat and EVIL meat, and we have a technical term for people who say breakfast should be banned.  That term is "idiot".

Inspired by your post, I'd like to make <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/" title="livejournal.com">a post to my technical journal</a livejournal.com> (with the "perl" tag which should put it on Perlsphere), called "The Case for File-Find-Object". I'll give several use cases for tasks you can achieve with F-F-O that you cannot achieve easily with File::Find.
</p><p>
Here's a sneak preview:
</p><p>
1. Aborting from scanning a huge directory tree once you found the single or a few desired result. (See also <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/381395/how-can-i-break-out-of-recursive-find-function-once-a-specific-file-is-found" title="stackoverflow.com">this question on stackoverflow</a stackoverflow.com>). Very painful and hacky with File::Find, but trivial with F-F-O's iterative interface.
</p><p>
2. Implementing something like <tt>diff -r</tt> (recursive diff) in Perl. In F-F-O you can instantiate two different traversers to the two directories and gradually iterate one file at a time. Using File::Find you'll need to collect all the results from the two directory structures into two arrays, sort them both, and then walk over the arrays.
</p><p>
I don't have any ideas for more use cases, but I'm always open to suggestions. And using File-Find-Object all of your code can be written using method calls instead of setting global variables and other brain-damage.
</p>

How many people cut and pasted that code without realizing that it was buggy and insecure?</p><p>Which is easier, correcting all of the existing code and tutorials and documentation to add a disclaimer that File::Find is difficult to use and that there are better alternatives, or formally deprecating File::Find altogether in a new version of Perl?</p><p>(Assume that Perl 5 has a regular release schedule and thus can support a formal deprecation policy.)</p>
