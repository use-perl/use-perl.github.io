<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 29 July 2009.  Larry, Allison, Patrick, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>decided to reserve semicolon in regexp as a non-metacharacter</li>
<li>it's a sequence point</li>
<li>it's either quoted or misparsed and have run off the end of the regexp</li>
<li>it's too easy to get out of sync otherwise</li>
<li>it's like disallowing two terms in a row as a guaranteed sequence point</li>
<li>a parsing sanity spot</li>
<li>renamed non-chaining infix to structural infix</li>
<li>not that much better a description, but it's better than an inaccurate, negative word</li>
<li>pulled off the <code>:trig</code> tag</li>
<li>we always include the trig and numeric functions</li>
<li>removed their string argument modes; they're enums now</li>
<li>lexically scoped, defaults to the trig base you want</li>
<li>if someone backslashes a space or a pound sign in a regexp, we can't decide whether it's an unspace or a quoted character</li>
<li>disallowed that</li>
<li>you must use the single-quote form of quoting for space or pound sign</li>
<li>removed inadvertent backtracking from parse failures in regexps</li>
<li>semicolons now analyzed per earlier discussion</li>
<li>fixed a bunch of error messages related to the old Perl 5 form of sigils plus curlies</li>
<li>more humanization of error messages to make them less computer sciencey</li>
<li>instead of "parsefail" it now says "Sorry!"</li>
<li>people won't feel like they're turning into a robot as they're learning to program</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>will people say that Perl 6 is a sorry language?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>instead of a message complaining "couldn't find a MultiSig", whatever that is, it says "Signature failure"</li>
<li>looked for token names that'd be confusing to the novice user</li>
<li>gave them DBAs to produce more recognizable error messages</li>
<li>infix hypers had a misleading message on missing RHS; fixed that</li>
<li>put a yellow marker at the transition between the red/green parts of error messages</li>
<li>assignment op used on something too fiddly gave an error about "multiplication too fiddly"</li>
<li>fixed that to say that the <em>assignment</em> was too fiddly</li>
<li>error messages at the beginning or end of the line now marked</li>
<li>you can have an infix where you expect a term where it's not confusable as a prefix</li>
<li><code>~~</code> could be two string prefix operators, but that's useless</li>
<li>parser can now tell it's out of sync there</li>
<li><code>say ~~$something</code>, for example</li>
<li>fixed an infinite recursion bug in LTM</li>
<li>reorganized the perl6-projects.org page to make it more community oriented</li>
<li>the community aspects were in the miscellaneous section</li>
<li>that didn't seem right</li>
<li>other minor tweaks</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>gave a last-minute Parrot talk, scheduled the night before</li>
<li>filled up the room</li>
<li>lots of good comments</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>brought a lot of people to my talk</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>talked to a couple of businesses about running dynamic languages in small, embedded environments</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>going to be a couple of years</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>they know that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>gives the technology a couple of years to catch up</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>build Debian and Ubuntu packages for Parrot 1.4</li>
<li>includes a working <code>pbc_to_exe</code></li>
<li>we can build installable packages for Pynie</li>
<li>Rakudo will be able to do that soon</li>
<li>Parrot 1.4 is in Ubuntu Karmic, will be in the 9.10 release</li>
<li>the Parrot PIR book is now available in online stores, including Scribd</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Rakudo #19 released last Thursday</li>
<li>I was busy doing other things</li>
<li>Moritz Lenz did the release; it worked out really well</li>
<li>our bus number increased on releases</li>
<li>I've decided not to do any releases myself in 2009</li>
<li>I've done four; that's my quota</li>
<li>we already have release managers for September, October, and November</li>
<li>may be able to recruit someone at YAPC::EU or online</li>
<li>Moritz can tell you that it's pretty straightforward</li>
<li>I didn't even know when the release occurred on Thursday</li>
<li>I reviewed the announcement and changelog on Wednesday night</li>
<li>didn't hear anything about it until someone congratulated me in person</li>
<li>that was really nice</li>
<li>Saturday before the release I had to do some quick changes due to a Parrot hashing order change</li>
<li>quick fix there</li>
<li>attended Damian Conway's Perl 6 Tutorial</li>
<li>very enjoyable</li>
<li>pleased to see how much Rakudo implements that he covered</li>
<li>not sure if he did that on purpose; had the impression he covered what he thought necessary</li>
<li>noticed a place where Rakudo doesn't handle nested comments correctly and fixed that</li>
<li>fixed several other string bugs here and there</li>
<li>correct smart matching on <code>Code</code> blocks</li>
<li>finally have a plan to migrate PGE to the STD model without breaking the existing PGE codebase today</li>
<li>simultaneously adding new features to NQP</li>
<li>NQP will get regexp support</li>
<li>the specialized Perl 6 grammar tool will likely disappear over the next few releases</li>
<li>people who want new and fancy regexps will use NQP</li>
<li>people who want compatibility with the old stuff will continue to use it</li>
<li>compiler writers will be able to write their entire compiler (with the possible exception of builtin functions) in NQP</li>
<li>it will also be much faster</li>
<li>NQP will also become register aware</li>
<li>can declare lexicals which correspond to Parrot registers within a block</li>
<li>can write register-aware code using NQP</li>
<li>the idea is that either PCT or the grammar engine could be written in NQP</li>
<li>may not do it as an official source</li>
<li>being able to point to equivalent NQP code would be helpful</li>
<li>that'll push me a long way on my Hague grant</li>
<li>should be able to do those in the near future</li>
<li>Jonathan and I have worked out some changes to Rakudo's lexical handling</li>
<li>we plan to work on that this weekend in Lisbon</li>
<li>writing in my journal and planning for Lisbon</li>
<li>planning a major Rakudo release sometime over the next eight months</li>
<li>plan to hold BOFs and various other discussions with heavy Rakudo contributors to make a detailed plan</li>
<li>similar to the Parrot Developer Summit last November</li>
<li>that work has begun and is going well online</li>
<li>I have <code>make</code> working from an installed Parrot</li>
<li>can build Rakudo from an installed Parrot</li>
<li>think it even works on Sun environments, which Andy Dougherty is looking at now</li>
<li>there's also a simple <code>make install</code> target in the <code>ins2</code> branch</li>
<li>want to merge that to trunk</li>
<li>should be able to build and install Rakudo by the next release</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>fixed a blocker for Rakudo's lexical handling</li>
<li>going through Coverity scans; happy to see those again</li>
<li>cotto and I are still working on the design and implementation of the profiling runloop</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Rafael did smart match in blead for 5.10.1</li>
<li>Paul Fenwick found the revised RHS semantics difficult to train</li>
<li>Rafael reverted some of it</li>
<li>Ricardo Signes didn't like some of its semantics either</li>
<li>people found it a bit too smart</li>
<li>has this bit people in Rakudo yet or at all?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there are people who've said that it's too smart in Perl 6</li>
<li>the DWIMminess has been too high for them</li>
<li>there haven't been enough people saying that for us to dial it down</li>
<li>plenty of us like it as it is</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>also Perl 6 has a type system that supports it</li>
<li>the places of difficulty is where we don't distinguish between defined and undefined versions of the same type</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>from the implementation side</li>
<li>if Jonathan or I removed the right-handedness of the dispatch, we'd both choke</li>
<li>we rely on that operator for more than just smartmatch</li>
<li>MMD and grep rely on it</li>
<li>any place we rely on dispatch to the right-hand operator needs it</li>
<li>removing it would mess up our dispatching</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's impossible to optimize otherwise</li>
<li>if you have a switch statement with <code>when 1</code>, <code>when 2</code</code>, <code>when 3</code>... it's matching numerically</li>
<li>it's not a lookup in an array because the lhs is an array</li>
<li>that'd be unacceptable</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>in Perl 5, I think it calls code refs when it finds them in places</li>
<li>what does Perl 6 do?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it calls them with the lhs as the argument</li>
<li>there are some special cases like regexes I mentioned</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's what <code>grep</code> is doing</li>
<li>its first argument is one of those smart match blocks</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's how we implemented it in Rakudo</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><code>grep</code>'s first argument doesn't have to be a block then</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we could override <code>grep</code> in Perl 5 if the implementation were similar</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's cleverer than I think</li>
<li>also simpler than I think</li>
<li>it's nice to find</li>
</ul></p>
