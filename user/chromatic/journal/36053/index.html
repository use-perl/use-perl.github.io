<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 02 April 2008.  Larry, Allison, Patrick, Jerry, Will, Jesse, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>things are very busy</li>
<li>working on a very interesting problem at work that's eating my brain</li>
<li>sneaked in a few e-mails and synopsis changes</li>
<li>not much work on the STD parser, just a few nips and tucks</li>
<li>nothing earth-shaking, mostly just tune-ups in response to John M. Dlugosz and others</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>things are going well</li>
<li>wrote a draft of the second report for the Mozilla Foundation grant</li>
<li>will post it soon, perhaps tonight</li>
<li>there has been a ton going on</li>
<li>this'll be the first in a series of postings to catch up on what's happened the last three months</li>
<li>closed a few old tickets related to a deprecated feature</li>
<li>everything that uses PGE is on the new syntax</li>
<li>reviewed the PCT tutorial and sent kjs some comments and clarifications</li>
<li>halfway through that</li>
<li>the changes are all pretty minor</li>
<li>the tutorial pointed out some places where PCT needs to evolve, and I'm working on that</li>
<li>getting ready for some heavier Rakudo hacking and reviewing the test suite</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>finished the main edits to the Strings PDD</li>
<li>still adding the API reference</li>
<li>need to ask Simon and Larry to review it</li>
<li>this is the last PDD in one of the milestones</li>
<li>working on the next milestone schedule, prioritizing those</li>
<li>also breaking up tasks for the concurrency milestone</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>doing a lot of meta-work, not a lot of work</li>
<li>four Parrot proposals and one Perl 6 proposal in GSoC</li>
<li>maybe a few more on the way</li>
<li>preparing for conference season, especially the Parrot and Perl 6 workshop at YAPC::NA</li>
<li>hope to catch up with Allison while she's in town</li>
<li>though we'll probably do more meta work</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>lots of Parrot stuff</li>
<li>cleaning up build dependencies</li>
<li>removing some long-deprecated features</li>
<li>hope to merge back our branch after the next release</li>
<li>keeping on track with RT</li>
<li>talked to kjs about shoehorning his tutorial into a compiler tools PDD</li>
<li>it's a milestone, and one of the last ones</li>
<li>Allison's looking after the remaining PDDs which aren't part of the milestones</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>working with Coke to remove deprecated features</li>
<li>fixing a few segfaults and crashes, going through open tickets for ideas</li>
<li>working with a few new contributors on IRC</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>they came from Jim Keenan's visit to Toronto</li>
<li>he's preparing for the workshop at YAPC::NA</li>
<li>found people with various untested platforms</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's been very helpful</li>
<li>adding a few new features</li>
<li>talked with Mitchell about his plans for a while yesterday</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Patrick and Jerry, what do you think about my request to describe the future of Rakudo in chunkable pieces?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's one of my goals</li>
<li>I'm doing a small part of that in my report to the Mozilla Foundation</li>
<li>in a longer-term goal, I want to describe what will get us through the summer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's been on my TODO list for Parrot as well</li>
<li>Google Docs now supports Gantt charts in their spreadsheets</li>
<li>I've had positive feedback on the RT widget I posted in there</li>
<li>having something shiny and available might be good for marketing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>even having something internal that's plain text would be good</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we have existing milestones to look at as a start</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>who's planning to go to OSCON?</li>
<li>will we have Perl 6 meetings before or after OSCON?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the weekend before I have a meeting</li>
<li>the weekend after might work</li>
<li>are other people around?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm mostly free</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I was thinking of flying out Saturday afternoon</li>
<li>might need to find a place to stay</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I won't be at OSCON</li>
<li>is anyone going to YAPC::EU this year?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>probably, but not sure</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>arranging for funding, would like to go</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>hadn't planned on it</li>
<li>but if there's a group of hackers who'd like to hack, I can arrange it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there's a chance I might be able to go</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>what's the replacement for IMCC?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>PIRC</li>
<li>much cleaner</li>
<li>still lex and yacc</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>would the bytecode PMCs be a good Summer of Code project?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's pretty big</li>
<li>a C-based bytecode generation library might be a good project</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>PCT could use that instead of going to PIR and then through IMCC</li>
<li>I'll add that to the wiki</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>if the end date is in August, what if it fails and we don't know until then?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's not on the critical path</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we want it eventually, but...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we can go to Parrot 1.0 without PIRC</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>definitely</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>but if someone wants to do it outside of GSoC that's fine too</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll convince TPF to give them a medal</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we have five days to convince someone to do this project though</li>
<li>is the longest token matcher on the critical path to Perl 6.0?</li>
<li>any estimate on that, Larry?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>what I have almost works in prototype</li>
<li>it works most of the time</li>
<li>getting it robust enough to where I can use it on the grammar itself is harder to estimate</li>
<li>the main problem right now is that I'm prototyping it with tagged regular expressions if the longest token actually matches and succeeds</li>
<li>one of the ways we've defined the matching to work is that you can put assertions after the match which can fail and nullify the match</li>
<li>so the engine has to have a way of backing off on a match</li>
<li>TRE isn't up to that in its current form</li>
<li>I might have to read the code and tweak it</li>
<li>long-term, we should write something that does longest token matching in Perl 6 which does a parallel NFA traverse of the longest toking rules with the requisite backoff semantics</li>
<li>I had one of those half-written some months ago before I decided to prototype it with TRE</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>what would it take to get concurrency working in Rakudo based on what's in Parrot already?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I meant character matching in parallel, not OS-level concurrency</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>more important is MMD</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's the next one</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>a lot of things in Perl 6 depend on MMD working</li>
<li>or solving problems for you</li>
<li>otherwise you have to emulate it to make it look like what's happening</li>
<li>that's where Jonathan's holding up on stuff</li>
<li>Rakudo will too</li>
<li>MMD, strings, and concurrency are my priorities</li>
<li>may not be true from the IO perspective, though</li>
<li>my working plan for Rakudo is that I want to get it along the way with features</li>
<li>then step back and revisit PGE and the regex engine, starting with Larry's prototype</li>
<li>I'd like to do that before the summer conferences to sit down with Larry face-to-face</li>
<li>may or may not come to pass</li>
<li>but my working plan is to look at longest-token matching in PGE in mid-to-late summer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>what's the blocker with Rakudo and MMD?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Rakudo doesn't implement it yet</li>
<li>the next blocker is that we'll use MMD this month</li>
<li>then I'll be able to identify problems and potential problems</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>those notes'll feed in to the real, final implementation</li>
</ul></p>
