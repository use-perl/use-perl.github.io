<div class="span8">
<p><p>I realized this morning that my metric in <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/chromatic/journal/34685">Cutting Off the Leeches</a> was wrong.  I see Perl 5.8.7 and Perl 5.8.8 as different <em>major</em> releases because of the Perl 5's development model.</p>

<p>Anyone else who thinks that is probably also on p5p.</p>

<p>After realizing that, I now find it reasonable to support the latest point release of the previous stable major version of Perl, as well as the current stable major release.  Instead of Perl 5.8.3 (and instead of using its <em>age</em> as the cutoff point), my new oldest supported version is Perl 5.6.2.</p>

<p>Now if a module or distribution needs a new feature only present in a later version, I'll mark that specifically... but I can live with supporting Perl 5.6.2 (almost four years old) until Perl 5.10 comes out.</p></p>


<hr/>



<h2>5.6.2</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rjbs/">rjbs</a> on 2007-10-16T20:03:40</h3>
Supporting 5.6.2 is basically the same as supporting 5.6.1: the only real changes are a few dual-lived modules and that the build system was updated for some newer compilers.

<p>It's not about features, else I'd pick the exact release where the code as written stops working.  It's about what I'm personally willing to support, for free.</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:5.6.2</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rjbs/">rjbs</a> on 2007-10-16T21:27:53</h3>
For me, that's both.  I'll put "use 5.006" in the Makefile.PL.  Then, if I see FAIL results that I can tell are because of 5.6, or that never occur with 5.8, I do one of two things:  I decide, "those look fun, I'll fix them," or I decide, "oh well, time to bump up the perl requirement."<br><br>I haven't yet felt pressured into setting some kind of firm limit below which I won't support.  If I got a sufficiently-fun-looking bug report for 5.005, I'd probably investigate it.  If I got a really tedious bug report for a complex problem for 5.8.5, I'd probably change the required version to 5.8.6.

<h2>5.6.2 is quite satisfactory</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2007-10-17T01:48:58</h3>
5.6.2 is a decent version to depend on, although I believe Schwern has mentioned that 5.6.1 is the sweet spot at the moment in terms of what people are actually using.<br><br>And I think we can all agree that there's no need to support 5.6.0.



<h2>5.005_03 is still Reallity for many sysadmins</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/n1vux/">n1vux</a> on 2007-10-17T15:39:28</h3>
A module that I need to run a script identically via SSH on all hosts via 'perl -I ~/lib/perl ' command will have to be 5.005_03 compliant, sadly.<br><br>Solaris / SunOS 5.8 aka 8 is still widely deployed and supported, even though Solaris 9 and 10 are out there. Sun provides<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/bin/perl 5.005_03.  [On these systems, we set "alias" for perl56 and perl58 to our locally built perl's - installed if the app uses them.]<br><br>Applications can bring their own copy of perl with them (with DBI bindings or other XS modules), but sysadmins, who are lucky to be able to bring a key CPAN module over during early setup, sometimes have to live with the vendor Perl.<br><br>Does this mean we can't use 5.6isms or 5.8isms on CPAN? No, we can and should, much of the time, but it does mean we should consider our audience for each module (or family). Pure perl modules without pre-requistes that can be easily used by sysadmins - and are likely to be used on 'bare' or otherwise sparse/quasi-lockdown systems - have a higher need for 5.005_03 compatibility.<br><br>This is particularly true for the dual-homed modules that were added to CORE in 5.6 or later -- the 5.005 (or 5.6.x) users may need bugfixes from CPAN that current version users get from CORE. If the CPAN bugfix version gets 'use perl 5.8.2;' it won't help much those who need it.<br><br>

<p>I had just started to <em>write</em> Perl in March 1999.  If Sun wants to support an eight-and-a-half-years-old versions of Perl, talk to them about updates.  Presumably you're paying them $$$ for a reason.</p>

<p>... except, apparently, for my CPAN modules, as evidenced by all of the pissing and moaning about how I'm so irresponsible, so inexperienced, and such a misanthropic bad person because I don't care that new code doesn't run on versions of Perl released last millennium.</p>

<p>This affects new installations of programs or tools using the old Perl. And yes, like Windows, Solaris does not come with a C compiler by default, and more to the point, we have lots of machines where the C compiler is explicitly not installed. Installing a CPAN module there is of course still possible as long as it does not use XS, either with <tt>cat &gt;perllib/Some/Module.pm</tt> through a terminal session or by doing the traditional <tt>perl -w Makefile.PL</tt> dance, but compiling your own Perl is out of the question. So you got to live with the system Perl, whichever that is.</p>
<p>Of course, old, compatible versions of modules might be available on the backpan, but being backwards compatible means that I can use a module regardless of the underlying Perl. Without needing to remove all lines that <tt>use warnings;</tt> or <tt>use 5.008;</tt> just because some [ft]ool running under 5.8 put these into the template.</p>
<p>Again, personally I prefer lexical filehandles over localized globs, but if that were the only thing preventing one of my modules from compatibility with 5.005, likely I'd pull in the code from Symbol to cater to my user instead of telling them that they're leeches. But I guess name calling is par for the course with free software.</p>

<p>I left system administration in 2000, but even I still remember sunfreeware.com, and then there's ActiveState and Strawberry Perl, and Merijn's packages, and plenty of other places to get modern versions of Perl without disturbing the system Perl.</p>

<p>Again, this is the part I just don't understand.  Why are you installing new software (or upgrading old software) on a system you consider stable?  If you consider Perl 5.005_3 stable and all of the software on the box stable and you don't want to mess with those, why does it matter if the latest version of Test::MockObject won't run on Perl 5.005_3?</p>

<p>Contrarily, if you really do need new versions of libraries or tools or whatever, why are you not upgrading the rest of your software to supported versions?</p> <p><blockquote><div><nobr> <wbr></nobr><em>... some [ft]ool running under 5.8 put these into the template....

</i></div> </blockquote>
<p>For the same reason that I don't build a new house just because I need a new light in a room. I use Perl as a tool to get a job done.

I think that's where our difference in point of view comes from. You seem to see the Perl program as an end to itself and hence the environment must be made to fit the program. I see the job to be done as the central point, and whatever Perl there is will need to suffice as my tool.

If it is more hassle to hunt down the prerequisites and to fix the compatibility breakers with 5.005_03 (or whatever Perl I have available - conveniently Solaris 10 now has 5.8.4, which OSX has too) than to manually fix my data or to write a script myself from scratch, that makes any module unusable for the solution.</p>
<p>I also know sunfreeware.com and I have a system administrator who kindly installs many things from there on certain machines. But even then, these packages cannot be installed as a normal user, so it's still a major hassle to get something tested and deployed just for a small tool built from some modules.</p>

They may not be able to upgrade the system Perl, or install a newer one, but they may want to use CPAN modules, or some software that they use and *can* upgrade, requires CPAN modules.<br><br>(Of course, one problem is that by default e.g. CPAN.pm wants to install the latest and greatest  version.

<p>Some of those modern practices have really solid reasonings behind them, such as lexical warnings and lexical filehandles.</p>

<p>Again, I ask you, why do you think that people who haven't updated Perl to a version released in the past eight and a half years will upgrade to a module for <em>any</em> reason except perhaps a critical bug?  (Isn't Perl 5.005 vulnerable to the <code>sprintf</code> problem?)</p>

<p>Shouldn't these mythical people have paid support contracts if their business relies so much on stability?  I don't see any patches coming out of p5p for anything older than 5.6.2.</p>

<p>Either it is a potential for a lucrative business or just a lot of noise.  If the former, I'll happily create a frozen+backports CPAN and start billing subscribers (in thousands per month) and paying porters (in hundreds per hour.)</p>

<p>If it's just a lot of noise (which seems likely since a frozen index would be rather trivial to create), then I fail to see how it contributes to Perl, CPAN, or the community.</p>

<p>It might be free software, but it is still a market economy.  You either solve the problem yourself, form a group which mutually benefits from the solution, or write a check to someone who solves it for you.</p>

<p>All of those options are fine with me.  Complaining when someone who works on this as a hobby and who doesn't share your goal of enabling people to do something he considers stupid and risky and expecting him to do your paid work for you is not okay.</p>
