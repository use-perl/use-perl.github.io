<div class="span8">
<p><p>In <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/chromatic/journal/36449">Double-Speed</a>, I gave numbers for two Parrot optimizations that added up to a big improvement.  Several people asked for explanations.</p>

<p>The most dramatic change is a refinement on stack chunk recycling, which I
first explained in <a
href="http://use.perl.org/user/chromatic/journal/36212">Refcounting Isn't All
Bad</a>.  I've been thinking a lot lately about the difference between things
which happen often versus things which happen rarely.  Even though
continuations at the VM level mean that control flow is not always a perfect
singly-linked list of call frames, control flow is usually a singly-linked list
of call frames.  Though your call state <em>can</em> be a tree, in practice
taking a continuation is rare.</p>

<p>In Parrot, taking a continuation is the only thing that will increase the
reference count of a stack chunk.  (I assume by now that you either understand
continuations enough to know what I mean, or you can look it up for yourself.
The important point is that a continuation captures a point in the call graph
and keeps it alive as long as the continuation is alive.  This allows the
continuation to return to that point in the call graph whenever you invoke
it.)</p>

<p>When I realized this, I removed all of the other refcount manipulations from
the system.  The only remaining refcount manipulation is for creating and
destroying continuations.  That's why <a
href="http://www.parrotvm.org/svn/parrot/revision?rev=27567">Parrot revision
27567</a> gave a 30% improvement in the Rakudo-building benchmark.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.parrotvm.org/svn/parrot/revision?rev=27568">Parrot
revision 27568</a> is more interesting.  The final diff chunks, for the
<code>isa</code> vtable entry, tell the story.  Given a PMC and the name of a
class, is the PMC an instance of the class or one of its ancestors?</p>

<p>To answer this question, the function must get the name of the PMC's current
class.  That's the call to the <code>get_string</code> vtable entry.</p>

<p>The second chunk of the diff shows this function.  It performs some
calculations and caches the name, so there's a lazy-evaluation semantic here.
Then it returns a <em>copy</em> of the name.  (Don't worry -- it's a
copy-on-write copy.  I disabled COW once in Parrot for fun and, well, if
there's one optimization we're keeping, it's that one.  Yikes.)</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Strings are mutable in Parrot.  If you wanted to subclass a class at
runtime, you might grab the name of the parent class, append a counter or other
mangling to its name, and use the result as the name of the subclass.  If you
modified the same string that the parent class used in its name cache, you'd
effectively change the class's name in place.  (I should mention that strings
are in two pieces.  There's a string header and a string body.  Headers are all
of uniform size.  Bodies are appropriate to the length of the string.  This
makes GC much easier in many ways and also makes COW possible.)</p>

<p>However, if you don't actually modify the contents of the string, you've
just used up a free string header that you can't reclaim until the next GC
run.</p>

<p><code>isa</code> doesn't modify the contents of the string.  It uses it only
in a string comparison.  There are no problems there.  (Okay, that's a fib; the
string comparison might change the encoding of the class name in place, but
that's a safe operation, and actually a benefit -- lazy evaluation, again.)</p>

<p>By extracting the name-calculation operation out of <code>get_string</code>
into <code>make_class_name</code>, that vtable entry became a call to the
extracted function and then a copy on its results.  The semantics stayed the
same.</p>

<p>The <code>isa</code> vtable entry now calls <code>make_class_name</code>
directly, avoiding the copy.  Because <code>isa</code> is a hotspot, this
reduces the amount of immediately recyclable garbage dramatically.</p>

<p>There is one twist, however.  The PMCProxy PMC inherits its <code>isa</code>
vtable entry from the Class PMC, but stores its name in a different manner.
Thus the code needs to fall back on the <code>get_string</code> call if the
<code>SELF</code> PMC is a PMCProxy.  This is slightly ugly, and a better
solution is to give PMCProxy its own <code>isa</code> entry (or fill it out
more, as it exists in part).</p>

<p>Though I'm no big fan of C's memory model, it does have one useful semantic
in the distinction between stack memory and heap memory.  The implementation of
that semantic leads to plenty of bugs, but it <em>is</em> useful to be able to
mark the expected lifetime of a piece of memory.  If we could do this more
reliably in Parrot, we could ease even more GC pressure.  There are
correctness, conciseness, and ease-of-use penalties in that idea however.</p></p>

<h2>Stupid Question</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/btilly/">btilly</a> on 2008-05-25T01:46:40</h3>
You say that upgrading the encoding of the string in place is a safe operation.  I'm just wondering how well that works with multi-threading.  After all one of the big problems that Perl 5 has with multi-threading is that if you're accessing a data structure while another thread is modifying it, you're hosed.  And it proved impossible to find all of the places where this might happen in Perl 5.  Hence our migration to a very heavy threading model.<br><br>I'm just checking that Parrot is not repeating this mistake.
