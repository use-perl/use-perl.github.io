I wrote a mailing list manager today, based on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/SIMON/Mail-Audit-2.1/Audit.pm">Mail::Audit</a>.</p> <p>
My buddy circle includes people in and out of the area.  We send a lot of e-mail back and forth, making plans for weekends and weeknights and passing around interesting tidbits.  That usually means creating large address lists based on random criteria -- who's in town, who's not, who might be interested in a subject and who isn't.
</p>
<p>
A few weeks ago, we were discussing some subject or another, and my brother replied and said, "Can you guys take me off of the cc-list?  I'm not interested in this topic."  That started my brain a-thinkin'.
</p>
<p>
My little mailing list manager lets you create new, temporary mailing lists by sending an e-mail with <tt>*NEW*</tt> in the subject to the proper address.  The body has to be a list of e-mail addresses to which the mailing list will apply.  It replies with the address of the new list -- just an alphanumeric addition to the main mailing last address.  For example, if the list were <tt>sml@localhost</tt>, a list may be <tt>sml+a0f4b918@localhost</tt>.
</p>
<p>
All posts to that address go to everyone on the list.  Anyone on the list can unsubscribe by sending an e-mail with <tt>*UNSUBSCRIBE*</tt> in the subject.
</p>
<p>
It runs from a <tt>.forward</tt> file, so it's a bit slow, but it was a whole lot easier than doing this out of <tt>procmail</tt> or writing a dedicated C program.
</p>
<p>
It needs a few more features, like limiting the people who can create a mailing list and optionally preventing people not on the list from posting to it.  As well, I'm having trouble adding a little "For help, send an e-mail to this address with <tt>*HELP*</tt> in the subject" disclaimer to the end of the message body.  It doesn't seem to stick when I get an arrayref back from <tt>$audit->body()</tt>.  It doesn't do much logging, either.
</p>
<p>
It does appear to work pretty well, though, and it's 300 lines of code (including blank lines), though that's 2/3 test suite.  It's pretty good for a day's work, though, especially since I got a bit of laundry and cleaning done.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, it did absolutely nothing for finishing my book (draft due the 17th) or getting <a href="http://everydevel.com/">Everything</a> 1.0 out the door, or working on my super secret space game.  Still, it was pretty fun, and it's one more accomplishment.
</p>
<p>
Code available <a href="http://wgz.org/chromatic/perl/sml.tar.gz">here</a>, for the time being.  It's not an official module package yet; early adopters and willing patchers only.  Be sure to create an <tt>aliases</tt> file before you run it -- if it doesn't exist, it won't work.  Big limitation; probably the first I want to fix.
