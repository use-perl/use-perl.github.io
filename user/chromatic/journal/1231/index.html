<p><strong>Who's Like Us?  D*mn few -- and most of 'em are

<blockquote>
    My friend called.  Wow.  Things seem to be going pretty
well, and we'll see how they go in the future.  Somehow, all
of my hurt and anger just faded away, when I realized who it
was.  So that's one more person I know in Dallas, which
brings me to...
</blockquote>
<strong>Work:</strong>
<blockquote>
    The book will go into "production" this Thursday. 
There's obviously some stuff left to do as the copy editors
and layout folks work their magic, but the big writing
duties are over.  Since I'm barely paying the bills, it
looks like my grand experiment has fai(including the  &lt;LINK&gt; tag support).led, for now.  I need
to find a real job.
<p>
I don't know if the job offer in Dallas is still open.  I
resisted while things were shaky with my friend, and I'm
still not sure how that's going to turn out.  I'm not
superstitious, but I'm not sure I should call Jeff and ask
if he still has a place for me.  It almost seems like if he
repeated the offer, it would be a sort of sign that I should
move to Dallas.
<p>
I do like it here in the Pacific Northwest, and there's
plenty of family in the area... but not a lot of places
looking to hire a Perl guru who's just finished a book on
weblog software, with Extreme Programming and Quality
Assurance experience.  Yes, that's a hint.
</blockquote>
<strong>Programming:</strong>
<blockquote>
   I see that the <a
href="http://everydevel.com/">Everything Engine</a> is now
available under the Artistic License.  There are a lot of
modifications I'd like to make... lots of places where
performance could be improved.  Hopefully I'll have some
free time to do just that.
</blockquote>
<strong>Patching:</strong>
<blockquote>
   Fixed a <a
href="http://public.activestate.com/cgi-bin/perlbrowse?patch=12938&action=patch">bug
in Perl</a> and several in <a
href="http://slashcode.com/">Slash</a> (&lt;LINK&gt; tag support even made it to Slashdot).  I really ought to
write some book reviews, though the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/preface/">Perl
Refactoring Browser</a> looks like such an interesting
project...</blockquote></p>
