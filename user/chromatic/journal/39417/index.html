<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 08 July 2009.  Larry, Allison, Patrick, Jerry, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>sided by several design issues in the past week</li>
<li>the number of fundamental issues was higher than usual</li>
<li>refactoring the global and lexical namespaces to fit together with their symbol tables</li>
<li>Daniel pointed out a problem in my design</li>
<li>immutable type objects pointed to mutable symbol tables</li>
<li>that didn't quite work</li>
<li>had to turn that inside out</li>
<li>thinking about the exact semantics of <code>use</code></li>
<li>depends on how symbol tables work out</li>
<li>should have that soon</li>
<li>thought a lot about the nature of lists</li>
<li>are they more primitive than captures?</li>
<li>had some discussion about that</li>
<li>provisionally called <code>Parcel</code>s</li>
<li>may be correct to unify them with captures</li>
<li>a capture might just be a parcel that can deliver the positionals separately from the names</li>
<li>the actual structure might be the same thing</li>
<li>Daniel might have a complaint about it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I totally agree with the change</li>
<li>I just know it's going to muck up a few internals along the way</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we need something to give us the raw arguments in their order</li>
<li>has to be what parentheses do by default</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>agree</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that part is not negotiable</li>
<li>working on the trait mods</li>
<li>Jonathan's been refactoring that</li>
<li>still have a collision as a result of defining multis with the same name as we define the new syntax</li>
<li>may have to split those</li>
<li>the macroish thing which defines new syntax is different from the semantic declaration of the multis called</li>
<li>haven't specified that, but it seems like the right approach</li>
<li>encouraging other people to hack on the specs</li>
<li>encouraged Darren Duncan to swap <code>:auth</code>s and <code>:ver</code>s</li>
<li>he did other cleanup, which was good</li>
<li>other people have contributed too</li>
<li>doesn't seem to be out of hand</li>
<li>clarified value-producing blocks like <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>START</code> as statement prefixes</li>
<li>you don't need curlies now</li>
<li>you can still do the block form, but they're block or statement</li>
<li>you can use a statement prefix as a statement itself</li>
<li>the old model of symbol tables in STD used nested hashes</li>
<li>using a model now where symbol tables are objects which can function as hashes</li>
<li>recombined symbol tables and stashes</li>
<li>we can <code>does Hash</code> usefully and get the same benefit in a single object</li>
<li>moved back to the notion that the symbol for a symbol table in a package ends in <code>::</code></li>
<li>tried to get away from that, but it didn't work</li>
<li>it's a post-sigil, now</li>
<li>the name canonicalizer in <code>Cursor</code> now leaves the double-colon at the end of prefix packages</li>
<li>makes it simpler to look up</li>
<li>fixed a bug related to pad exporting</li>
<li>chose the wrong pad</li>
<li>now the declarand (the declared object) remembers the appropriate pad for the rest of the declaration</li>
<li>if you put <code>=$fh</code> as the only thing as a line, now it complains about an illegal POD directive</li>
<li>changed constants to be <code>our</code> instead of <code>my</code>, last week</li>
<li>more chance of name collision within packages and lexical scopes</li>
<li>I fixed the error message for a collision</li>
<li>aligned a few more things to the specification</li>
<li>changed MMD with Jonathan</li>
<li>mandatory, named parameters are part of the constraint on a multi</li>
<li>where STD uses that, it declares those parameters as mandatory</li>
<li>the spec claimed that adverbs and fat-arrow plus circumfix are semantically equivalent</li>
<li>fixed the circumfix semantics there in the parse</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>added more operators to the Rakudo setting</li>
<li>fixed a few PGE bugs</li>
<li>talked with Allison about Parrot's installation</li>
<li>mostly talked about various issues on IRC</li>
<li>lots of planning, brainstorming, and prioritization for Rakudo and Perl 6</li>
<li>starting to put together plans for how Rakudo 1.0 will look and when it will come out</li>
<li>not sure I'm the right person to work on Rakudo install refactor</li>
<li>will post a couple of messages about that to the list to recruit others</li>
<li>looks like a lot of important refactoring, but I'm not sure I'm the right person to do that</li>
<li>getting together stuff for OSCON and YAPC::EU</li>
<li>finishing up other Parrot tasks for the 1.4 release</li>
<li>especially HLL interop</li>
<li>posted instructions for other people to do releases of Rakudo</li>
<li>anyone can do a release; they don't need to wait a month to do it</li>
<li>anyone who wants to practice could just do one anytime</li>
<li>GitHub allows that very nicely</li>
<li>anyone who wants to be a release manager can practice anytime</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>working on Rakudo-exposed GC bugs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>trying to catch up on tickets and answer questions</li>
<li>halfway through the ticket queue</li>
<li>everything needs a quick skim at this point</li>
<li>have intentionally not made any plans for the next couple of weeks</li>
<li>will focus on the release (when I'm not working on OSCON)</li>
<li>can work on the install stuff</li>
<li>though I think we should do as little as possible to get it working</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I won't try to refactor Parrot's <code>make install</code></li>
<li>Rakudo wants to be able to build from an installed version of Parrot</li>
<li>may give up on installing from a build copy</li>
<li>the downloader installs Parrot to a new directory</li>
<li>the only blocker there is being able to get a fakecutable working</li>
<li>need to go through and add conditional Makefile generation to Rakudo's generate script</li>
<li>am I missing anything?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>did it ever work from an installed Parrot?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>can't do a fakecutable there; that never worked</li>
<li>I can build Rakudo</li>
<li>it can run if you run the bytecode file</li>
<li>it won't run from the <code>perl6</code> binary</li>
<li>we need something that can run from there</li>
<li>people expect that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the fakecutable works if you keep the build directory around</li>
<li>but not from an installed Parrot</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the other problem is the search path of the <em>dynext/</em> directory</li>
<li>in a few places <code>parrot_config</code> reports compiler settings that won't work on some platforms without conditional makefile generation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it'd be good to get a list of what those are</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll make that list soon</li>
<li>part of the reason I've pushed on this so hard is because we need it</li>
<li>it has to happen before Rakudo 1.0, but I'll spend my development time elsewhere</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we'll get it as soon as possible</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>as soon as practical</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I like that phrase</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>if I use a class as a role in a <code>does</code> statement, is that okay?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>with some caveats, yes</li>
<li>it takes a snapshot of the class</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>my goal between now and the end of YAPC::EU is to develop a detailed plan for Rakudo 1.0</li>
<li>would like that release to happen by next spring</li>
<li>if it happens sooner, great</li>
<li>1.0 is just a marker tag</li>
<li>beyond a developer release</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Rakudo 1.0 doesn't have to implement all of 6.0.0</li>
<li>it can be a beta of Perl 6, for example</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>need to define what things need to be in that release</li>
<li>not just spec, but ancillary features</li>
<li>before that release, we need to use something much closer to STD, if not STD itself</li>
<li>will make a list of what things need to be in there</li>
<li>I want to get Rakudo to the point where we can say "It's ready for some real uses"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>is there a performance target?</li>
<li>I'd like to see at least a doubling in speed</li>
<li>that's not entirely your problem</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that may happen on its own</li>
<li>I think that's reasonable</li>
<li>that's the minimum we can get</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>how about working with other Parrot HLLs?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>not sure it's a Rakudo or Perl 6 prereq</li>
<li>maybe Parrot</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I wouldn't put it on the Rakudo list</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we need a better module system</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>a bunch of good questions will come up</li>
<li>having a set of release managers in place will make that easier</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>July will be the last release I do by myself, assuming release managers pop up</li>
<li>and I assume they will</li>
<li>modeling this after the Parrot Development Summit last year</li>
<li>charting our progress to 1.0 like Parrot did</li>
<li>my goal is to finalize things at YAPC::EU</li>
<li>want to publish a document with milestones and timelines after that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>might be nice looking at which percentage of the spec the tests cover</li>
<li>and what Rakudo's passing tests cover</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>talked about this with Jesse</li>
<li>very good discussion</li>
<li>will go through each synopsis and review how Rakudo does with each <em>section</em> of the synopses</li>
<li>break it down, give each heading a percentage</li>
<li>would be nice if there were automated tools to help with that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>can smartlinks help?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>potentially</li>
<li>I don't want to block on it</li>
<li>might shuffle that off to someone if there's an easy task</li>
</ul></p>
