<p><p>Well, perhaps death of three little bugs anyhow.</p>

<p>Today, after work (and don't talk to me about reviewing copyedits; it was hard to imagine anything more tedious than cleaning up a manuscript before submitting it to production, yet it exists!) I wrote up a patch to fix a header-including problem in <a href="http://sdl.perl.org/">SDL Perl</a>.  I have yet to hear if that works.</p>

<p>For my next trick, I went through the huge multi-thousand line patch of changes from the SDL Perl repository to the latest release, applied the smaller and less risky changes, and divided the rest into individual chunks.  All tests still pass here.</p>

<p>With that work out of the way (hey, applying patches is fairly easy, it was breaking that huge diff into manageable chunks that was such a psychic barrier), I next bundled up <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::MockObject::Extends">Test::MockObject::Extends</a> with Test::MockObject and uploaded a new version of the latter to the CPAN.  T::MO::E will make your life easier or double your money back.</p>

<p>Finally, instead of sneaking around behind the backs of my absent buddies and playing Crystal Chronicles solo (and it's better in teams), I fixed a known bug in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Mail-SimpleList/">Mail::SimpleList</a> that caused bounce messages and errors.  On top of that, I improved the unsubscribe message slightly.  Hey, since this software helps finish the new <em>Perl 6 and Parrot Essentials</em> book, it's important.  Please upgrade, if you're running this code.  (If you're not, you probably should be.  At least, you <strong>could</strong> be.)</p>

<p>This weekend's trick will have to involve some Parrot SDL hacking, or else next month's PDX.pm meeting will be quite dull.  Fortunately, my rather unplanned month-long hiatus meant that the fabulous Jens Rieks found all of the nasty bugs and corner cases in objects, libraries, and NCI, so they're mostly fixed and possibly even documented.</p>

<p>That, and writing a couple of Linux Desktop Hacks.  Any GNOME writers in the audience care to join in?</p></p>
