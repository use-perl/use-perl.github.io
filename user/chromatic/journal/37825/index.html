<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 05 November 2008.  Larry, Allison,
Patrick, Jerry, Will, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the specs officially define a <code>Nil</code> type that is the meaning of <code>()</code></li>
<li>an undef that's undef in item context</li>
<li>otherwise, just a null list</li>
<li>just to clarify the semantics of what it means to say <code>return;</code></li>
<li>answered Patrick's email about autothreading of junctions over method calls</li>
<li>I think that doesn't have much impact on specs</li>
<li>we can clarify if necessary</li>
<li>in terms of hackery, I've done a lot of work on cursor and <code>STD</code> and <code>gimme5</code></li>
<li>optimizations and simplifications</li>
<li>preparing to get rid of TRE in the lexer</li>
<li>threw a lot of stuff out of cursors themselves</li>
<li>they no longer track the original string or positional memos in the Perl 5 version</li>
<li>nor do they distinguish a <code>to</code> attribute anymore</li>
<li>an unbound cursor only as a position</li>
<li>a bound cursor has a from</li>
<li>for ratchety kind of matching, all it does is modify the position in a mutable cursor</li>
<li>rather than copying cursors, which is fairly expensive</li>
<li>a little more efficient</li>
<li>made the <code>tryfile</code> syntax checker work on multiple test files</li>
<li>keeps it from having to recompile the standard grammar on every test</li>
<li>it does leak rather badly</li>
<li>you can't parse the entire test suite with one invocation, unless you have a lot of virtual memory</li>
<li>refactoring the various methods which determine cursors to try to make decisions earlier</li>
<li>don't have to make extra function calls to make a decision which should be made at a higher level</li>
<li>some speed gains, some preparation for lexer changes</li>
<li>another preparation is to start emulating NFG semantics</li>
<li>when I set up for the original parse, I now do an <code>unpack "U*"</code> as an emulation of NFG</li>
<li>one integer per character</li>
<li>some of my tests in my regex emulation now test against that array</li>
<li>rather than against the original string</li>
<li>it runs no slower, even accounting for the conversion</li>
<li>eventually the lexing I want to do with a homebrew DFA matcher will use that integer array directly</li>
<li>probably also buys some efficiency</li>
<li>Perl 5 is not very efficient about recalculating positions</li>
<li>it only caches a few UTF-8 positions for a string</li>
<li>if I'm bouncing back and forth between the beginnings and endings of tokens, it has to keep recalculating UTF-8 from one direction or the other</li>
<li>the net NFG will be a win</li>
<li>even if some tests need to use the string version</li>
<li>still planning to get rid of TRE</li>
<li>the workarounds cause the lexer to take half a GB of disk space</li>
<li>hope it'll run faster too</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>worked on exceptions in Parrot</li>
<li>mostly identifying places where the spec needs work, or how they don't work as I expect them</li>
<li>answering questions about the specification</li>
<li>worked on lexical variable handling in Parrot</li>
<li>tomorrow, Jonathan and I will switch over to the new container/value semantics so they work properly</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>does that fix list assignment?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's necessary, but not sufficient</li>
<li>PCT also needs some changes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>worked on some refactoring of Rakudo's action grammar</li>
<li>action methods</li>
<li>there were many different types of calls into the metaobject</li>
<li>it was quite a mess</li>
<li>I implemented an <code>isa</code> method on PCT's <code>Node</code> class</li>
<li>converted Rakudo to use that instead of <code>.WHAT</code> or <code>.HOW.isa</code></li>
<li>definitely more refactoring to do in the action methods</li>
<li>I'll attack that as I can</li>
<li>Jonathan made some changes to Rakudo's <code>use</code></li>
<li>instead of compile time, it happens at <code>INIT</code> time</li>
<li>precompiled modules work now</li>
<li>but it's still a hack</li>
<li><code>use</code> shouldn't be done at <code>INIT</code> time</li>
<li>his changes necessitated changes to my <code>import</code> patch</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that was the case anyway</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I knew that was the case</li>
<li>I just need the time to rework that</li>
<li>still preparing for the Parrot Developer Summit</li>
<li>again, that will continue until after it happens</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>did some Parrot work this week</li>
<li>fixed up the sub-level tracing that's been broken for some of the more complex code</li>
<li>turned out to be a cut-and-paste job from something Jonathan had done for Rakudo in Perl 6</li>
<li>trying to go through the deprecated list, getting rid of some low-hanging fruit</li>
<li>deleted quite a bit of code this week</li>
<li>looking at the tracing stuff to help me figure out where Tcl is spending most of its time</li>
<li>we seem to be invoking PGE a lot</li>
<li>looking forward to some of the work Patrick has on his plate</li>
<li>hopefully that'll get Tcl and Perl 6 running faster</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I fixed some bugs</li>
<li>fixed some crash bugs</li>
<li>found some new crash bugs and fixed them</li>
<li>also trying to remove deprecated code</li>
<li>tracking down some other crash bugs, but they're tricky</li>
<li>cleaning up code is a priority there</li>
<li>still thinking about how to do PIR-level profiling</li>
<li>we sorely need it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the release candidate didn't get out last weekend</li>
<li>still might not get out this weekend</li>
<li>waiting on a CPAN release of File::Path</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>remember that there are two init times</li>
<li>there's the semantics of Perl 6 INIT block</li>
<li>there's the Parrot sub <code>:init</code> as well</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I meant the Perl 6 version</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there's nothing prior to <code>:init</code> in Parrot terms, if you're talking about Parrot</li>
<li>we have to keep that in mind</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Jonathan pushes onto <code>$?INIT</code> in the Perl 6 terms</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it has to happen earlier than that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Larry, what version of Perl are you using, in terms of UTF-8 slowness?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>5.10</li>
<li>it does some caching of pos</li>
<li>but if your lexer runs back and forth to test the same thing various times, it still has to do some stuff</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it ought to be able to store three or more positions</li>
<li>might be as simple as a <code>#define</code></li>
<li>I haven't done that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm moving away from the whole UTF-8 model anyway toward the NFG model</li>
<li>that <code>unpack</code> is amazingly fast</li>
<li>I thought I'd lose some time, but it was just as fast</li>
<li>maybe that's some kind of indication that we're going the right direction</li>
<li>I'm not actually <em>doing</em> NFG, just assuming I'm in NFC form</li>
<li>NFC is a subset of NFG</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>with this approach, will you always need a hybrid solution?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it depends on what your VM is</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we can recommend one for you</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>some things are easier to check in Perl 5 with the string matching</li>
<li>no decent way I know of to ask whether a particular character number matches a particular character class</li>
<li>I'd have to convert it to a string, then do a pattern match against it</li>
<li>as far as I know</li>
<li>unless you're aware of a way in which of saying "Is character #582 an alphanumeric?"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I assume you can hijack UTF-8 swatch caches to figure that out in Perl 5</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it would take an XS hack right now</li>
<li>don't think those are exposed at the integer level</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>part of that is implemented as Perl 5</li>
<li>converted to XS, at least the slowest parts</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I doubt it would be difficult to make an API for direct access in a version of Perl</li>
<li>it wouldn't be in the current version</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>not likely to be sufficiently faster, when you account for developer time</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>essentially, I'm matching against UTF-32</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>do we have a good idea or list of what methods are defined on junctions?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there's probably a secret method name which does the autothreading, which <code>Object</code> delegates to</li>
<li>other than that, maybe some methods to extract out the bits of it</li>
<li>they would not have to be human readable</li>
<li>I'd de-Huffmanize those names to prevent accidentally running into them</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>this came up with regard to any container, not just junctions</li>
<li>how do you call a method on a container, not something that hypers over the values?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's not automatic, as it is with junctions</li>
<li>the method that kept coming up in my mind is <code>.values</code> to grab the values out of the junction</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there'll be a method to do that, but not with that name</li>
<li><code>.junction_values</code></li>
<li>something unlikely to collide with anything else</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there was a discussion about stringification being made special somehow</li>
<li>the printed stringification and default stringification might be different</li>
<li>the <code>.perl</code> method on a junction might return a list of strings, rather than a string</li>
<li>how do we get a string that contains the junction operator in the middle, rather than a junction of two strings</li>
<li>has that made it into Synopses somehow?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>a multimethod which converts a junction to a string will fire directly without autothreading</li>
<li><code>Str(Junction)</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's a method, not a function?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it doesn't really matter, as long as it's defined within <code>Junction</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><code>Junction.Str</code> always gets that version, and does an autothread?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>if a <code>Str</code> method is defined in Junction then it won't autothread</li>
<li>only autothreads if <code>Object</code</code> gets the method dispatch.</li>
<li>always produces a string which looks as if it came from <code>.perl</code></li>
<li>everything falls out of the current mechanism</li>
<li>we don't have to define special cases</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>one more question</li>
<li>what is the syntax for matching a string or object against a specific rule within a grammar?</li>
<li>a lot of people have smart matched against the name of the rule</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>underneath, you create a match</li>
<li>then just call a method on that</li>
<li>the method is the rule</li>
<li>how much syntactic sugar we want to wrap around that, I'm not sure</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>can I tell people that they're doing it wrong?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it probably is, yes</li>
<li>it sounds wrong, without seeing it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>essentially <code>$variable ~~ Gramar::Rule_Name</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that seems unlikely to work without someone deciding to create the match</li>
<li>it's possible the smart match operator could be smart enough to do that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>if I do <code>$variable ~~ sub</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that depends on the arity of the sub</li>
<li>similar distinction</li>
<li>"Oh, this is actually a method"</li>
<li>presumably of zero arity, except for the invocant</li>
<li>essentialy the string has to be passed in as the invocant</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that is one of those things where the smart match is macro-like</li>
<li>it recognizes that it's a sub, not a list operator</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it recognizes a routine of some sort</li>
<li>it needs to know that it's a method from just inspection</li>
<li>just naming a method doesn't give it enough information</li>
<li>unless you put it in method form...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>leave methods out of it for now</li>
<li>does that syntax check the arity of a sub against something</li>
<li>or does it treat it as a list op?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it'll call the sub with the left-hand argument as the first argument</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>as opposed to <code>$variable ~~ &amp;sub</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>normally a sub name in a term position is a listop</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>seems like it still is</li>
<li>I don't think it'll work without the ampersand</li>
<li>you have to allow a general expression on the right to return a value to smart match</li>
<li>you need explicit curlies or the ampersand</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>in the recent past, I remember discussions with the PPI folks that Perl 6 can't parse Perl 6 any better than Perl 5 can parse Perl 5</li>
<li>although things aren't perfect with the parse yet or STD</li>
<li>and we aren't using <code>BEGIN</code> and macros yet</li>
<li>azawawi has created a syntax highlighter based on STD</li>
<li>it's really cool</li>
<li>feather has syntax-highlighted versions of all of the spec tests</li>
<li>they're linked from spec.pugscode.org</li>
<li>you can see syntax-highlighted Perl 6 today</li>
<li>hasn't been reported anywhere</li>
<li>definitely worth mentioning</li>
<li>effectively a built-in</li>
</ul></p>
