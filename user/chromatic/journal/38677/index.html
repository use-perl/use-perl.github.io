<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 18 March 2009.  Larry, Allison, Jerry, Nicholas, Will, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>spent a large part of the past week preparing for Parrot 1.0</li>
<li>making lots of test packages for Ubuntu and Debian</li>
<li>lots of spit and polish finishes before the release</li>
<li>I didn't warn our admins that we'd get a traffic spike</li>
<li>but I didn't expect that either, so I'm pleasantly surprised</li>
<li>will work on the Pynie implementation in the next week</li>
<li>partly because I'm going to Pycon</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>some bugfixes for Parrot</li>
<li>some longer term planning</li>
<li>will write up some thoughts on future Parrot architecture in the near future</li>
<li>otherwise trying to finish the Modern Perl book</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>helped get Parrot 1.0 out</li>
<li>a lot of people chipped in</li>
<li>Allison dedicated a lot of time to it, so she deserves a lot of credit</li>
<li>gave a talk at SPUG last night on Parrot 1.0</li>
<li>well-received</li>
<li>will generate some more interest in local interest</li>
<li>some people asked about writing their own languages</li>
<li>which was the goal of 1.0</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>CJ Collier sent me a positive note about your talk last night</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I think there's a dynamic languages conference at Microsoft in April</li>
<li>I'll find out more details</li>
<li>otherwise, Google accepted TPF for GSoC 2009</li>
<li>just made it public an hour ago</li>
<li>we need people to sign up as mentors</li>
<li>we need ideas</li>
<li>there's a wiki page we can update</li>
<li>http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?gsoc_2009_projects</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>been a busy boy!</li>
<li>junctions are now a native type that you aren't allowed to change the internals of</li>
<li><code>.eigenstates</code> is now a private method</li>
<li>it was too tempting for people to play with</li>
<li>if they want to get at that method, they have to persuade the <code>junction</code> type to trust them</li>
<li>we decided that blocks should not autothread</li>
<li>they should generally be transparent to datatypes which transfer in and out of them</li>
<li>the default parameter to a block is now <code>Object</code> and not <code>Any</code></li>
<li>subroutines and methods take an <code>Any</code>, so they still autothread by default</li>
<li>you can force an autothread by passing an <code>Any</code> as a parameter</li>
<li>lots of little cleanups</li>
<li>no longer an <code>int</code> prefix operator; we have typecasts</li>
<li>it was ambiguous as to whether it expected a following term</li>
<li>general cleanup on other confusing words of that type</li>
<li>we've created a category of syntactic terms which are values: pi, e, enums</li>
<li>they're not 0-ary functions</li>
<li>they don't expect a following term</li>
<li>we're breaking the Perl 5 notion that constants are merely 0-ary functions</li>
<li>typenames already were these singleton values</li>
<li>they were typically undefined protoobjects</li>
<li>now you can declare constants in this category</li>
<li>they're defined but parse the same way as types do</li>
<li>last week we turned the <code>Result</code> object into a hash element <code>.&lt;?&gt;</code></li>
<li>then it was an object attribute, <code>.rob</code></li>
<li>we've noticed that as it's used mostly to create ASTs</li>
<li>now it's available through the accessor <code>.ast</code></li>
<li>I didn't like the term "result object" anyway</li>
<li>S05 uses the term "result" 95% of the time to refer to something else</li>
<li>they're now abstract objects or AST objects</li>
<li>reviewed the IO spec</li>
<li>simplified it massively</li>
<li>fixed many syntax errors and brainos</li>
<li>somewhat cleaner now</li>
<li>decided that the <code>.()</code> for a normal function call was bogus</li>
<li>the dot forms other than that are all a form of dereferencing</li>
<li>on a normal function call, it's syntactic sugar for the bare parens as part of the special form</li>
<li>because it was confusing as to accessor functions, we removed the special dot form</li>
<li>you can still put whitespace with a backslash, but not the dot form</li>
<li><code>.()</code> needs some object which responds to the <code>Callable</code> role</li>
<li>we now have non-sigil constant declarations: <code>constant pi = 3</code></li>
<li>spec'd a while ago, but I never managed to get that into STD</li>
<li>other big effort was to get <code>viv --p6</code> to spit out a perfect copy of <em>STD.pm</em></li>
<li>it's a deparser</li>
<li>I managed to get it to that point, but not always by the correct means</li>
<li>match objects now -- not quite specified yet -- have the notion of accessing the captures in the order of parsing, left to right</li>
<li>makes it very easy to write a translator</li>
<li>you can traverse them in order and translate the ones you want according to type</li>
<li>no need to reconstruct the order of the nodes</li>
<li>this is often useful</li>
<li>makes it easy to process if some of the captures capture multiple things under the same name</li>
<li>choice of accessing by name and by array under that</li>
<li>my next goal is to rewrite <code>gimme5</code> as a Perl 5 emitter using <code>viv</code></li>
<li>then I'll have a real parser which spits out code</li>
<li>looked at some of the tests</li>
<li><em>constant.t</em> had several tests inside hard-wired <code>eval</code>s</li>
<li>they're invisible when I run my standard parsing tests</li>
<li>I took them out</li>
<li>if something isn't parsing there, someone needs to add fudge comments</li>
<li>I wonder how many other <code>eval</code>s hide broken syntax</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's a holdover from the Pugs tests</li>
<li>should be reasonably easy for Moritz and the other folks to catch</li>
<li>it's unusual they didn't catch that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>improved a lot of error messages</li>
<li>I love error messages</li>
<li>if you use the semicolon stub form of a sub or something, it complains about a missing closure</li>
<li>reasonable error messages for extra decimal points</li>
<li>created a bug in heredoc processing by changing the internals of my nibbler</li>
<li>have to pull out the insides of the quoted string to find the closing heredoc terminator</li>
<li>shot myself in the foot on that one</li>
<li>cleaned out a lot of dead wood</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>woohoo on the Parrot release!</li>
<li>woohoo on the Summer of Code!</li>
<li>interested to note that Rakudo's implementation of state variables came after Perl 5's implementation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>been working on This Week in Parrot posts up to the 1.0 release</li>
<li>will do a double-long one next week as I skipped last week</li>
<li>need to get both Tcl and APL working again</li>
<li>ignored those in favor of helping with 1.0</li>
<li>going through the usual ticket mongering and removing deprecated things</li>
<li>that's much more satisfying now that 1.0 is out</li>
<li>and today is Rachael's birthday, so you have to put this in the notes</li>
<li>no singing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>in Perl 5 at work, we've had an ideological battle about <code>use constant</code></li>
<li>which I know the optimizer can inline</li>
<li>and the other is the use of <code>Readonly</code>, which uses tied variables</li>
<li>the XS version flips the <code>READONLY</code> flag</li>
<li>the latter interpolate in strings, even though they're not inlined</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>they interpolate in Perl 6 inside a closure block, <code>"{pi}"</code></li>
<li>not as big an issue if you use the sigil in front</li>
<li>the question is "Does the compiler know about the value?"</li>
<li>that's irrelevant to the sigil in the front</li>
<li>Perl 6's <code>readonly</code> is runtime only</li>
<li>a true constant you can constant fold at compile time</li>
<li>you can't do that with <code>readonly</code>, because it might have a different value next time</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's not necessarily immutable</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>all formal parameters are <code>readonly</code> by default</li>
<li>but they might have different values on the next call</li>
<li>we're distinguishing between <code>constant</code> and <code>readonly</code> in Perl 6</li>
</ul></p>
