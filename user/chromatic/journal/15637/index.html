<p><p>I've not written any fiction in a long time, unless you count expense reports  (joke!) or todo lists (unfortunately not a joke).</p>

<p>Part of my motivation behind the <a href="http://xptrain.perl-cw.com/">Perl XP Training Project</a> is to build a game where I <em>can</em> tell a story.  Sure, it's a hack and slash, but it's a persistent world with characters and conspiracies and plot motion.  It might not turn out as tonally beautiful as Thief or as layered as Babylon 5, but I think I have a couple of good stories in me.</p>

<p>Maybe it's the way I've locked myself in my bedroom for three days, fighting off a cold, but tonight I sat down and plotted out two groups of characters.  Then, just as I should have been reading <em>Quicksilver</em> before falling asleep, I wrote a 1500-word short story set in the universe where I imagine Cyberspace Game to take place.</p>

<p>Even if Neal Stephenson killed cyberpunk in 1992, I think there's still room to examine the human condition through the genre.  Maybe that's especially true because we're a few short steps closer to imagining what the future may be.</p>

<p>Anyway, it's called <a href="http://wgz.org/chromatic/fiction/qualifying.txt">Qualifying</a> and it was fun to write.  At least tomorrow I can blame cold medicine and sleep deprivation for any embarrassing blunders.</p></p>
