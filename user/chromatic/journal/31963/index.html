<p><p>The Perl 6 Design team met via phone on 13 December 2006. Larry, Allison, Patrick,  Nicholas, and chromatic attended. These are the notes.</p>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>mainly working on porting Punie to Patrick's new compiler tools</li>
<li>did some testing and refactoring of the tools yesterday</li>
<li>just a little bit</li>
<li>found that the proposed sequential refactoring c and I discussed will make it easier to test</li>
<li>I'll send that over to Patrick</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>my quick idea was to write little PIR scripts to test each node type</li>
<li>create a tree that exercises that node type</li>
<li>see if it does the right thing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>oh yes</li>
<li>I was testing HLLCompiler</li>
<li>some of the earlier PAST tests will port over</li>
<li>they had basic test</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>my idea was just send a PIR program through</li>
<li>let it create a tree with the node calls</li>
<li>make sure that it compiles and does the right thing when it compiles</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have one complete top-to-bottom example</li>
<li>creates and parses a very simple language</li>
<li>makes the AST</li>
<li>sends that through to the POST</li>
<li>make sure that it prints the result that it expects to print</li>
<li>the only want to get that in right now is the source syntax and the parser grammar and a file for the AST transformation grammar</li>
<li>early on, I had TGE set up to work if you passed in a source string</li>
<li>either I didn't test that adequately, or I'm running into low level Parrot bugs, but I couldn't get that working</li>
<li>it would be a lot easier if we took c's strategy of an array of events to execute</li>
<li>that'll be easier to test</li>
<li>we can break out the pieces then</li>
<li>test only AST -&gt; OST independently, for example</li>
<li>I'll work on that next week</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have a solution for the string issue</li>
<li>create a <code>PAST::Val</code>, but give it a vtype of undef and no ctype</li>
<li>PAST-pm won't do any constant manipulation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>that'll work in the short term</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>things quiet in Pugs lately</li>
<li>fglock has been doing some work though</li>
<li>keeping track of the mailing lists and Perl Monks</li>
<li>mostly just answering questions as they come up</li>
<li>also thinking about the relationship of gather/take with threading</li>
<li>watching the type theory discussions go scrolling by with my eyes glazing over</li>
<li>no real hacking except on the Perl 5 stuff</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>have a paying job with deadlines this week, so not much on Perl 6</li>
<li>did get the <code>try</code> block running</li>
<li>that leaves the <code>for</code> loop and <code>END</code> blocks</li>
<li>I have a solution for binding now, thanks to mdiep</li>
<li>I don't know that I'll have it ready for this Saturday</li>
<li>Saturday's still open for me to partipate in the Parrot Bug Day</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>6 on 5 needed a feature</li>
<li>I figured that you can rid of a scalar type in Perl 5</li>
<li>blead now has a spare type as a placeholder for doing some kind of binding</li>
<li>it's now up to someone else to do a small amount of programming to make this work</li>
<li>doesn't need a fix before 5.10</li>
<li>it can go in later without breaking binary compatibility</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>how much work is it to do it?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I don't know</li>
<li>I don't know what all it needs to do or how to test the corner cases</li>
<li>biggest problem is making read-only aliases to read-write things</li>
<li>read-write aliases are easy: increase the refcount and and stash the pointer</li>
<li>somehow the read-only alias has to make things unaware that it does an alias but think it's read-only</li>
<li>maybe it's as easy as doing all of the read-only logic checking for the alias type and then dereference it</li>
<li>it can croak in the normal way if you try to write it</li>
<li>lots of corner cases in other places</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>does triggering <code>IOK</code> or <code>NOK</code> count as modifying it?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>in the core that's okay already</li>
<li>not sure what else is there</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>submitted patches to get <code>Test::TAP::Model</code> and <code>Test::TAP::HTMLMatrix</code> to work; they're in RT</li>
<li>explored Patrick's ResizablePMCArray subclassing and posted a patch, but it causes failures in <code>Data::Dumper</code></li>
<li>still think it's the right fix though</li>
<li>we're holding the Parrot Bug Day this Saturday</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Saturday what time?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>all day</li>
<li>don't care what time zone</li>
<li>we'll try to have someone knowledgeable there all the time</li>
</ul>
