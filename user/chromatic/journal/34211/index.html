<p><blockquote><em>Perl is almost always used to create Ã¢â¬Åwrite once codeÃ¢â¬Â and therefore ends up not being taken seriously as a modern web app development language...</em></blockquote>

<p>&mdash; Rodney Degracia, <a href="http://elitefrontier.com/wp/2007/08/24/little-cream-soda/">Little Cream Soda</a></p>

<p>For any language in which a reasonably skilled practitioner can distinguish between obfuscated and de-obfuscated code, it's the fault of the programmer if code is unreadable to anyone who actually knows the language.</p>

<p>The readability of a program is meaningless to people who don't know the language.  Likely also the problem domain.</p>

<p>It's time to talk about write-only coders instead of write-only languages--at least if you actually care about quality software rather than having a sneering contest.</p></p>

<p>Yes... but <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2007/08/is_it_time_to_replace_english.html" title="oreillynet.com">I already said that English was too difficult to write correctly</a oreillynet.com>.  Anyway, fixed now, thanks!</p>

If you can't read code that your wrote then don't blame the language blame yourself. Perl gives you a pretty powerful gun. If you take that gun and shoot yourself in the foot that is your fault.

He does make a semi-point about Ruby. Rails is being built into the next version of OSX and the Ruby bridge to Objective-C is supposed to be really good. I don't agree about Ruby in the web space arena because there simple are little to no hosting companies that have Ruby as an option and certainly not RoR.

FWIW, the Perl bridge to Objective-C is also REALLY GOOD. In a way I'm glad it's not going to be shipped with the OS as that way I can update it outside of an official Apple update.<br><br>There's nothing I haven't been able to do with it yet (though like every open source thing, the docs are somewhat lacking).

I did not mean to disparage CamelBones at all. I was only commenting on Ruby. I am firmly in the Perl camp though but haven't gotten around to CamelBones yet. I am assuming CamelBones here as that is the only one that "I" know about.

Yes, I know you didn't. But I'm trying to keep it in the forefront of people's minds as 10.5 comes out talking about scripting language bindings - CamelBones still works, and is a really amazing piece of work.
