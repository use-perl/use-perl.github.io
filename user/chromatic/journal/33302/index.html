<p><p>The Perl 6 Design Team met on 16 May 2007 by phone.  Larry, Damian, Allison, Patrick, Jesse, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.  These are the minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>resting up and feel better</li>
<li>working on the PMC PDD</li>
<li>checked in the first draft, but it still needs some work</li>
<li>spent the weekend reviewing patches and resolving bugs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>anything standing in your way?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>a handful of C developers would be nice</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>released Parrot 0.4.12</li>
<li>didn't get as much coding done as I wanted</li>
<li>it's a solid release though</li>
<li>right now I'm cleaning up some code files</li>
<li>will write up a getting started guide soon though</li>
<li>intended to help people interested in any language to start hacking on Parrot or write languages</li>
<li>send people with questions my way</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>last week's What's Wrong Perl 6 meditation on PerlMonks solicited information</li>
<li>seemed well-intentioned</li>
<li>it did provide a place for people to link to if there are good responses</li>
<li>I tried to respond to the honest questions and ignore the disingenuous ones</li>
<li>more clarifications as requested</li>
<li>seems like I've been answering a lot of questions on IRC about what semantics are explained where</li>
<li>mostly new people trying to come up to speed</li>
<li>we'll have a bunch more once Pugs 6.28 is out and we start getting a compiler bootstrapped in Perl 6</li>
<li>mostly now just doing research and thinking about my talks</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Damian:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>still occupied with family issues</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>checked in a draft of the abc grammar</li>
<li>have some comments and feedback on that</li>
<li>seems to have universal appeal</li>
<li>studied Larry's STD grammar in more detail</li>
<li>expect to have a working implementation of abc using those details by this time next week</li>
<li>also should have a fairly significant start of the Perl 6 grammar too</li>
<li>turns out to be easier than I anticipated</li>
<li>it's exciting</li>
<li>the embedded actions can become a token in PGE</li>
<li>it can execute those actions at runtime</li>
<li>you have a ParseToAST object you pass to the grammar</li>
<li>it'll fire off those actions at runtime</li>
<li>that makes it pluggable</li>
<li>should be straightforward enough that other people can contribute patches</li>
<li>especially with a standard grammar that people can work from</li>
<li>I'll plug rules from that into the existing grammar</li>
<li>goal is to use that grammar outright for everything</li>
<li>I may propose patches to the standard grammar too</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>okay</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>my biggest work at the moment is looking at the bottom-up parser</li>
<li>figuring out how to do something similar in PGE</li>
<li>PGE's parser might be somewhat different</li>
<li>a lot of languages won't need what Perl 6 does</li>
<li>I'll keep a simplified version around for abc, mini Perl 6, etc</li>
<li>it should look pretty good</li>
<li>expect to have something workable by this time next week</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there are certainly bugs in what I've written</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I've found and ignored a few</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there may even be egregious design errors</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll bring them up</li>
<li>having the grammar in full is helpful</li>
<li>seeing contextual variables is a ton of help</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Damian:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's excellent and very exciting</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>now that you have the release out c, are you still looking at Patrick's stuff?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>after I get the "getting started" guide done, I'll look at PGE and parsing and PAST</li>
<li>need to port Pheme to HLLCompiler, for example</li>
<li>intended as better tutorial documentation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm glad to see that</li>
<li>lots of people could use it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the two Perl 6 microgrants seem to be making progress</li>
<li>even if they've been slow the past weeks</li>
<li>we'll try to choose smaller grants next time</li>
<li>maybe more visible progress</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I like the work Steve Peters has done</li>
<li>it's led to some cleanups outside of his patches</li>
<li>I use it as examples for some of my cleanups</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>with Perl 5 state variables, if you clone a closure do you get a clone of the state variable as well?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Rafael knows better</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the correct behavior is that every time you create a clone of the closure, you get a new initialized state variable</li>
<li>if you treat it like a C static, you get the wrong behavior</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I think it's like a <code>my</code> variable in the lexical pad</li>
<li>there was something weird with <code>pp_assign</code> if the rvalue is a function for example</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I just want to make sure there aren't a bunch of broken Perl 5 scripts</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I think it's okay</li>
</ul></p>
