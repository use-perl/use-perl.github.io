<p><p>My secret project of the past week has finally reached a point where I'm ready to share it.  You can now download <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/Games::PMM">Paper Mach&eacute; Monsters</a> from a CPAN mirror near you.  It's not brilliant, featureful, or even particularly fun to play, but I really like the concept, I'm proud of the code, and I think it's four or five features away from being playable.</p>

<p>I cleaned up the line of sight algorithm last night and finished the documentation this afternoon.  Then I spent a couple of hours hacking up a decent SDL display.  It's not on the CPAN yet, but you can grab <a href="http://wgz.org/chromatic/perl/Games-PMM-SDL.tar.gz">Games::PMM::SDL</a> from my site.  You'll need Perl SDL and, probably, a Unixy system.  It needs documentation and a bit of cleanup, especially as I need better graphics than the Gnome icon I borrowed, but it really brings the game to life.</p>

<p>Run the <tt>sdl.pl</tt> program with a commands file.  (It can be as simple as "forward", "turn right".  That's a good test.)  Press ENTER to start and ENTER after every turn.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p></p>

I don't know if that worked, though, as I got to the following error and stopped.</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>[ovid@ovid Games-PMM-SDL]$ perl -Ilib sdl.pl<br>Can't locate auto/SDL/TTFInit.al in @INC (@INC contains: lib<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>SDL installed just fine through the CPAN, but I do wonder if there is something obvious that I'm overlooking.</p>

<p>I was afraid that might happen.  I've installed SDL 2.03 which appears to be available only through CVS from <a href="http://www.sdlperl.org/" title="sdlperl.org">sdlperl.org</a sdlperl.org>.</p>

<p>Dave G&ouml;hrig, the maintainer, went on an extended backpacking trip at the end of October and gave up maintainership, though it appears that no one has taken over for him.  I kinda wish I had time to do that.</p>

<p>Someone should bundle up 2.x and release it to the CPAN or else port my code to use whichever version is on the CPAN already.  Sorry for the mishap!</p>

<p>Actually, <a href="http://bloodgate.com/perl/sdl/sdl_perl.html" title="bloodgate.com">Tels' forked SDL Perl</a bloodgate.com> may do the trick.  It's available for download.</p>

<p>I've e-mailed the SDL Perl list to see if anyone's or working to take over maintainership.  Hopefully someone will do so soon.</p>
