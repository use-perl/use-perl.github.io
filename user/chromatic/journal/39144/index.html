<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 20 May 2009.  Larry, Allison, Patrick, Jerry, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>trying to delegate some of my spec writing</li>
<li>if someone has something that needs to change and that person understands the design principles, someone can go ahead</li>
<li>Moritz respecced <code>each</code> to make it a conjectural junction</li>
<li>other people are working on the NFG specification</li>
<li>I haven't seen any changes committed on that yet</li>
<li>thinking about how importation works</li>
<li>particularly with inlined modules</li>
<li>expect that there will be an <code>import</code> declarator implied by <code>use</code> but usable explicitly</li>
<li>if you say <code>import</code> with an inline module or role declaration, it'll perform the export</li>
<li>which won't happen by default</li>
<li>thinking about how that declaration works at the moment</li>
<li>instead of <code>trait_auxiliary</code> and <code>trait_verb</code>, which fill the same syntactic category, we have <code>trait_mod</code></li>
<li>they all occur in the same spot</li>
<li>you're always looking for them both simultaneously</li>
<li>the hander routines are now all upperclass autocalled, like other handlers</li>
<li><code>IS</code> or <code>TRAIT_IS</code> or <code>APPLY_IS</code>, or some such</li>
<li>still thinking about namespaces for typeless traits not based on classes</li>
<li>perhaps <code>rw</code> or <code>readonly</code> traits aren't types</li>
<li>they need to be in a namespace somewhere</li>
<li>maybe just a syntactic category</li>
<li>added the use of ampersand variables on method calls to STD, <code>.&amp;foo</code></li>
<li>you can already say <code>$.foo</code>, call a code reference as if it were a method</li>
<li><code>&amp;</code> is also a code reference; ought to be allowed there too</li>
<li>Jonathan was playing with ampersand attributes, <code>.&amp;!foo</code></li>
<li>the rudimentary POD parser now complains if you don't have a matching <code>=end</code> for your <code>=begin</code>, except in the case of <code>=begin END</code></li>
<li>if you put a default onto a named parameter, parser assumed it to be a positional parameter</li>
<li>gave a bogus error message</li>
<li>I fixed that</li>
<li>another interesting grammar tweak</li>
<li>defining an <code> infix:&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;</code> and then a signature</li>
<li>if you leave a space out between the name and the signature parentheses, it would misparse</li>
<li>French angles ambiguously hyper parentheses there</li>
<li>I didn't want to require the space there</li>
<li>it's nice that you can write the declaration as if it a were call with the parens</li>
<li>if you're going to hyperoperate on parentheses, you have to use the dot form</li>
<li><code>&gt;&gt;(</code> is now specifically not a hyperoperator within interpolation</li>
<li><code>&gt;&gt;.(</code> is</li>
<li>that seems to be pretty DWIMmy</li>
<li>everything else is cage cleaning and hanging out</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>did not write any posts</li>
<li>will fix that first</li>
<li>mostly worked with others to make these happen</li>
<li>Tene and I ported Rakudo to run in its own HLL namespace instead of Parrot's</li>
<li>caused a 40-50% slowdown in execution time</li>
<li>we know the cause and have a fix before tomorrow's Rakudo release</li>
<li>I'll compare Rakudo's speed to before the switch</li>
<li>want to credit chromatic for any performance optimizations</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I have a 6.5% improvement for all function calls</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we have better error reporting now</li>
<li>can point to the point in your code with the error, rather than some point in generated PIR code</li>
<li>added the ability to define custom operators in Rakudo</li>
<li>infix, prefix, postfix</li>
<li>in select cases also circumfix</li>
<li>we can move even more parts of the builtins to Perl 6 as a Setting</li>
<li>exposed a few other places we need cleanup</li>
<li>Jonathan is working on those</li>
<li>added a variable to PCT which gives the compiler the names of the files it's compiling</li>
<li>improved error reporting there</li>
<li>added an inline PIR construct to NQP to match Rakudo's</li>
<li>added the <code>qx//</code> quoting term</li>
<li>can now run shell commands and capture the output into a variable</li>
<li>answering questions online and taking care of other little things</li>
<li>preparing for tomorrow's release</li>
<li>though it may occur very late tonight</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>mainly release prep this week</li>
<li>lots of ticket review and patch application</li>
<li>submitted an article to Linux Magazine, "Why Parrot is Important"</li>
<li>more high-level than a tutorial</li>
<li>continuing to work on the book</li>
<li>a good week for high-level design discussions</li>
<li>seems like that happens when I have more time to be on IRC</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>an update on smart-match</li>
<li>Paul Fenwick gave the position of a Perl trainer</li>
<li>the design decision of not being able to overload the left side of the smart match bothered him</li>
<li>there's more discussion there</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>optimizing Parrot and Rakudo</li>
<li>finding bottlenecks</li>
<li>fixing many of them</li>
<li>editing the Parrot book</li>
<li>doing a little more design work on nanoparrot</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>how far off are you from letting other people release Rakudo?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the instructions are in the repository</li>
<li>they're straightforward</li>
<li>I could turn it over to Jonathan or Jerry or any number of people with ease</li>
<li>they could just do it</li>
<li>it's basically a <em>Makefile</em> target</li>
<li>you do some prep work, run the target, then upload the tarball to the right places</li>
<li>I stole liberally from how Parrot does things</li>
<li>I can hand it off any time I get tired of making them</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>so the bus number is low</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>any plans to turn it over soon?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>if other folks think it's important, I can do that</li>
<li>I could pick someone at YAPC::NA to do it</li>
<li>the release day is the Hackathon day there</li>
<li>we could just walk a few people through it that day</li>
<li>even if they don't upload the tarball and push the tag</li>
<li>we'll target that for the June release, even if no one else releases an official release</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I've been trying to get the Parrot release bus number above 10</li>
<li>we're close, which is a great place to be</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that was evident, as yesterday's release manager couldn't make it, and Mark Glines picked it up</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>and it was his first release</li>
</ul></p>
