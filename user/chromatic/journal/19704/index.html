<div class="span8">
<p><p>This is the last day of a three-day weekend.  It's always nice when a federal holiday falls on a weekend, as enlightened employers tend to make the Monday or Friday a holiday to make up for things.  In one sense, I really should be finishing the book before OSCON, but in another sense I'll be a better editor having taken several days off to rest and recuperate.</p>

<p>Instead of working on the book, I did some hacking.  The more I use <a href="http://maypole.simon-cozens.org/">Maypole</a>, the more I like it.  Part of the benefit is familiarity.  It's fairly easy to do simple things, but difficult things aren't that difficult when you understand how things work.</p>

<p>For example, I'm having great success with my article manager database.  It's even more practical now that I added an alternate view template that fills in a contract for the author.  Filling in the fields manually isn't time-consuming, but it surely is tedious.  Now it's just a click away.</p>

<p>Of course, I don't particularly want to run a web server loaded with little db-backed applications all of the time; I'd rather launch a program when I need it, fiddle around a little bit, and close it when I'm done.  That's doubly-true when I'm on the go with my laptop.</p>

<p>That was originally the theory behind <a href="http://wgz.org/chromatic/jellybean/">Jellybean</a>, anyhow.  I'm easily distracted though and had several other projects demand my attention.  Still, the basic idea is solid and the program works.</p>

<p>For kicks, I wrote <a href="http://wgz.org/chromatic/perl/Jellybean-Container-Maypole.tar.gz">Jellybean::Container::Maypole</a> to run Maypole apps under Jellybean.  Maypole's installer doesn't quite like this, as it still assumes you're using Apache and mod_perl.  It works, though, so I can run <tt>article_manager</tt> to launch a dedicated web server and a new tab in my browser and go about my business.  Add in <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> to make something really powerful.</p></p>

What book are you trying to get done for OSCON?

Looks cool, I'll have to check it out.
