<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 21 November 2007.  Allison, Patrick, Will, Nicholas, Jesse, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>lots of parrots in Capetown</li>
<li>finished off a rewrite of the concurrency PDD</li>
<li>there are still a few missing bits, but it's mainly there</li>
<li>going through some of the object tickets and cleaning them out</li>
<li>there were bugs and issues with the old object model that aren't problems now because we were aware of them when we wrote the new one</li>
<li>others were just bugs in the old implementation</li>
<li>my next thing is working on the Events implementation</li>
<li>there's not really much of anything to do here except hack on Parrot and watch Afrikaans soap operas</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>things are going extremely well</li>
<li>should have finished the report last week, but it's on my agenda now</li>
<li>the AST implementation is coming along nicely</li>
<li>should fold that back into the trunk in an hour or so</li>
<li>it has all of the support we need for optional, named, slurpy, and those various parameters</li>
<li>it's much cleaner</li>
<li>saved about 250 or 300 lines of source code in the process</li>
<li>it took a while to get there, but it's going along well since the weekend</li>
<li>also supports namespaces</li>
<li>NQP will be sophisticated enough to interact with objects, including objects written in languages other than NQP</li>
<li>should happen in the next 24 hours</li>
<li>when it's far enough along to do that, it's time to refactor the Perl 6 compiler</li>
<li>that's my plan for the weekend</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>released Parrot 0.5.0</li>
<li>fixed a handful of bugs</li>
<li>tried to fix up as many of languages/ as I can</li>
<li>Pheme, Perl 6, Punie all worked fine</li>
<li>plenty of other bitrot in <em>languages/</em> with PDD 15, but we can clear that up for the next release</li>
<li>I do want to experiment by writing a new GC with a different algorithm sometime</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's basically the state of Parrot this week</li>
<li>once Patrick merges in the PCT branch, I'll go through APL and maybe Tcl and see if there are cleanups</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>APL looked pretty good last night, especially compared to other languages</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'd like to get our languages tests passing in the same way that we keep our normal tests running</li>
<li>Colin's working on the infrastructure to make that work</li>
<li>but we need maintainers to keep the languages up to date</li>
<li>I hope to work on BASIC this weekend</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>how many microgrants remain empty and how many are done?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we have five empty slots without qualified entries</li>
<li>the Pugs folks don't seem to want to take money, even token money</li>
<li>Parrot seems to be covered under larger grants</li>
<li>we'd love to hand out more money</li>
<li>the packaging and documentation ideas never panned out</li>
</ul></p>
