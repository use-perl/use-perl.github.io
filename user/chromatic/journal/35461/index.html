<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 16 January 2008.  Larry, Patrick, Jerry, Jesse, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>fixed a couple of nasty bugs in Parrot</li>
<li>have two more to look at, but I'm working on those</li>
<li>did some more work on the PMC PDD; not sure how much is left</li>
<li>a couple of big tasks, I think</li>
<li>we'll see what's going on there</li>
<li>Allison dishes out a task at a time to me and that works out pretty well</li>
<li>worked with Andy to fix up some const goodness through Parrot</li>
<li>should help memory use on servers and in fakecutables</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we're on our way home from the hospital now, fortunately</li>
<li>have just changed the name of the compiler to Rakudo</li>
<li>happy about that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>what's your sense of handing off things to other people?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>haven't thought much about that</li>
<li>much easier to plan the schedule as we're going home now</li>
<li>it would help with others (Jerry) came up with priorities</li>
<li>things to do or look at next</li>
<li>I can set the priorities on those</li>
<li>most of those someone else can do</li>
<li>comfortable with what Jerry's checking in and coordinating</li>
<li>if there's anything blocking on me, I'll see what I can do</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>works for me</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm online frequently and can answer emails to get important things out of the way</li>
<li>I follow what's checked in and jump in when necessary</li>
<li>we can fix things later if there's something I don't like but don't have time to talk about</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>has Flavio been around?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I haven't seen him</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>things are going well here</li>
<li>added a couple of variant flags for substitutions</li>
<li>attempt to maintain case or accents across substitutions</li>
<li>put a lot of thought and some spec work into the implications of taking the default view to be graphemes</li>
<li>it's a similar problem to the rest of Unicode</li>
<li>you're always running into variable-length encodings</li>
<li>graphemes are, at the very heart of them, variable-length if they don't have a precomposed codepoint</li>
<li>figured I needed to tackle them head-on</li>
<li>within a Perl 6 process, every grapheme that it has seen gets a unique ID</li>
<li>either the precomposed codepoint, if it has one</li>
<li>or a uniquely-assigned ID through the life of the process</li>
<li>we can do things on the grapheme level and not worry about the variable-length encodings</li>
<li>just worry about the maximum int size required</li>
<li>simplifies the functions <code>chr</code> and <code>ord</code></li>
<li>looks like a real win to me</li>
<li>unless someone tries to feed all of the possible graphemes to a single process</li>
<li>could be a denial-of-service I suppose</li>
<li>some discussion about the nature of feed operators and whether they're operators</li>
<li>not much resolution</li>
<li>after much discussion, I wrote a preprocessor to handle tests on a platform-specific basis</li>
<li>called <code>fudge</code>, probably short for "FUD Generator"</li>
<li>interprets smart comments and fudges the tests to pass or todo or skip in a clean way</li>
<li>added benefit that it's a notation that should simply disappear as a platform can pass the tests</li>
<li>you only need to fudge the test if your platform is not yet up to stuff in some way</li>
<li>part of the definition of passing the test is the ability to pass the test without doing any fudging</li>
<li>just trying to stitch the preprocessor into the test harness</li>
<li>or the F<Makefile> for the test process</li>
<li>probably just a filter that fudges the files and passes the fudged files into the harness</li>
<li>answering questions for people working on the other backends for kp6</li>
<li>some activity on both the smop backend (C-based CPS VM) and a possible Ruby backend</li>
<li>also gently pushing Patrick to pick a name, and I'm happy with the result</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>talked with Larry on fudge</li>
<li>nice piece of syntactic sugar</li>
<li>it'll work great as a filter</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>either Test::Harness has to do that</li>
<li>or a source filter within the F<Test.pm> in the script</li>
<li>no spec for source filtering within Perl 6 now, if ever</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>coordinating the infrastructure for Rakudo</li>
<li>includes and IRC channel and some such</li>
<li>gives us a place to talk about that implementation in specific</li>
<li>rather than hammering #parrot with specific questions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>#perl6 expressed an interest in discussing it there</li>
<li>doesn't seem like a good reason to segregate things further</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>hm, we can do that</li>
<li>we just need a wiki and a website</li>
<li>Andy's working that out with Patrick</li>
<li>added a bunch of command-line options and wrote about them in my journal</li>
<li>added support for compiler directives</li>
<li>should be able to remove once fudge is working with Rakudo</li>
<li>added TODO support to the Rakudo test module</li>
<li>we have one or more contributors helping to refactor the Perl 6 test suite</li>
<li>based on that work, I've been able to take a crack at some of the ops and methods that those files test</li>
<li>extending Perl 6</li>
<li>it's been helpful and I hope it continues</li>
<li>lack of direct access to Patrick has slowed me a little, but there's enough to do that it's not bad</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>released a snapshot for 5.8.9 to be</li>
<li>hope to get that out before 5.10.1</li>
<li>I like the new name</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>had a nice chat with Patrick about his work and kp6 and such</li>
<li>talked to Patrick and Flavio about a weekly Perl 6 implementors sketch</li>
<li>they're both interested</li>
<li>we'll work out a set of likely times from the implementors and go from there</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Larry's idea for grapheme IDs sounds like immediately transcoding to UCS-2</li>
<li>or am I making that up?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you can't transcode a grapheme to a fixed-width encoding</li>
<li>they can have an arbitrary number of trailing combining characters</li>
<li>the idea is to get a fixed-width encoding</li>
<li>you already use the one in Unicode, if it exists</li>
<li>the ID of a capital A in Unicode is 65</li>
<li>you just give temporary precomposed forms to those that don't have them</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you design a barrier around input/output</li>
<li>across that barrier, you transcode to Unicode</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you cannot have an output of graphemes</li>
<li>you need some encoding and known normalization</li>
<li>as soon as you transit from grapheme to codepoint, you need to know the mapping</li>
<li>same with encoding</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there seems to be an internal translation</li>
<li>Unicode could generate sequences of combining characters</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>anything that can concatenate codepoints has to look for that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Simon Cozens is looking into this for Parrot</li>
<li>he and Larry should discuss this, because he knows more about this than us</li>
<li>by "us" I mean "me"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>someone proposed named parameter syntax for Perl 5.12</li>
<li>seems sensible to adopt as much of Perl 6 syntax as possible</li>
<li>Larry, have you looked at that thread yet?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>such threads tend to raise my blood pressure</li>
<li>if people are interested in knowing what Perl 6 does, they can go look</li>
<li>I don't have enough bandwidth to keep Perl 5 on track and do my best work on Perl 6</li>
<li>when I do participate, I'm often ignored</li>
<li>see the <code>grep</code>/<code>map</code> in void context thread</li>
<li>propogate the context into the block, and let I<that> complain</li>
<li>you don't get any false positives that way, and no false negatives</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I wonder if we could con Damian into p5p for that discussion</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I doubt it</li>
</ul></p>
