<p><p>I've been out of the hacking saddle for several weeks.  That was rather annoying, as I spent a week at the office last month; there's not much to do in Sebastopol <em>besides</em> programming.</p>

<p>It's not that I lack for things to do, by no means!</p>

<p>Tonight, I broke the dry spell by hacking on <a href="http://wgz.org/chromatic/Jellybean/">Jellybean</a> again.  The latest code in CVS now supports CGI.  That's right, you can run (currently very simple) programs that expect to be run from a standard web server.  That's quite handy if you cannot or don't want to install a bigger web server, or if you want to distribute a program and don't want to mangle it to run under Jellybean natively.
</p>

<p>The previous version (from a couple of years ago) used a somewhat-clever and somewhat-nasty piping scheme that went to a great deal of work to be as cross-platform as it was.  This time, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/IPC::Run/">IPC::Run</a> is a treat.</p>

<p>Along the way, I had to install several modules that weren't yet installed on the Linux partition of my laptop.  The good news is that the LWP tests all pass.  The bad news is that I'd forgotten to stick my laptop's hostname in <code>/etc/hosts</code>, so I spent a few minutes thinking that LWP had suddenly somehow broken.  Oops.</p></p>
