<p><blockquote><p><em>Whatever the merits of certification, it has always been a big hit among those who get to do the certifying.</em></p>

<p><em>Though the rationale for certification is always societal good, the real objective is different: siezure of power. Certification is not something we implement for the benefit of the society but for the benefit of the certifiers.</em></p>

<p><em>But the real issue here is not certification; the real issue is de-certification. Certain people are going to be kicked out of the fold, not because they are not useful to the needs of the market, but because they don't jump through the certifiers' hoops.</em></p></blockquote>

Are you for or against it? I don't care really. I would do it just to have a nice piece of paper to hang in my dreary cube.

As usual, Reg Braithwaite has
<a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/07/certification-bring-it-on.html" title="raganwald.com">something pithy to say on this subject</a raganwald.com>.

Could you fix the Tim Maher link, it currently points to the "Perl is not a toll road" post.<br><br>Honestly Brian, how hard is it to do a bit of link checking? You had no way of verifying it?<br><br>Ahem.  I'm totally kidding<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

Getting the right links seems to be one of my biggest problems in posts. Since it's a comment I can't fix it (at least not myself), but the link I meant was <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=04/01/10/0055227&amp;mode=flat&amp;tid=9" title="perl.org">TPJ Article on Perl Certification Available for Download</a perl.org> by Tim Maher.<br><br>Thanks for the correction.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>Old, but good</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/btilly/">btilly</a> on 2008-01-04T08:36:39</h3>
Look at the date.  It was written a decade ago.  (Hence the Y2K reference in the letter.)



<h2>Gosh! I agree with chromatic :-)</h2>

<p>Certification - waste of space. See <a href="http://del.icio.us/adrianh/certification" title="del.icio.us">my delicious links on certification</a del.icio.us> for a collection of similar views.</p>

<p>I especially enjoy the <a href="http://www.agilealliance.org/show/1796" title="agilealliance.org">Agile Allience position on certification</a agilealliance.org>.</p> <p><blockquote> <div><p> Certifications such as Certified Scrum Master and DSDM Foundation are knowledge-based and easy to achieve. We believe the courses that lead to them are good ones. We believe people who attend them get their money&#8217;s worth. But while the certifications may be evidence of good faith, useful knowledge, and a desire to learn, they are not in themselves evidence of skill</p></div> </blockquote>

<p>I didn't express any opinion in the original post, except that I think that Tom DeMarco wrote that letter.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, I could support a certification that identified actual skill, limited its promises to what it could reasonably support, and did not exclude people of the appropriate and corresponding skills.</p>
