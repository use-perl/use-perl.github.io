<h2>How does that make you a home owner?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2004-07-09T05:09:46</h3>
I like the Gladware things, a roll of masking tape, and a sharpee pen.  It works well for the various jars of soup stock I keep around too.<br> <br>print "Just another lowly renter, "; #<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>That's my current solution as well.  I'd like to skip a couple of steps (finding the masking tape, tearing off a piece, affixing it, dealing with frozen detached masking tape, tearing it off when I've finished using the container).</p>

<p>I suppose it's evidence that I've become somewhat domesticated in my "I own it, so no one else will clean it up for me" state of mind.</p>

<p>I wouldn't be without my <a href="http://www.dymo.com/media/templates/products/generic_product.jhtml?id=LetraTagXREurope&amp;catId=Home_en_UK&amp;navCount=1&amp;navAction=push" title="dymo.com">Dymo Label Gun</a dymo.com>.  Labels food containers just as well as rack mounted servers.</p>

<h2>Crayola Washable Markers?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/derby/">derby</a> on 2004-07-09T12:42:44</h3>
I haven't tried them for this application but they are a snap to clean up when my toddler draws where she shouldn't.



<h2>Hmmm...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chaoticset/">chaoticset</a> on 2004-07-09T15:50:30</h3>
...I wonder if a thin layer of melamine on the outside, sort of a 'permanent label', would be able to be wiped-off like a whiteboard.
<p>
Actually, now that I think of it, I almost think the Anchor Hocking storage stuff is melamine.  If it is, whiteboard markers would work like magic on it.  I'll have to check that out.</p>



<h2>Baggies</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/VSarkiss/">VSarkiss</a> on 2004-07-09T17:21:58</h3>
<p>I only use containers for the fridge, stuff that I would toss if it stayed more than a week anyway.</p>
<p>For things I put in the freezer I use baggies and write on them with a Sharpie.  I do use up a lot of baggies that way, though.</p>

<p>How do you remember what's more than a week old?  That's <em>seriously</em> past the boundary of my attention span for fridge items.</p>
