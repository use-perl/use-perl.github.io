<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 04 February 2009.  Larry, Jerry, Will, Patrick, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>successful migration of the Subversion repository to svn.parrot.org</li>
<li>took up chromatic's ticket challenge and closed a handful a day, applying patches, fixing bugs, clearing out some old TODOs that don't fit with current architecture</li>
<li>started, completed, and merged in the second string refactor branch, a large-scale function name cleanup</li>
<li>a few fixes on the POD parser, mostly handed it off to kj</li>
<li>updated the <a href="https://launchpad.net/user/parrot-dev/+archive/ppa">Parrot Ubuntu packages on the PPA with instructions for using it</a></li>
<li>speaking about Parrot at IBM tomorrow</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>enjoyed the lively discussion with mtnviewmark, timtoady, and others about metaops</li>
<li>really like where that ended up</li>
<li>Jonathan should be making some rakudo commits shortly to clean up the cross metaop spectest failures</li>
<li>thanks to Larry's comments, i'm polishing S19</li>
<li>haven't had much uninterrupted time lately, so progress has been slower than I like</li>
<li>keep thinking that's going to clear up soon... but that hasn't been</li>
the case for weeks now
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>completely revamped <em>STD.pm</em>'s metatoken parsing</li>
<li>treating generated metaoperators as longest tokens did not scale</li>
<li>chasing the implications of that through</li>
<li>LTM occurs on the metaoperator itself separately from the base operator</li>
<li>(most of the base operators are infixes)</li>
<li>what it modifies gets parses as a separate token</li>
<li>has implications on the order you check things</li>
<li><code>!=</code> isn't a separate token</li>
<li>has to be parsed with the combination of the <code>!</code> metaoperator</li>
<li>cuts the number of tokens way down</li>
<li>the lexer runs a fair bit faster</li>
<li>invented a new notation for disambiguating infix operators</li>
<li>they may now all be put in <code>[]</code>, the same form as reduce operators</li>
<li>internal to a metasequence (need a new name for that) sometimes need to identify which operator to apply in which order</li>
<li><code>&amp;[]</code> now refers to the infix function itself</li>
<li>makes it easy to pass binary operators into various functional programming primitives</li>
<li>reduce operator still stays out in front with square brackets</li>
<li>just generalized the notation</li>
<li>made more comments on S19</li>
<li>moving away from the notion of a Prelude</li>
<li>provisionally now called a Setting</li>
<li>it implies things before and after the text of a program</li>
<li>the <code>-n</code> and <code>-p</code> loops put a scope around the scope of your file</li>
<li>invented several new pseudo-package name prefixes to refer to the Setting</li>
<li><code>PERL</code> is the outermost setting as well as <code>LANG</code> for  the sublanguage the file is actually parsed in (such as from <code>-n</code> or <code>-p</code>)</li>
<li>just changed the Prelude to the Setting option in S19</li>
<li>chopped out the old, non-trie lexer since we're not using it</li>
<li>thought it might clean up the looks of the LTM for anyone interested in implementing his own</li>
<li>not that mine is a parallel matcher yet....</li>
<li>still something I'd like to do</li>
<li>maybe I won't have to</li>
<li>working with Mark on revisions to the new metaops (old minus metaops from last week)</li>
<li>many binary operators could use a metaop which reverses their arguments</li>
<li>would have the same effect on comparison operators as reversing the sense of the test</li>
<li>mutated into a <code>R</code> operator</li>
<li>and the <code>X</code> operator lost its second <code>X</code> to work the same</li>
<li>started a trend: adding more metaoperators with a prefix capital letter is a good approach</li>
<li>might end up with <code>Z</code> for a <code>zip with</code> operation</li>
<li>working on moving some of the preludey/settings stuff out of <em>STD.pm</em> into a separate file</li>
     - working over the various symbol tables to do lexical scoping more sanely
     - this is prep work for parsing a real Setting file and dumping out the symbols such that they can be slurped in for the user's file compilation
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>minor station keeping on Parrot</li>
<li>no major progress on cleaning up deprecated stuff</li>
<li>hope to release a copy of This Week in Parrot</li>
<li>trying to resurrect that</li>
<li>lots of questions in IRC about why things are happening</li>
<li>we don't have a good way to answer that</li>
<li>will try to post short articles on front page of parrot.org</li>
<li>hope to do so every Sunday until at least 1.0</li>
<li>then hope to hand it off to someone else</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>moved Rakudo out of the Parrot repository</li>
<li>its official location is github</li>
<li>the old Rakudo stuff is still in the Parrot repository</li>
<li>it'll be gone tomorrow</li>
<li>decided on Git because there weren't many pros for sticking with Subversion</li>
<li>getting everyone up to speed on using Git isn't super easy</li>
<li>haven't run into any major blockers yet either</li>
<li>usually just reorienting ourself to different commands</li>
<li>hacked up a new Configure.pl for Rakudo out of the Parrot tree</li>
<li>making it work with an installed Parrot</li>
<li>Parrot isn't quite there yet</li>
<li>if someone doesn't have Parrot but downloads Rakudo, what's the best way to get them an appropriate revision of Parrot to run on?</li>
<li>looking at options for that</li>
<li>very pleased to see Larry's changes to metaops and other pieces</li>
<li>pleased that Prelude is now Setting</li>
<li>equally pleased that I haven't worked on any of these pieces yet....</li>
<li>hooray for delayed binding</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Alan Kay is smiling somewhere</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>late binding wins again!</li>
<li>laziness is paying off</li>
<li>Rakudo is close to having its own Setting written in Perl 6</li>
<li>part of the repository</li>
<li>probably won't happen by Frozen Perl this weekend</li>
<li>have some documentation to write for that</li>
<li>should have it by the next Rakudo release, sometime in February</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>finishing the draft Parrot support policy</li>
<li>pretty aggressive, but what we discussed at PDS</li>
<li>will be in the repository today</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>what's the schedule on Rakudo releases?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I expect that they'll occur timed with Parrot releases</li>
<li>but not simultaneous</li>
<li>Parrot releases on the third Tuesday</li>
<li>Rakudo will release the weekend after that</li>
<li>this'll give us time to tie it to that specific release</li>
<li>we'll continue the monthly release cycle</li>
<li>for most of 2009, I expect many people won't want to play with the released version of Rakudo</li>
<li>they'll want to play with the head version</li>
<li>all of the cool features and bugfixes</li>
<li>it'll track Parrot, but not necessarily Parrot's head</li>
<li>it'll make sure you have a sufficient version of Parrot, but not necessarily the latest one</li>
<li>January has shown that when Rakudo and Parrot are separated, changes to Parrot trunk can easily break Rakudo</li>
<li>we update a file in the repository now</li>
<li>we'll update that whenever something happens in Parrot that we need to update it with</li>
<li>that version will always include at least a Parrot monthly release</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Parrot's starting to get to the point of Perl 5</li>
<li>changes can break CPAN modules</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we need to be more aggressive about adding those tests to the core test suite</li>
</ul></p>
