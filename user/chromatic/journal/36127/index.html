<p><p>I like optimizing code.  Yesterday, Patrick asked me if I could improve the build time for Rakudo.  I pulled out my trusty Callgrind and profiled the single largest component in the build process.  25 minutes later (Callgrind is accurate, but not speedy -- parallelization please!) I had my data.</p>

<p>This particular hippo is a build stage that turns a file of NQP parse actions into PIR code.  The input file is almost 2000 lines long, and the output file is just over 10,000 lines.  It takes a while to process.</p>

<p>40% of the runtime is garbage collection.  This is one reason we need a better GC, and I'm hopeful that we'll get one as part of the Google Summer of Code.</p>

<p>Of course, one way to make garbage collection cheaper in the short term is to use fewer GCable entities.  One of the most expensive C-level operations during the build (outside of the garbage collector) was the <code>isa</code> vtable entry for the Class PMC.  I've long suspected that this was somewhat inefficient, and I wanted to revise it.  I had the opportunity this afternoon.</p>

<p>This entry takes a string and checks that the current class is or inherits from a class of the same name as the string.  The previous (slower) incarnation created a new instance of a Class from the string and delegated to another vtable entry which performed the same action on classes.</p>

<p>I suspected that the overhead of creating a new GCable element (the Class PMC) and delegating was solvable.  I replaced that delegation with a handful of lines of code which perform string comparisons instead.  After a couple of tweaks, the test suite all passed again.</p>

<p>I profiled the build again.  20 minutes later, Callgrind showed me a 20% performance improvement.  The <code>isa</code> call was somewhat faster (it's not easy to compare, with the delegation in place), but the GC pressure was much less.</p>

<p>The Rakudo test suite is also about 25% faster, so many other things in Parrot benefit from this optimization.</p></p>
