<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 24 February 2010.  Larry, Allison, Patrick, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>my work last week was almost entirely responsive to various discussions on irc and p6l, even when it doesn't seem like it</li>
<li>clarified that <code>LEAVE</code>-style phasers do not trip till after an exception is handled (and not resumed)</li>
<li>the implementation of take is specifically <em>before</em> unwinding even if implemented with a control exception</li>
<li>simplified series operator by moving generator function to the left side (any function on right side will now be a limiting conditional)</li>
<li>a <code>*</code> is no longer required to intuit the series on the left; the absence of generator before the <code>...</code> operator is sufficient</li>
<li>first argument on the right of <code>...</code> is now always a limiter argument</li>
<li>for convenience and consistency, added a new <code>...^</code> form to exclude a literal limiter from the generated series</li>
<li>unlike ranges, however, there is no leading exclusion <code>^...</code> or <code>^...^</code></li>
<li>series is a list associative list infix, and each <code>...</code> pays attention only the portion of the list immediately to its left (plus the limit from the right)</li>
<li>an "impossible" limit can terminate a monotonic intuited series even if the limit can never match exactly</li>
<li>variables now default to a type of <code>Any</code>, and must explicitly declare <code>Mu</code> or <code>Junction</code> type to hold junctions</li>
<li>this is to reduce pressure to duplicate many functions like <code>==</code> with <code>Mu</code> arguments; most of our failure values should be derived from Any in any case</li>
<li>a <code>Mu</code> result is more indicative of a major malfunction now, and is caught at first assignment to an <code>Any</code> variable</li>
<li><code>Instant</code>/<code>Duration</code> types are biased away from <code>Num</code> and towards <code>Rat</code>/<code>FatRat</code> semantics</li>
<li><code>Instant</code> is now completely opaque; we no longer pretend to be the same as TAI, numerically speaking</li>
<li><code>Instant</code>s are now considered a more basic type than epochs, which are just particular named instants</li>
<li>all culturally aware time can be based on calculations involving instants and durations</li>
<li>list associative operators now treat non-matching op names as non-associative rather than right-associative, forcing parens</li>
<li><code>Whatever</code> semantics now autocurry any prefix, postfix, or infix operator that doesn't explicitly declare that it handles whateverness itself</li>
<li><code>WhateverCode</code> objects now take a signature to keep clear how many args are not yet curried</li>
<li>so <code>*+*</code> is now more like <code>WhateverCode:($x,$y)</code></li>
<li>autocurrying is still transitive so multiple ops can curry themselves around a <code>*</code></li>
<li>added semilists as <code>Slicel</code> type to go with <code>Parcel</code></li>
<li>this allows us to bind <code>@array[1,2,3]</code> differently from <code>@array[1,2,3;4,5,6]</code>, for instance</li>
<li>the <code>Matcher</code> type now excludes <code>Bool</code> arguments to prevent accidental binding to outer <code>$_</code> when closure is needed</li>
<li><code>when</code> and <code>~~</code> will now warn of always/never matching on direct use of <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> names as matcher</li>
<li>STD generalizes <code>\w</code> lookahead to all twigils now</li>
<li>STD now treats non-matching list associatives as non-associative</li>
<li>things like <code>1 min 2 max 3</code> are now illegal, and require parenthesization for clarity</li>
<li>STD now treat invocant colon as just a comma variant so it does not fall afoul of the list associativity change</li>
<li>CORE now recognizes the <code>TrigBase</code> enumeration</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>first release of the new branch of Rakudo last week</li>
<li>passing ~25,000 tests at the release</li>
<li>thanks to optimizations from chromatic, Jonathan, and Vasily, Rakudo has a lot of speed improvements</li>
<li>in particular, it can run those tests in under 10 minutes, non-parallel, depending on your hardware</li>
<li>older releases took 25 minutes and more</li>
<li>the regex tests will slow things down</li>
<li>ultimately, we're seeing a big speed improvement over the past releases</li>
<li>cleaned up lists and slices, now they work pretty well</li>
<li>worked with Solomon Foster and others to speed up trig operations</li>
<li>fixed a bug related to lexicals declared in classes</li>
<li>fixed the long-standing and often recurring problem with curlies ending a line/statement causing the next statement to be a statement modifier</li>
<li>easy to fix in the new grammar</li>
<li>that was nice</li>
<li>made an initial implementation of the <code>sort</code> method</li>
<li>it's very short, because Parrot provides one</li>
<li>there are a few bugs in Rakudo there still, but I'll get them</li>
<li>planning for the Copenhagen hackathon on March 5 - 9</li>
<li>Jonathan and I have been updating the Rakudo roadmap</li>
<li>will check that in in the next couple of hours</li>
<li>so far, every time we review it, we surprise ourselves at how much we've accomplished</li>
<li>we're meeting all of the top priority goals without making any heroic efforts</li>
<li>we'll put those goals in as well as timelines</li>
<li>most of the major tasks from previous roadmaps have happened</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>working on Python this week</li>
<li>attended Python VM summit, Python language summit, and PyCon</li>
<li>Parrot's on good track to support what Python needs</li>
<li>useful to make community connections</li>
<li>when I reviewed Pynie, I was surprised to see how close it is to supporting the whole Python syntax</li>
<li>some of those features are big, like objects</li>
<li>but we should support them soon</li>
<li>Debian packages delayed by the absence of a sponsor</li>
<li>they should go into Debian soon though</li>
<li>I put in a request for feature-freeze exception for Ubuntu 10.4</li>
<li>Parrot 2.0 should go in</li>
<li>haven't made any commits to the PCC branch</li>
<li>that'll be a top priority for next week</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>fixed a Parrot GC bug for last week's Rakudo release</li>
<li>made some optimizations in Rakudo and Parrot</li>
<li>helped Jonathan find a few more</li>
<li>fixed a long-standing math MMD bug</li>
<li>still working on HLL subclassing; more tricky than you think</li>
<li>may be some conflicting design goals about vtable overriding and MMD</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Patrick, do we need an explicit deprecation for old PGE and NQP?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I think Will already added one for NQP</li>
<li>we can add one for PGE if we need</li>
<li>they don't necessarily have to disappear at the next release</li>
<li>but no one's planning to maintain them</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>no reason not to put in the notice now</li>
<li>we don't have to remove them at the earliest possible date</li>
</ul></p>
