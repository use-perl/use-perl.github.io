<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 01 October 2008.  Larry, Patrick, Jerry, Jesse, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>busy as usual</li>
<li>did some hacking and a bit of spec work</li>
<li>defining how assignment operators behave when the left side is a protoobject</li>
<li>took out the curly stars at the end of rules a few weeks ago</li>
<li>put in the correct semantics</li>
<li>calls a reduction with the current tag now</li>
<li>don't need an action now</li>
<li>broke macro parsing</li>
<li>you can't define and parse factorial now there</li>
<li>going to the University of Illinois tomorrow</li>
<li>an ACM conference: Reflection/Projection</li>
<li>giving a keynote on Friday night</li>
<li>a workshop on Saturday</li>
<li>that's more or less my standard parser talk</li>
<li>my keynote is the Studies in the Ballistic Arts talk</li>
<li>slightly more general interest</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>did you say that recent changes should make it easier to parse more Perl 6 in Perl 5?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it should make it easier to translate more of <code>gimme5</code> with a Perl 6 parser not a custom parser</li>
<li>should make it easier to parse more Perl 6 into the corresponding Perl 5</li>
<li>then I can rewrite <code>cursor</code> from Perl 5 into Perl 6, and backtranslate it to whatever engine</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>not a lot of coding</li>
<li>lots of helping others code</li>
<li>getting a lot of things done</li>
<li>fixed some Parrot issues out of the way</li>
<li>chromatic fixed floating point constants</li>
<li>lots of spec tests passing</li>
<li>close to 800 new ones in the past week</li>
<li>20% in just one week</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>how much more spec are they covering?</li>
<li>how much is it checking addition of pairs of numbers?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>some broken features now work</li>
<li>many of them are that Moritz and friends have found passing tests in the whole suite and included them in our suite</li>
<li>some are new features</li>
<li>it's a pretty good mix</li>
<li>there's little addition of tests for existing features</li>
<li>lots of tests for features we didn't test yet</li>
<li>Stephen Weeks implemented loop control exceptions in PCT</li>
<li>also for Cardinal</li>
<li>that was this morning</li>
<li>we're looking at those exceptions in general</li>
<li>we want to handle them in a sane manner in Parrot</li>
<li>otherwise, just asking design questions</li>
<li>answering questions on IRC</li>
<li>lots of thinking about fixing reference and value types in Rakduo</li>
<li>trying to get momentum in my head to do that quickly</li>
<li>will require refactoring plenty of things in the existing code</li>
<li>I'll have to review a lot of Jonathan's code in the process</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>things are going well</li>
<li>have a lot more time lately for Perl 6 and Parrot</li>
<li>currently looking at S11</li>
<li>the documentation for exportation</li>
<li>want to get namespace exporting in Rakudo</li>
<li>that's another step toward writing Rakudo in Perl 6</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we should talk about that</li>
<li>I'll tell you how to do it</li>
<li>I have some pretty specific ideas</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>submitted a grant proposal to TPF for S19</li>
<li>the command-line implementation</li>
<li>lots of IRC conversations</li>
<li>lots of good questions</li>
<li>it's hard to give Moritz enough praise for the work he's been doing on the spec tests</li>
<li>it's amazing progress</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>haven't had much spare time</li>
<li>willing to concentrate on blockers</li>
<li>may be able to fix one or two crazy bugs a week</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we found a workaround for the weird problem we had last night</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you had a lopsided exception handler</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I saw that</li>
<li>switched the order of a few statements</li>
<li>then saw the lopsided exception handler</li>
<li>I'll file my example code as a bug so we can fix it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I talked to Robert about how to get a prominent download link for Rakudo on perl.org</li>
<li>if it's doable to get a nice target page for how to build and use Rakudo, that's easy to get up</li>
<li>need a page to describe the four steps you need to get <em>/usr/bin/perl6</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>and maybe a link for binary distributions</li>
<li>Debian for example</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's not terribly common in the Perl world</li>
<li>Windows maybe</li>
<li>if the package downloads exist, that's a good idea</li>
<li>I don't recommend delaying things for that though</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>one problem with those distributions is that things go so quickly out of date</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the last release was only a couple of weeks ago</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the difference from week to week can be huge</li>
<li>list assignment immediately starts working, for example</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the idea is to shut up naysayers who say "It's not there" or "It's not easy"</li>
<li>people who say "I tried it, but this didn't work" you can point to something current</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>is there a page which describes how to download a tarball and make it go?</li>
<li>versus a Subversion version?</li>
<li>is there a "How to build Rakudo" page?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll put one up on the wiki</li>
<li>someone can help keep it up to date</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there's no reason not to have the canonical version on the wiki</li>
<li>when someone complains, it can get updated</li>
<li>mostly I'm just working and running a small business in a slow economy</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>do you envision the global flag on regexs part of the regex or the caller?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I've thought of it as part of the thing that calls the regex</li>
<li>I could see it going the other way too</li>
<li>no good arguments in my head one way or the other</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>tradtitionally I would have preferred it as the thing that calls the regex</li>
<li>I like it if regexes do one match, and whatever's driving it does it next</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>if you want <code>.*?</code> semantics inside the regex, you ought to use it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>when we parse <code>:g</code>, it's an adverb to the operator, not the regex</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>inside we have submatches with <code>~~</code></li>
<li>people will want adverbs on those</li>
<li>we need to think about whether that's reasonable or possible</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll start with the thing that calls it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we can rethink that later if we need to</li>
<li>we can recast it as rewritten rules of various sorts</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it affects the grammar engine as to what it produces and returns</li>
<li>I could do it</li>
<li>but I'm about to refactor PGE and want to get my strategies in place</li>
<li>Mitchell wants to tag match objects with the rule that generated them</li>
<li>what do you think?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>if we can think of a reasonable name that makes sense downstream</li>
<li>not everything has one</li>
<li>apart from a reference to an object</li>
<li>maybe that's good enough</li>
<li>it's a bit problematic in a Perl 5 version of the matcher</li>
<li>there really aren't code objects</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>maybe, but not likely?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I see no major conceptual problem in the Perl 6 context</li>
<li>just an implementation problem</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>how much might S05 change?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it has potential ramifications in terms of memory use and GC use</li>
<li>other than that, it's a vague uneasy feeling</li>
<li>I can't prove anything</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>.keys</code>, <code>.values</code>, <code>.kv</code>, <code>.pairs</code> methods</li>
<li>when used as functions, are they named unaries?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'd like to avoid making more named unaries than are culturally acceptable in mathematical notation</li>
<li>they tend to confuse people</li>
<li>not as confusing as zero-or-one, which we've tried to get rid of</li>
<li>like <code>rand</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>just looking for a quick answer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm prejudiced against them</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm prejudiced against named unaries as well</li>
<li>if something starts to look non-Perl 5-ish, I get prejudiced</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you force people to use parentheses</li>
<li>but mathemeticians don't want to say sign of something and use parens</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>plenty of tests in the suite test that the values of colon pairs are booleans</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>any boolean used in numeric context turns into zero or one</li>
<li>if we stringify booleans, we have to turn them into zero or one as strings</li>
<li>none of this null string as in Perl 5</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>they do smart match against bool</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>preserve the type information</li>
<li>make it as usefully context-dependent downstream</li>
<li>the issue is how they stringify</li>
<li>similar issue as to how proto-objects stringify</li>
<li>you want to know whether you want to use them as their name or their value</li>
<li>we really don't make that distinction right now</li>
<li>except <code>.perl</code> really wants to know the name of things</li>
<li>if stringify <code>Object</code>, does it print <code>Object</code> or the null string?</li>
<li>if it's our new <code>undef</code>, it should print the null string</li>
<li>when you print values of things, it's not useful to print a null string where they were expecting a value</li>
<li>which is why I wanted to distinguish between stringification and printification</li>
<li>it's probably too subtle of a distinction</li>
<li>if you use a protoobject and stringify it, it returns null</li>
<li>but by default it should produce a warning</li>
<li>the warning presumably says what the name of the protoobject was</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it might be too subtle or wrong a distinction to be useful</li>
<li>a scalar initialized to a protoobject effectively holds a reference to the object</li>
<li>when you stringify the reference, you want that to be the null string</li>
<li>if you print the object, you don't have a reference</li>
<li>you're sending the protoobject itself</li>
<li>I see all sorts of nasty flags floating around that</li>
<li>that distinction will be there from the Parrot side</li>
<li>whether it's there conceptually is another question</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>in general, if I don't answer immediately it's because I'm scratching my head</li>
</ul></p>
