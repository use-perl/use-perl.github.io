<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 07 October 2009.  Larry, Allison,
Patrick, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>did more work on the regex engine</li>
<li>coming along exceedingly well</li>
<li>new engine written primarily in NQP</li>
<li>started in a new GitHub repo</li>
<li>the end goal is to come up with an implementation with built-in support for regexes and grammars</li>
<li>current NQP supports neither</li>
<li>NQP will be the component that handles regex support</li>
<li>it'll be much more maintainable written in NQP</li>
<li>pleasantly surprised at how much easier many of the constructs are to write in this form than in PIR</li>
<li>have a stage one prototype for protoregexes</li>
<li>necessary to implement the grammar for parsing Perl 6 regexes</li>
<li>have most of the base classes for <code>Cursor</code>s and <code>Match</code> objects</li>
<li>doesn't exactly match Larry's STD</li>
<li>but I expect STD to match after Larry sees how I do it</li>
<li>how's that for hubris?</li>
<li>continuing to work on that</li>
<li>would like to have a self-hosted NQP by this time next week</li>
<li>mostly figuring out design issues, bootstrapping, and where the pieces go</li>
<li>had my breakthrough on that on Monday</li>
<li>now it's just however much time I can sit in front of the keyboard</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>worked on the PCC branch this week</li>
<li>very productive</li>
<li>the hackathon was a huge motivation for me</li>
<li>most of the work I did was in the days before the hackathon</li>
<li>I knew that if I could clear away known issues, I could make other people more productive</li>
<li>wasn't coding as much as I was helping other people code during the hackathon</li>
<li>both worked out well</li>
<li>definitely like the hackathon idea</li>
<li>working with Tene on finishing return handling code</li>
<li>that's the last piece</li>
<li>potential blockers are class time</li>
<li>still working on getting a good space for work at University between classes</li>
<li>too much time and trouble to go home and back</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>went to the LLVM conference with diakopter</li>
<li>very informative</li>
<li>forwarded chromatic's questions to Chris Lattner</li>
<li>some good preliminary information</li>
<li>worked on the semantics of warning exceptions</li>
<li>classified them as control exceptions</li>
<li>added a statement prefix <code>quietly</code> to trap warning exceptions</li>
<li>differentiated the use of <code>warn</code> to emit warnings to talk to standard error</li>
<li>the new <code>note</code> function now emits a warning to standard error</li>
<li>it's more informative</li>
<li>suppressed in a different way from trapping an exception</li>
<li>an outcome of going to the LLVM conference:</li>
<li>both the people trying to implement Python and Ruby backends had some serious carpage about the overly dynamic nature of both language definitions</li>
<li>thought about how we can avoid that in Perl 6</li>
<li>using the same approach we defined for finalization, the default is now that after <code>CHECK</code> time, any routine may be aggressively inlined</li>
<li>unless declared ahead of time as prepessimal</li>
<li>still coming up with good terms</li>
<li>you have to predeclare in any of several ways that you're interested in wrapping a function to avoid aggressive inlining</li>
<li>it's okay for the system to refuse to wrap a routine in that case</li>
<li>does not close the door on partial pessimization</li>
<li>if you're willing to inline the check for a wrap, you can get some optimization out of that</li>
<li>the Ruby and Python people are trying to do that</li>
<li>you can only get so far with that</li>
<li>we should be able to make aggressive optimizations, unless the system requests otherwise</li>
<li>need to distinguish routine type from hard or soft inlinable routines</li>
<li>have <code>SoftRoutine</code> and <code>HardRoutine</code> types now</li>
<li>dehuffmanized methods on ranges to return whether <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> are exclusive</li>
<li>added <code>i</code> as a constant, so you don't have to say <code>1i</code></li>
<li>due to scoping, it shouldn't matter if you declare an <code>i</code> routine</li>
<li>yours will take precedence</li>
<li>refined range definitions</li>
<li>even if there's no <code>succ</code> function, you get a range -- but can't do iteration</li>
<li>wrote a long rationalization for why short-circuit <code>and</code> should always turn a <code>False</code> into a <code>Nil</code> in list context</li>
<li>pseudo-spec, apocrypha-spec or something</li>
<li><code>Cursor</code>'s string enum parsing works better</li>
<li>recognizes pair notation with strings</li>
<li>moving files down from the <em>perl6/</em> directory into <em>lib/</em> for hygiene</li>
<li>too much stuff for one directory</li>
<li>refactored the symbol table code</li>
<li>none of it uses hard references anymore</li>
<li>various symbol tables stored in a global hash</li>
<li>refer to each other via symbolic links through that hash</li>
<li>much easier to debug symbol tables</li>
<li>it doesn't chase links all over the place to make information you don't want</li>
<li>stash objects attributes all start with <code>!</code> pseudo-sigil to hide them from normal Perl 6 code</li>
<li>hacked in the <code>quietly</code> statement prefix</li>
<li>finally made internal <code>import</code> work correctly</li>
<li>the <code>Setting</code> now defines the <code>Num</code> package inline and imports constants from it</li>
<li>reorganized <code>Cursor</code> methods into appropriate sections</li>
<li>hope to move some out to separate files</li>
<li>the longest token JITter probably doesn't belong there</li>
<li>the <code>loop</code> construct now requires space between parenthesis and curly for consistency with other constructs</li>
<li>also because I'm mean</li>
<li><code>viv</code> raises the middle argument of a ternary operator to the same level as the left and right arguments</li>
<li>STD symbol table construction now longer adds <code>@_</code> or <code>%_</code> unless it's seen them in the block</li>
<li>Matthew found a terrible bug</li>
<li>a block at the start of a file with the same identifier as a lexical scope was very confusing</li>
<li>lexical scopes with signatures now have a signature variable to tell you that signature</li>
<li><code>my ($a, $b, $c)</code> used to be considered a signature, added to the current pad</li>
<li>that was bogus</li>
<li>it doesn't do that now</li>
<li>generates missing signatures from placeholders or implicit <code>$_</code> semantics when reaching the end of a block</li>
<li>fixed AST bugs in regexes, now returns atoms</li>
<li><code>repeat</code>/<code>while</code> and <code>repeat</code>/<code>until</code> now require whitespace</li>
<li>lots of cleanups in STD</li>
<li>getting rid of useless file-scoped contextuals</li>
<li>chopped out <code>{*}</code> stubs, as neither STD nor <code>viv</code> uses them</li>
<li>refactored Perl 5 into a separate file</li>
<li>loaded on demand</li>
<li>unless you use Perl 5 regexes, you don't get the Perl 5 grammar</li>
<li>started hacking a Perl 5 grammar which parses something that's not really Perl 5 yet</li>
<li>no way to invoke the resulting code, either</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>fixed some Parrot bugs</li>
<li>cleaning up some other things in Parrot</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>regarding development speed of PGE, NQP, etc and the Parrot core</li>
<li>if we have a good, clean module strategy, does it make sense to host them externally?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm already planning that NQP should be a separate module</li>
<li>I expect that NQP will be the primary interface into PCT</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>which makes PCT an external module</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>right</li>
<li>we tell people to use PCT if they want to write languages in Parrot</li>
<li>it'll be a fairly efficient compiler down to PIR</li>
<li>even more than it is now</li>
<li>when it comes time to write a PCT book, it'll be a book about using NQP to write compilers</li>
<li>could be a standalone project</li>
<li>if other people want to write other toolkits, that's fine</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>bytecode generation API should be core to Parrot</li>
<li>other parts belong with PCT, if they're integral parts of PCT</li>
<li>you may have synchronization problems if there are some parts in core and some aren't</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I have that same issue with the grammar engine</li>
<li>we can recouple those components if it makes sense later</li>
</ul></p>
