<div class="span8">
<p><p><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perltestingadn/">Perl Testing: A Developer's Notebook</a> has a lab that shows off a module named <code>Test::Kwalitee</code>.  When run from a test file, this module can analyze a distribution for several Kwalitee measurements.  The book promises that this module is on the CPAN.</p>

<p>It's not.</p>

<p>I <em>had</em> a hacked-up, working proof of concept version when the book went into production.  I knew that I had several weeks to release it before anyone saw the printed book.</p>

<p>Then a new version of the CPANTS distribution came out and there was no longer a good or easy way to re-use the Kwalitee tests on a distribution without uploading it to the CPAN, waiting for the mirror site to get it, then downloading and processing it through the normal means.</p>

<p>Yeah, I <em>could</em> just bundle the version of the CPANTS modules I need with my code, but talk about a maintainability problem....</p>

<p>(I'm sympathetic to the desire to upload an ugly-but-working piece of code for other people to use, then to upload a newer, cleaner version after you've rethought some things, but I dare you to try to get the current CPANTS distribution working.  Sure, my wrapper was plenty ugly ... but wow, the code as I last saw it just <em>doesn't</em> have any escape hatches for me.)</p></p>

<p>If you had told me that you where working on Test::Kwalitee, I'd took more care wrt compability. Anyway, I agree that the current CPANTS implementation is a mess. I've had plans to redo it for quite a time, but missed tuits.</p>

<p>I finally had some time for a very basic design, and (as I'm changing job in February and still have 12 days of holiday left) will find the time to implement it in the next two weeks.</p>

<p>I don't feel as if I have the right to complain much; I intended to work more on the project myself, but had other things come up and ran out of time as well.  I had even planned to write this weblog well before today anyway.</p>
