<p><p>This is my final entry for the day, I promise.  My friend Esther just asked:</p>

<blockquote>Why are you so passionate about what you do? What kind of impact does what you do make?  (or hope to make)  In short, why should anyone else care?</blockquote>

<p>I want software to suck less.  I want to enjoy writing software more.
I want to invest less time with more power for better effect.</p>

<p>I want the people of world to have the freedom to do what they need to do with their computers and their information without needing the high priests of computing to get around to acknowledging their requests or without stopping to pay the proprietary toll road tax every 15 feet.</p>

<p>I refuse to be content with anything less than changing the world, if I have the opportunity to improve it even slightly.</p>

<p>It doesn't have to be software, but that's one area where I have some skill and experience and interest, so I put some of my energy toward that.  I don't talk much in public about other things I do, because they don't have to be public.  (It's difficult to be completely anonymous when one of your hobbies is community-driven Free Software development... but I try.)</p>

<p>Dear reader, why are <em>you</em> here?</p></p>
