<div class="span8">
<p><p>The Perl community needs to discuss the DarkPAN and the present and future of the language and its ecosystem in much more productive ways than accusations, hyperbole, and strawmen.  This includes the people who want to destroy the DarkPAN as well as the people who believe that its stability must be preserved.</p>

<p>I write provocatively and deliberately.  I'm writing a manifesto, after all.  Yet I believe I never devolve to name-calling, strawmen arguments, nor misquoting people.  (If I do, please tell me and I'll correct it.)</p>

<p>My motives are simple: I want regular releases of Perl 5.  I want the <em>default</em> behavior of Perl 5.12 to encourage modern Perl programming practices.  I want missing features added to the language, even in small steps at first if necessary.  <em>I want Perl 5 to be a better language for creating interesting new programs than for maintaining clunky old programs.</em></p>

<p>Here are some selected quotes from <a href="http://consttype.blogspot.com/">RafaÃÂ«l Garcia-Suarez</a>'s <a href="http://consttype.blogspot.com/2009/07/darkpan-matters.html">The DarkPAN matters</a>:</p>

<blockquote><em>DarkPAN is just a slang word to express the fact that Perl 5 is now currently used all over the world in production and sometimes critical systems... asking this question, even rhetorically, makes you sound as if you didn't knew that Perl is actually used in production.</em></blockquote>

<p>When I use the word "DarkPAN", I mean precisely this: code which p5p cannot see, cannot search, does not know the features of, and which may or may not exist.  See also "We can't change this misfeature in the core, because it may break the DarkPAN!" -- funny how that sentence always ends there, rather than including "But of course, we may not, and we'll never know, because it's the DarkPAN."</p>

<blockquote><em>I tend to think that the regular contributors of perl5-porters are a lot more likely to have informed opinions about the Perl 5 core development than people who don't even read it.</em></blockquote>

<p>Pick on me instead then.  If you don't like my opinions, feel free to revert all of my patches over the past eight years.</p>

<blockquote><em>[Who's] trying to be realistic by attempting to release software with some quality expectations, notably by making the upgrade process seamless and introducing as little bugs as possible?</em></blockquote>

<p>Yet those quality expectations <em>did not work</em> in the case of Perl 5.10, with well-known defects continuing to spread as more and more people upgrade to Perl 5.10.  The existing process does not work.  Call it "realistic" if you like, but it did not work for 5.10.  (Note also that <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=22977">one of the blockers to 5.10.1 is RT #22977</a> -- see also <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=50528">RT #50528</a> -- a bug almost six years old that's been present in eleven stable releases of Perl 5.)</p>

<blockquote><em>First, we should not consider breaking it. Breakage happens, but our goal is to avoid it. Secondly, breakage is detected after upgrades, usually (or it would have been avoided).</em></blockquote>

<p>The original point referred to deliberate, backwards-incompatible changes.  Note, however, that a regular release policy could revert accidental breakages on a known, fixed schedule.  The current Perl 5 release policy does not address this at all, which is part of my objection.</p>

<blockquote><em>We just don't like to introduce incompatible changes just for the sake of being incompatible.</em></blockquote>

<p>The only people suggesting making incompatible changes for the sake of incompatibility are people setting up a strawman argument against people like me who write tests, write testing modules, write documentation, write manuals, explore bugs, give talks, teach new users how to write Perl effectively, and occasionally write patches for new features who say "You know, some of the existing features are wrong, and they'd be better off this way."</p>

<p>In other words, this is an attempt to diffuse the real issue.  The question is not and has never been "Should existing code randomly stop working?"  Instead the question is "Can the defaults change in such a way that existing code will still work with perhaps a one-time, one-line change?"  (It may not even require that much change.)</p>

<blockquote><em>[Code] changes don't happen because someone yells about it on a blog. They happen because someone actually writes code.</blockquote></p>

<p>I <em>wrote</em> code.  Rejected.  ("What's the point of a <code>class</code> keywords?  You can always use <code>package</code> and <code>@ISA</code> anyway!  If you need something more, just use any of several dozen <code>Class::*</code> modules on the CPAN!")  Jonathan Leto put together a potential Perl 5.10.1 release that needed only a pull from the appropriate perldelta and a pumpking to release it.  Rejected.  ("Perl 5.10.1 is just around the corner, really, this time we mean it!  Small releases are silly and expensive because of <code>stat</code> calls!  A regular release cycle is like believing in astrology!")</p>

<blockquote><em>But we're not in the land of toy projects here. We can't bless any change (or revert it two releases afterwards) just because it looks shiny at the time. This is not the</em> parrot <em>you're looking for. People do use Perl 5 for serious things, and we must ensure that a certain level of quality is preserved.</em></blockquote>

<p>I can predict the day and date of Parrot releases into the next <em>century</em>.  The number of contributors to Parrot grows over time, as does the frequency of commits.  Parrot right now supports features that the Perl 5 VM will never support, and that feature list will only increase over time.</p>

<p>Dismiss all of that because Parrot is neither as widely-used nor as old as Perl 5 if you like, or even because you think I'm a jerk and you hate everything I care about, but there's one overriding metric for software project management: can people <em>use</em> the software?  (The corollary is that unreleased software effectively does not exist.)</p>

<p>Quibble about the length of our deprecation policy.  Complain that we haven't implemented your pet feature in a way that you like.  Beg us to move a milestone forward.  Berate us for not fixing a bug you don't report.  That's fine.</p>

<p>Yet I believe almost every Parrot committer will agree that our defined support and deprecation policies and our regular release cycle have rescued the project from the very real threats of irrelevance, quality problems, and uselessness.</p>

<p>"Shut up and write some code!" is just a polite (relatively) way of saying "Do it our way or not at all, and above all, do not question the process or its results -- unless you're a core hacker."</p></p>

<p>You seem to be pissed off because I rejected a badly-written patch of yours about a pointless new keyword, and now you're going at war. What's your point in spreading all this FUD really ?

<p>Thank you for finally responding directly to me.</p><blockquote><div><p> <em>You seem to be pissed off...</em></p></div> </blockquote><p>I'm not angry.

If you'd like to discuss the utility of a backwards-compatible non-default syntax change which changes procedural code into declarative code, clarifies the intent of code, collapses at least three lines of boilerplate into one, improves the obvious namespacing of functions, and is forward compatible with further OO systems such as Mouse and Moose, let's put on our language designer hats and discuss it on p5p.</p><p>Don't all serious patches (with tests) deserve such consideration?</p><blockquote><div><p> <em>What's your point in spreading all this FUD really ?</em></p></div> </blockquote><p>If I've spread FUD, I'm open to correction.</p><p>Are the defaults of Perl 5 really correct for new code?  Do I not start all of my new Perl 5 programs with several lines of boilerplate?  Do I not have to teach novice Perl 5 programmers how to convince Perl to help, rather than hinder, them?  Does Perl 5.10.1 have a release date?  Is there a plan for 5.12?  Is there a plan for 5.10.2?</p><p>Do you really think the Perl 5 development process as it is works, in the face of (for example) a known performance regression identified and fixed seventeen months ago in bleadperl yet still unavailable to everyone who wants a stable release?  Would you say, even in jest (as I believe another pumpking did), that people <em>deserve</em> to suffer this performance regression because they didn't test for and discover it until after the release of Perl 5.10?</p><p>Do you believe that it's acceptable from a language design perspective that Perl 5 doesn't have subroutine signatures?  That the default way to inherit from an existing class is to modify a package global variable?  That by default, Perl itself refuses to warn you if you use symbolic references or call undefined symbols or make a typo in a variable name even though in almost every case these are errors of implementation?</p><blockquote><div><p> <em>And seriously are you really believing all this nonsense you're writing about releasing ?</em></p></div> </blockquote><p>Every word -- especially the words about how the average Perl 5 user cannot or will not use unreleased code.  "Patch it yourself, if it's really a problem" is an unacceptable diktat.</p><p>Feel free to tell me to shut up and write more code, if you like -- but if you do so, I would very much appreciate knowing exactly how much code I have to write to express my opinion that the Perl 5 development process has problems.  (I'd also love to know how much code I have to write beyond that point to have my ideas taken seriously, rather than called "FUD" and "warmongering" and "astrology".)</p>

Raphael, I've been a long-time reader of both your blogs and chromatic's.<br/><br/>You seem to basically characterize anyone who agrees with chromatic as 'less experienced'.  That's a bit insulting.  You can count me as one of your former readers now.  And that makes me more sad than angry.

<p>Being less experienced in technical and open source project management issues than Rafael is a very broad statement and certainly not an insult. I consider myself part of that group yet I've been around longer than most.</p>



<blockquote>

<p>It's one thing to present it like it's a fact (I'm in the same group as you, actually more so).  However, it's quite another to use it as a defense of one's tenuous arguments, and as a way of disregarding the opposing view.  To me, painting everyone who agrees with chromatic as such falls into the latter, and indicates the person making the argument is unwilling to listen and unreasonable to deal with.</p>
