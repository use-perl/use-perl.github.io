<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 19 December 2007.  Allison, Patrick, Jerry, Flavio, Richard, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the new perl6 compiler now passes all of the 01-sanity tests again</li>
<li>so it's not the new perl6 compiler</li>
<li>it is now just the perl6 compiler</li>
<li>the number of patch submitters is also increasing</li>
<li>Jonathan Worthington added in a preliminary implementation of junctions, with no prompting from anyone</li>
<li>he also added in hash subscripts and a few other things with minimal prompting</li>
<li>Flavio Glock submitted a patch for <code>BEGIN</code> blocks</li>
<li>I'm pleased with the way the new compiler is structured</li>
<li>it appears easy for other people to add things</li>
<li>next up is working on the test suite</li>
<li>also writing more documentation on how the compiler works and how the pieces fit together</li>
<li>helped Jerry get Punie running, at least behind the scenes</li>
<li>a few little things here and there</li>
<li>I look forward to getting more done this week</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>made Punie run on PCT for the 20th anniversary</li>
<li>Jeff Horwitz made Perl 1 and Perl 6 run in Apache via mod_parrot</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>20 years of Perl has brought us mod_punie</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I improved some Parrot error messages to make life easier</li>
<li>concentrating now on getting Test.pm running so that we can use the Pugs test suite</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>fixed some bugs in the tests, to try to help the release go more smoothly</li>
<li>hope to remove a bunch of removable deprecated stuff</li>
<li>tried to remove <em>src/objects.c</em>, but there were a couple of used things in there</li>
<li>had a discussion with Adam Kennedy about making a <code>perl6</code> binary, probably with the <code>pbc2c</code> utility and installing the PBC files appropriately</li>
<li>seems like a nice little afternoon's diversion</li>
<li>could even make a package for it for Debian or something</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Richard:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I had cake</li>
<li>devoting my efforts into two places</li>
<li>the chaotic maelstrom which is the Perl 5.10 press release</li>
<li>we'll converge on a solution for that shortly</li>
<li>the other bit has been doing some donation prospecting, planning, and contact</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>is anyone writing a report from the recent Chicago Hackathon?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Richard:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I haven't had any contact with them</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>finished up the Events implementation</li>
<li>plan to enable it today</li>
<li>finished a draft of the MMD PDD; I'll commit that shortly</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Flavio:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>started talking with Patrick about implementing some things that kp6 needs</li>
<li>we want to bootstrap kp6 on Parrot</li>
<li>we could run it on P6 on Parrot, then use it to compile itself</li>
<li>we ran into some problems, but Patrick is looking into them</li>
<li>also working on kp6 on Perl 5</li>
<li>bootstrapping will be difficult there, because the speed is so low</li>
<li>we have alternate options</li>
<li>perhaps we could make it work over Moose</li>
<li>then we have to give up on some features</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I sent a message about the <code>eval</code> problem we may have</li>
<li>I'm starting to look at running the Pugs tests</li>
<li>they need a lot of reorganization</li>
<li>many of the tests use <code>eval</code> to do things that we don't need <code>eval</code> to do</li>
<li>I can't tell if they're necessary, or if someone threw it in there because they could</li>
<li>I don't want to interfere too much with what Pugs is relying on</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Flavio:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the main reason for <code>eval</code> was to work around errors that prevented the tests from running</li>
<li>I think it's okay to remove</li>
<li>maybe add some <code>eval</code> extra tests just in case</li>
<li>if it's testing <code>eval</code>, not just the actual test</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I agree completely</li>
<li>I'd hate to break the tests for Pugs though, especially if there aren't people hacking on the Haskell core often</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Flavio:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there aren't really</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>expecting <code>eval</code> to work early on seems like kind of a stretch for a new implementation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>using it to protect yourself from code that doesn't parse, for example</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>right</li>
<li>also looking for a way to mark tests as TODO for various tests</li>
<li>we looked at a way of using smart comments for that</li>
<li>Larry had an idea about that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>seems like a data-driven test</li>
<li>much like the Parrot tests driven by Perl 5</li>
<li>you could do that for just the minimum features necessary to catch parse fails</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll try the comment approach for now and see how it works for Perl 6 on Parrot</li>
<li>might generalize later</li>
<li>is the current subdirectory organization of the tests in Pugs decent, or does it need reorganization?</li>
<li>I find myself looking through various places for the right tests</li>
<li>I don't know if that's me or not</li>
<li>maybe organizing them by Synopsis makes sense</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I agree</li>
<li>test reorganization has been on the list of things we've wanted to do for a while</li>
<li>people are available</li>
<li>we haven't had a direction for that yet</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Flavio:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>many tests were added randomly</li>
<li>there's a site that links tests to the specification</li>
<li>but moving around the tests won't break the documentation, so it's okay</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we could merely duplicate them for a while</li>
<li>keep track of the duplicates</li>
<li>then that site could switch over to the new ones</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Flavio:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you can just move them around</li>
<li>you don't have to ask permission</li>
<li>might be good to start with a stripped-down <em>Test.pm</em> and then an advanced one</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we have an intermediate one</li>
<li>maybe we can segregate tests based on which module we can use</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Flavio:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>any thoughts on logging the #parrot channel?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we discuss that once in a while</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I remember people had concerns about that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>mostly I just run <code>screen</code></li>
<li>no call next week</li>
<li>let's plan to talk on the 2nd then</li>
</ul></p>
