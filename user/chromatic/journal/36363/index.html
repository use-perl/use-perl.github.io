<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 07 May 2008.  Larry, Allison,
Patrick, Will, Jerry, Nicholas, Jesse, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>spent my time this week slicing and dicing the exceptions implementation</li>
<li>replaced the old internals with the new system</li>
<li>checked that in yesterday</li>
<li>still a few failing tests in edge cases on the branch</li>
<li>did more work on the Parrot Foundation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I own an acre of Mars, we could incorporate there</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>don't you own a cow in the Philippines?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>yes, but that doesn't give me any governmental powers</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>isn't that worth a lot?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the peso <em>is</em> improving against the dollar</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>moving on...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>clear bill of health from my medical reports</li>
<li>hacking a lot against the standard grammar in my STD5 implementation</li>
<li>lots of refactoring</li>
<li>all of the various parameters that used to go through separately now go through as part of the Match object</li>
<li>including the "fate" and whether we're peeking at the longest token set</li>
<li>the longest token matcher works now</li>
<li>I threw out my old mechanism for gathering Match objects</li>
<li>it now creates the more-or-less correctly</li>
<li>lots of grammar tweaks, as suggested by Mitchell Charity</li>
<li>lots of refactoring of how logging works so that it doesn't always spew enormous quantities of information to the screen</li>
<li>I can actually run the parser quite quickly now, for some definition of quickly that approximates 2000 characters per second</li>
<li>matches symbols directly, rather than calling a rule, which is faster</li>
<li>does the backoff now on longest token matching</li>
<li>started refactoring the grammar on the assumption that I cna trust the longest token matcher</li>
<li>no longer any <code>nofat</code> rule</li>
<li>the longest token should match the fat arrow, if there is one</li>
<li>started refactoring the quoting rules to parse as if they were sublanguages</li>
<li>getting rid of extra rigamarole to recreate the other mechanism we already use for other languages</li>
<li>working out the linkage for switching in and out of sublanguages</li>
<li>how to get to the outer language from the inner language</li>
<li>calling into pure Perl from closures in a regex</li>
<li>or the host language if you're calling the regex from another language</li>
<li>nailed down the available methods for Match objects in the specs</li>
<li>giving a talk in Seattle on Friday at SPU</li>
<li>flying to Japan on Saturday</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>spent a lot of time teaching this past week</li>
<li>cleared up now</li>
<li>mostly I've answered questions on mailing lists and IRC</li>
<li>I'm not always sure that I'm helpful, but I'm there</li>
<li>yesterday I worked on trying to get a bunch of little small things here and there</li>
<li>fixed up a few things in PCT internals</li>
<li>today I'm bringing PGE up to date with some of the latest changes in S05</li>
<li>these all help Rakudo and other languages in small ways</li>
<li>trying to clean out my backlog and clean up a bunch of RT tickets</li>
<li>I'll continue over the next couple of days</li>
<li>and blogging about it as I go</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>things are busy, mostly non-Parrot related stuff</li>
<li>submitted a ticket that I hope Patrick can close today</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>many languages depend on the old behavior, including Plumhead</li>
<li>I'm not certain about some of them</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>mostly otherwise answering questions on #parrot</li>
<li>making sure that things are set up for the real work phase of GSoC</li>
<li>making sure that students have their CLAs, if not commit bits</li>
<li>astonished to see how much work Jonathan is getting done in just two funded days</li>
<li>it's amazing to see how much a motivator money can be</li>
<li>I'd like to see more of it, <em>hint hint</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>working on closing as many open Parrot bugs as possible</li>
<li>applying as many open patches as possible</li>
<li>should be able to help on the concurrency branch soon</li>
<li>otherwise preparing for the release</li>
<li>going to check on received CLAs this week</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>found it curious that Perl 5.10 has the best <code>state</code> implementation of any language</li>
<li>wanted to steal tests from another implementation</li>
<li>had a discussion with Leon about SMOP</li>
<li>there's no real description of how all of these implementations fit together</li>
<li>Rakudo plus Parrot is a complete implementation</li>
<li>SMOP and kp6 fit together nicely</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I started a wiki page on the Perl 6 wiki at Perl_6_Implementations</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I don't know that it says how things fit together</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I tried to encourage other people to contribute stuff</li>
<li>didn't get much uptake</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>should we suggest to Daniel that he should help explain things?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's more likely to get people contributing to it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there's definitely some confusion about it within the Grants Committee</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>SMOP has the highest documentation-to-line-of-code ratio of any implementation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it needs a good overview though</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll ask Daniel to explain more</li>
<li>especially its relationship to Parrot and Rakudo</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it sounds like it could be an alternate runcore for Perl 5 as well</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>tried a few different things</li>
<li>decided to write a test for Rakudo</li>
<li>tried a simple arithmetic test pulled from Pugs</li>
<li>found that Rakudo didn't implement a function specified in the S29 draft</li>
<li>Patrick helped me write a couple of lines of code to implement it</li>
<li>then discovered that fudge didn't support try blocks in a specific way</li>
<li>Larry patched that</li>
<li>then found that incrementing an undefined value didn't work in Rakudo</li>
<li>that was the end of my day</li>
<li>I still need to write up my findings</li>
<li>how easy is it for someone without experience in Rakudo and its internals to pick things up and contribute something?</li>
<li>more difficult than I thought it might be, but it's getting more doable</li>
<li>it's important to understand how it might fail before trying to get people to do it</li>
<li>then I started trying to play with MAD on the weekend</li>
<li>found and fixed a bug in its XML</li>
<li>refactored it such that you can run MAD's tests in the core if you add a copy of XML::Parser to the core</li>
<li>it's not far enough yet, but it's a start</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>is it going to be difficult to restructure the Parrot foundation from 501(c)(3) to 501(c)(6)?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you can do pretty much the same thing</li>
<li>sponsors are on the board in a c6</li>
<li>they're only advisory in a c3</li>
<li>the sponsors we've talked to are mostly only interested in getting regular status reports and the like</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>is there any jumping around to transfer copyright to the new foundation?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we'll do a copyright assignment from the Perl Foundation to the Parrot Foundation</li>
<li>all of the CLAs that went into the code up to the point of signover will be fine</li>
<li>but we'll essentially copy the Perl Foundation CLA to a Parrot Foundation CLA</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>do we need to contact committers who haven't signed a CLA?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>where does Rakudo fall?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>still under the Perl Foundation</li>
<li>it doesn't move at all</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>do we want to split up the repository at that point?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>eventually, we'll want to do so anyway</li>
<li>it's not an urgent thing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>what would it take to version a Perl6Regex frontend to PGE?</li>
<li>let grammars specify a version of the grammar</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I did that before by having a separate compiler</li>
<li>you're talking about something a bit finer grained</li>
<li>I don't want to do that</li>
<li>as we get closer to 1.0, that'd be fine</li>
<li>I already have enough to do keeping up with the latest versions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I don't think we want to keep up old versions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I don't mind sticking to our deprecation cycle</li>
<li>I hadn't put the change from today into the deprecation list yet</li>
<li>we'll get to it in a couple of weeks</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>just trying to figure out how to push forward with changes to PGE without having to update every language in the repository</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>freeze S05?</li>
<li>not a great solution</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I heard that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the last few changes have been great</li>
<li>I'm not really serious about that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>some of them you even asked for</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's an advantage to have these languages in the repository</li>
<li>we can update them</li>
<li>but only if we can run the tests before and after and know that they pass</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we might consider removing languages with failing tests and no recent updates</li>
<li>there are 17 grant proposals, some of them Perl 6-related</li>
<li>please comment on the TPF blog</li>
<li>it'll help</li>
</ul>
