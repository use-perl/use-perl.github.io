<p><p>The Perl 6 Design Team met by phone on 07 January 2009.  Larry, Jerry,
Allison, Patrick, Jesse, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>real life has been hectic</li>
<li>some family sickness</li>
<li>lots of meetings at work</li>
<li>mostly just sniping at various design issues</li>
<li>not a lot of bandwidth to think through deeper questions</li>
<li>periodically running tests on STD to make sure it keeps passing tests</li>
<li>not much exciting coming up until April</li>
<li>going to Oslo, and then a tour of Ivy League colleges</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>continuing to work in S19</li>
<li>expect to have all of the TODO items addressed this week</li>
<li>should be ready for another review</li>
<li>hopefully close to approval as a working draft</li>
<li>I won't wait for that approval; will start on the tests as soon as I finish the incomplete sections</li>
<li>occasionally offering helpful suggestions and doing small bits of work on Parrot and Rakudo</li>
<li>recent modifications to Rakudo's makefile</li>
<li>added some targets and reorganized for maintainability</li>
<li>also working on parrot.org infrastructure, now that the holidays are over</li>
<li>working on moving Parrot's SVN to parrot.org at the end of January</li>
<li>will probably be able to get a Smolder server set up too</li>
<li>there's some talk of getting a Git mirror available</li>
<li>haven't worked on that yet</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>minor bug fixes and improvements</li>
<li>hope to merge in the GC reorganization refactor tonight or tomorrow</li>
<li>also participating in a discussion with Allison and Patrick about referring to types in other HLLs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>mostly working on my variable handling branch refactoring</li>
<li>Jonathan's working on that too</li>
<li>it's going very well</li>
<li>the code ends up much shorter, and we get better and more correct behavior all around</li>
<li>upgrading PCT and the Perl 6 object system to support changes that we want for Rakudo</li>
<li>they're all minor changes</li>
<li>they're useful for other languages too</li>
<li>Stephen Weeks updated Parrot so that we can have multiple HLLs running in the same interpreter</li>
<li>they run in their own space</li>
<li>we now have the <code>:lang</code> option to <code>eval</code>, where you can run a language other than Perl which Parrot understands</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>how much can you pass between the various languages?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it depends on the other language at the moment</li>
<li>you can get an object back</li>
<li>the other language can't see your lexical variables yet</li>
<li>that's just Rakudo at the moment</li>
<li>you can send messages to those objects</li>
<li>he's reimplementing Pheme to use PCT which should make that easier</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that only works for <code>eval</code> right now and not <code>use</code></li>
<li>that's just a matter of syntax</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we don't have the ability to define custom quote operators from within Perl 6 yet</li>
<li>it wouldn't be too hard to add a special one</li>
<li>or a function which did that for you</li>
<li>continuing on the variable branch</li>
<li>Jonathan and I are in alignment on how we expect things to work</li>
<li>expect to merge in the next day or two</li>
<li>that'll close a bunch of tickets</li>
<li>especially in dealing with parameter oddities and such</li>
<li>then I'll update the roadmap</li>
<li>it's kind of out of date, thanks to our progress in December</li>
<li>we can mark a lot of things as done now</li>
<li>I'll revise it to be something more prose-y</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>will you need to add tasks to the roadmap?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I can't think of any we need to add</li>
<li>we can update timelines on a lot of them</li>
<li>because we finished some prerequisites</li>
<li>some things we thought wouldn't be possible for a while are now within the realm of possibility</li>
<li>we fixed lexicals, for example</li>
<li>I continue to be surprised at things which do get working</li>
<li>some of the things that Jonathan and Stephen do, I can't believe we're there already</li>
<li>there's been a lot of talk online about people using Rakudo and Perl 6 to solve their problems</li>
<li>things are definitely progressing</li>
<li>lots of them say "Not everything works, but the progress is amazing!"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>your post on the Winter Scripting Games sparked a lot of activity</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that was the intended effect</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>mainly working on integrating patches and reviewing tickets</li>
<li>concentrated on Reini Urban's install branch</li>
<li>finished integrating changes to the calling conventions branch</li>
<li>now we need to test that and use new features throughout the code</li>
<li>speaking about Parrot this Thursday in San Francisco</li>
<li>two weeks from now will speak at UC Davis</li>
<li>three weeks from now at IBM's research center in New York</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>pondering quite a bit lately</li>
<li>looking for suggestions for people to take over Perl 6 coordination</li>
<li>make sure projects talk to each other</li>
<li>have someone moderately impartial to moderate when heads bang together</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>more like Jono Bacon's community manager role in Ubuntu</li>
</ul></p>
