<p><p>It's been a while.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://oscon.kwiki.org/">OSCON</a> came and went, taking one timesink off my hands.  Next year will be easier.</li>

<li><a href="http://blog.simon-cozens.org/">Simon</a>'s returned to <a href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl.com</a>, so I'm no longer guest editor.  That's another, albeit pleasant, timesink gone.</li>

<li><a href="http://wgz.org/chromatic/perl/">Text::WikiFormat</a> 0.70 is out, with much thanks to <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/kake/">Kake</a> for working with me to find bugs and add missing features and Andy H. for an excellent suggestion that took me a long time to understand but a short time to implement.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/07/29/exegesis6.html">Exegesis 6</a> is up on Perl.com, which required a lot of editing work on my part (not to touch the prose, just to get it prepped for publishing).  I also defended Perl 6 and Parrot on Slashdot today.  It's someone else's turn.</li>

<li>My house is substantially cleaner, though I desperately need to go through <a href="http://www.gnucash.org/">Gnucash</a>'s tutorials and get my finances in better order.</li>

<li>I created a "preload dynamic content" branch on <a href="http://sf.net/projects/everydevel/">Everything</a> the other day.  The idea is to speed up the site by precompiling all of the dynamic content necessary.  It's taking a lot less trickery than you'd think, and it seems to be paying off.  The real test will be cleaning things up after I'm satisfied that it's working.</li>

<li>While tracking down odd errors in my branch, I realized that my installation was quite a bit out of date.  The installer annoyed me (as nearly everything using the DOM does), so I refactored the installer and made it use XML::SimpleObject::LibXML instead.  It's much nicer, but there's still room for improvement.</li>

<li>Day-job-wise, it looks like the barrage of tasks will lighten up around the first week of September, giving me, perhaps, a little more time to do some development.  On the other hand, I seem to have found myself editing two books, so it might just be a different type of busy!</li>

<li><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/schwern/">Schwern</a> and I are meeting tomorrow to discuss an outline for the book we should have written last year.  He's a first time author, but this is my fourth (or fifth, if you're <em>really</em> charitable), so it makes sense to me.</li>

<li>I seem to have found myself putting together a TV show.  It's a one-shot, full-hour local show.  Excellent.</li>

</ul></p>

<p>I've been using it for more 16 months or so.  The tutorials are good enough, but it's more like a real accounting program than Quicken (gnucash use the double entry account model where Quicken uses its own thing).  I keep my invoices listed in gnumeric.  So for all my develop and office work, I use Linux/Open Source apps.  For screwing around, I use Windows.
</p><p>As for defending perl on slashdot, I think you hardly need to do that.  Trying to raise the quality of debate on slashdot is like trying to empty the ocean with a siv.  I used to try to do that once upon a time, than I had a burst of Zen-like acceptence about the whole affair.  Ignorance and biggotry abounds, but that has nothing to do with me -- other fish to fry.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

I have this little hope squirreled away that somehow, someday, somewhere, someone makes a set of drop-in replacements for Quicken and QuickBooks.  From what I've seen, the people using these programs are small business folk, and it would be a no-brainer for most of them.  "They do the same thing and this one's free?  Um, yeah, I'll take the free one."

<h2>Books!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rooneg/">rooneg</a> on 2003-07-31T12:09:47</h3>
So what's the book (the one you and Schwern are planning to write, not the ones you're editing) about?
<p>
Oh, and let me just say that I never appreciated how much time and effort went into these things until I started work on mine.  I seem to remember this time, long ago, when I had free time, but I'm not sure, I might just be hallucinating.</p>

Yes, the cycle of "wake up, work, eat, write, sleep, wake up, work, eat, write, sleep" got a little tedious after six months.  I threw in some bitching and moaning to keep things interesting.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>Re:Books!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2003-07-31T16:57:11</h3>
<p>It's about 250 pages, about the one thing Schwern and I both do well.  Procrastinate!  No, wait.  Annoy pumpkings!  Hmm, that's still not it.</p>

<p>I don't like talking about deals that aren't quite done, but the astute reader will already have an idea.</p>

Eek.  That last one got away.  Sorry.<br> <br>So, as I was saying...<br> <br>I can't believe no one's asked about this yet:<br> <br> <i>I seem to have found myself putting together a TV show. It's a one-shot, full-hour local show. Excellent.</i> <br> <br>Eh?<br>

<p>A local TV production company has some studio time and wants to do an hour show on open source software and development in the Portland area.  I'm rounding up a handful of other people to talk about various facets for a few minutes apiece.  We'll have a discussion for the other half.</p>

<p>It's public access TV, so it won't be seen all that much in the area, but there's a non-zero possibility we'll be able to tape it and use it later, if it turns out well.</p>

<p>Don't worry, it's not <em>Shoggoth's Dance Party</em>, as everyone immediately feared.  (More about that in my next journal.)</p>
