<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 19 November 2008.  Larry, Allison, Patrick, Jerry, Jesse, Will, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>will let someone else discuss the Parrot Developers Summit</li>
<li>released Parrot 0.8.1 yesterday</li>
<li>mostly smooth, but didn't get in all of the features we wanted</li>
<li>looking at the plan for the next few months to figure out my next features</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>even if Parrot 0.8.1 didn't give all of the features we wanted, it was a useful deprecation point</li>
<li>lots of things merging into trunk today</li>
<li>the Parrot Developers Summit went very well this weekend</li>
<li>concentrated on bugfixes and getting lexicals to work</li>
<li>we were 95% of the way on Saturday</li>
<li>then I added one last feature, and everything fell apart</li>
<li>reviewing how Parrot manages contexts to figure that out</li>
<li>something's wrong with the collection of contexts</li>
<li>haven't worked on it much since Sunday, but working on it again today</li>
<li>updated the Rakudo roadmap in the Parrot repository</li>
<li>that looked pretty good</li>
<li>otherwise, little changes here and there</li>
<li>closed 10 or 12 tickets yesterday</li>
<li>more of the same coming up for me</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>organized the PDS over this weekend</li>
<li>most important thing we did was create the roadmap for Parrot 1.0</li>
<li>release date will be March 2009</li>
<li>it'll be a stable platform for high-level language implementors</li>
<li>Allison, chromatic, and I posted more details on use.perl.org and parrot.org</li>
<li>the most visible work product is the Parrot roadmap, which lists important and critical tasks for Parrot 1.0 and beyond</li>
<li>haven't made much progress on my grant in the past week</li>
<li>turning back to that now that the conference is over</li>
<li>hope to do a whiteboarding session with a couple of local developers later this week</li>
<li>then I'll have a draft for review</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>extremely pleased with the way the Summit went</li>
<li>makes a big difference to be able to say that we can deliver 1.0 in March</li>
<li>seems to be making a difference internally as well</li>
<li>working on the IO architecture</li>
<li>about to do the first merge back to trunk here shortly</li>
<li>have the copyright assignment from TPF to the Parrot Foundation as well</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>is Rakudo part of that?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's explicitly excluded</li>
<li>that copyright stays with TPF</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>but NQP stays with Parrot?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>as does PGE and the Parrot Compiler Toolkit</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the <em>tryfile</em> program now reports time and memory usage of the compilation it does</li>
<li>spent a lot of time refactoring the LTM to get rid of string processing and storage</li>
<li>switched over to a trie implementation, which is closer to a DFA implementation</li>
<li>uses less memory and is faster</li>
<li>not a great deal of either, but it's progress</li>
<li>a bad bug in STD's operator precedence parser</li>
<li>built nested pre- and post-fix operators inside out</li>
<li>fixed that and hopefully improved the algorithm at the same time</li>
<li>building STD now builds a Storable grammar of all of the lexers</li>
<li>should start up faster now</li>
<li>lexers can now reuse the patterns of the lexers of the parent class if they haven't changed</li>
<li>cuts down memory usage</li>
<li>refined the LTM tiebreaking rules as part of the trie switch</li>
<li>if there's a tie, the first tiebreak is "which if the two rules had more literal characters matched at its front?"</li>
<li>if you match a specific keyword exactly, it takes precedence over a generic rule which matches <code>\w*</code></li>
<li>seems to be DWIMmier</li>
<li>if that fails, it falls back on order tiebreaking</li>
<li>thinking a lot about iterator semantics and the API, mainly at Daniel Ruoso's request</li>
<li>several different ways to go</li>
<li>several different use cases</li>
<li>probably a matter of allowing any of those semantics underneath, but picking a good default</li>
<li>probably neither strictly lazy nor strictly eager</li>
<li>about four different gradations of laziness versus easiness</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>attempting to figure out where we are with Synopses and spec tests and implementations</li>
<li>when Parrot migrates to Trac, does Rakudo migrate to RT?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it stays in RT on the perl.org infrastructure</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>is there a broad announcement of the plan?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the roadmap is the main written information we produced</li>
<li>we should write out the general migration too</li>
<li>other languages will make their choices too as they move to public repositories</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>before the March release, Rakudo will move into its own repository on perl.org</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>in general, ripping stuff out of Parrot</li>
<li>trying to make ParTcl go faster</li>
<li>if anyone wants to help with that, let me know</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Tim Bunce has been doing great in Perl 5</li>
<li>and he's positive about Parrot</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>profiling tools aren't on the list for 1.0</li>
<li>but if they get done before then, great!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>did someone name S17 from "Threads" to "Concurrency"?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the canonical source for the Synopses is going to move to the Pugs repo</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there will be announcements to the mailing lists</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>will there be any changes to version numbers and date updates?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>they stay up to date pretty well</li>
<li>people can be mindful of that</li>
<li>we can put commit hooks on them there too</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we won't meet next week</li>
<li>I'll send mail confirming that</li>
</ul></p>
