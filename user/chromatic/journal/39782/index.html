<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 30 September 2009.  Larry, Allison, Patrick, Jerry, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>went to Linux Con</li>
<li>spoke at Bay Piggies</li>
<li>talked to the Unladen Swallow people</li>
<li>refreshing the PCC branch for Parrot</li>
<li>looking forward to a hackathon this weekend</li>
<li>playing with Git, trying to get a handle on how people use branches</li>
<li>I think we can comfortably use Git with SVN as the backing store if we fine-tune our processes a little bit</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>working on updates to PGE</li>
<li>going very well</li>
<li>hacking in the beginnings of protoregexes today</li>
<li>none of the code does anything, but I have the basic pieces in place</li>
<li>will have the glue in soon</li>
<li>entirely PAST- and POST-based</li>
<li>PGE generated PIR</li>
<li>now you build up your regexes using PAST nodes</li>
<li>the compiler emits POST notes</li>
<li>that can go to PIR or eventually PBC or another output format</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>even Perl 5, if someone were sufficiently crazy</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's a possibility at some point</li>
<li>get correct lexical and block handling for free</li>
<li>patching that into the old PGE would take a bit of work</li>
<li>had a local hackathon here on Saturday</li>
<li>we updated complex number handling and something else</li>
<li>also marked a lot of tickets in RT as LHF -- low-hanging fruit</li>
<li>won't require heroics of information or compiler knowledge</li>
<li>easy to find a bunch of tickets that novices can work on</li>
<li>plan to continue working on the regex engine</li>
<li>hope to pass the PGE test suite in a couple of days</li>
<li>once I can do that, I'll start switching NQP to the new engine</li>
<li>should speed up NQP</li>
<li>NQP will support regexes and grammars</li>
<li>then NQP can be the main interface for all of the compiler toolkit writers</li>
<li>write and compile a program in NQP and you end up with a compiler</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>this will benefit from optimization stages for PAST and POST</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>this will probably be one of the first stages where an optimization stage shows up</li>
<li>we can optimize a regex tree at the PAST step</li>
<li>seems likely</li>
<li>haven't come up with a name for the new engine</li>
<li>calling it PAST-regex, the regex portion of NQP</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>going to the LLVM conference on Friday with Matthew Wilson</li>
<li>managed to get a pass from the right people</li>
<li>if you have any questions, please send them to him or me</li>
<li>decided to require parens on method calls with quoted names</li>
<li>helps detect accidental use of dot as concatenation</li>
<li>Patrick noticed that I used <code>temp</code> and <code>let</code> in regular expressions</li>
<li>documented that you can do that</li>
<li>tired of the <code>defines</code> infix; now we have a statement control <code>import</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that one didn't last long!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it didn't work well</li>
<li>the notion of an infix with <code>BEGIN</code> semantics was problematic</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I like it much better</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you can import an inline module</li>
<li>still trying to <em>implement</em> that</li>
<li>redid the import code</li>
<li>works for external modules, but not internal yet</li>
<li>did a major overhaul of types</li>
<li>split more of the abstract roles such as <code>Numeric</code> and <code>Integral</code></li>
<li>added <code>Real</code> and <code>Stringy</code></li>
<li>decided we were trying to do too much with pairs and mappings</li>
<li>broke those into immutable and mutable types</li>
<li>trying to document type relationships better now, especially in the numerics</li>
<li>replacing <code>defines</code> with <code>import</code> in the code</li>
<li>Carl noticed the lack of report of nonexistent variables used in the default of a parameter</li>
<li>easy to fix by localizing the appropriate flag</li>
<li>packages and namespaces have much more informative ID fields, including lexical scopes</li>
<li>contain file and line position now</li>
<li>we can track lexical scopes even if they're not linked into other scopes directly</li>
<li>a debugger can access other lexical scopes</li>
<li>redeclaration messages on symbol conflicts now leaves off "lexical" on lexical collisions</li>
<li>package conflicts now include the package name with the symbol</li>
<li>much more readable</li>
<li>infix operators now can perform various checks during reduction in the operator precedence parser</li>
<li>the <code>.=</code> rules, for example, is an infix that used to check that it was a Perl 5 version</li>
<li>it didn't have enough information at that point</li>
<li>now you can set a callback for the reduction point</li>
<li>it has enough information to do an obsolescence check there now</li>
<li>deleted the obsolete form of method with an adverbial</li>
<li>have to decide what to do with prefix operators that leave out <code>prefix</code></li>
<li>STD recognizes stubs with <code>...</code> and doesn't complain about redefinition</li>
<li>fairly intelligent approach</li>
<li>if the top-level operator is <code>...</code> or a friend, it's a stub</li>
<li>not just textual analysis</li>
<li>it even allows statement modifiers</li>
<li>removed the grammar terms for <code>pi</code>, <code>e</code>, and <code>i</code></li>
<li>they're constants in <code>CORE::</code></li>
<li>upgrading <code>viv</code> in various ways as Matthew discovers places where it doesn't propagate information into the AST correctly</li>
<li>rad numbers now parse</li>
<li>regexs now produce more correct ASTs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>fixed some bugs</li>
<li>will fix more bugs</li>
<li>working on longer term planning for Parrot</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>will the PGE changes speed up Rakudo more than the Parrot optimizations?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I don't know</li>
<li>it'll be hard to measure</li>
<li>I get the advantage of all of the Parrot speedups</li>
<li>the new system is a lot friendlier in terms of object creation</li>
<li>it doesn't create as many objects as PGE does</li>
<li>I've optimized down most of the backtracking state</li>
<li>kept as a single <code>ResizableIntegerArray</code></li>
<li>other objects created to keep track of the state of the match</li>
<li>backtracking is basically clipping an array of size 10 to size 5, for example</li>
<li>don't have to keep track of nearly as much information</li>
<li><code>Cursor</code>s and <code>Match</code> objects are much more immutable</li>
<li>much smarter about creating them</li>
<li>creates them only when there's a mutating change</li>
<li>should have a lot less GC pressure</li>
<li>less jumping around</li>
<li>smarter about backtracking points</li>
<li>should be able to do a basic benchmark on the PGE tests in the old system and the new system</li>
<li>that'll tell us quite a bit</li>
<li>protoregexes should gives us a lot of speedup</li>
<li>we get to avoid a lot of false trails by pruning a lot of trees that Rakudo's parser goes down</li>
<li>can detect potential rules and jump right to them</li>
<li>can avoid checking rules that can't possibly match</li>
<li>if you're parsing an expression right now, we check for all of the types of statements, and then parse it as an expression</li>
<li>if you do that for every statement, it takes a while</li>
<li>lots of GCables created for those checks too</li>
<li>we'll know in a couple of weeks</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>reducing GC pressure always helps</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the old version was faithful to the Perl 6 method</li>
<li>every rule is a method with a slurpy hash</li>
<li>the new version doesn't do that</li>
<li>it gets the slurpy hash options out of the way at the beginning</li>
<li>the rest can ignore it</li>
<li>at least for now, it's not making empty slurpy hashes on every rule</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you talked about a cloning system outside of PGE before</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it'd be nice if Parrot had a way to access something as a hash and have it build up the hash only when you read them</li>
<li>regardless of speed improvements, we need protoregexes and contextuals to make spec progress</li>
<li>we'll go this way even if there's no speed improvement</li>
<li>pointed out a problem with having methods on a <code>Match</code> object with the same name as rules</li>
<li>does having <code>Cursor</code>s not behave like <code>Match</code> objects present a problem?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>inheritance fixes one direction of the problem, but not the other</li>
<li>what a user views as a <code>Match</code> object might contain the <code>Cursor</code> used to produce it</li>
<li>might start from there</li>
<li>probably needs to be a separate type from the user's point of view</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>regexes still return <code>Cursor</code>s?</li>
<li>it's easy to get to a <code>Match</code> object from there?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the method that implements a regex?</li>
<li>that returns a <code>Cursor</code></li>
<li>what the user uses as what she thinks of as a normal regular expression, she gets back a <code>Match</code> object</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you can't use the methods on <code>Match</code> in a grammar</li>
<li>the only problematic one was <code>pos</code></li>
<li>there's a method conflict there</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we might make the builtins uppercase</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm making them private with exclamation points for now</li>
<li>I know you can't access them from subclasses</li>
<li>if and when we decide to make them public, we can do that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>maybe we can make a way of disambiguating them</li>
<li>if there's a conflict in the rules...</li>
<li>that part works pretty well</li>
<li>the <code>pos</code> comes from the base class</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>if I do <code>Cursor.pos</code>...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you can say <code>Cursor::.pos</code></li>
<li>we can work with it in that direction</li>
<li>try to disambiguate to the outside one, if it's something internal</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we could delegate the subscripting operator to the <code>Match</code> object</li>
<li>haven't needed that yet</li>
<li><code>STD</code> doesn't do that</li>
<li>it treates the <code>Cursor</code> as a hash in a few places</li>
<li>could easily go through the <code>Match</code> to do that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><code>STD</code> cheats all over the places</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Perl 6 is being built by a bunch of cheaters!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>something there represents an object attribute of some point</li>
<li>most cheats are to make it work correctly on Perl 5</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the Saturday before a Parrot release used to be a Bug Day</li>
<li>has that fallen by the wayside?</li>
<li>is that a good or a bad thing?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>yes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's expanded into the week before a release</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we stopped advertising it in our release annoucements</li>
<li>we've talked about having a dedicated hackathon day</li>
<li>the Saturday before a release probably isn't the right day for it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we're doing a PCC hackathon this weekend</li>
<li>the amount of time before the next release is a good idea</li>
<li>we can merge some changes into trunk before that release</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that distinction seems quite sensible</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>at one point, we had a bugfixing hackathon the weekend before the release and a hacking hackathon the weekend after</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we're also trying to increase the bus number for features and branches</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the bugday was nice as a time to introduce new contributors to Parrot</li>
<li>now we have other ways to get them excited about using Parrot</li>
<li>downloadable and installable packages, for example</li>
</ul></p>
