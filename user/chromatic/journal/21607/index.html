<p><p>If "too many choices" of applications in the typical Linux distribution is really keeping people on Windows, why aren't there more people starving to death in the cereal aisles of grocery stores?</p></p>

<h2>because once you make a choice</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2004-10-30T22:05:58</h3>
the interface of either eating it straight out of the box, e.g. captain crunch or honeycomb or sugar smacks, or the bowl, spoon and milk interface, is easy for even small children to master in a short amount of time. Spillage, spoilt milk or the dust at the end of the box are known bugs and can be avoided. Once you choose a linux app, your work is just beginning with no sugary goodness or toy prize in the bottom of the box. They're also not fortified with 9 essential vitamins and minerals.



<h2>varieties of linux cereal</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/KLB/">KLB</a> on 2004-10-31T20:39:54</h3>
There is very little real choice among the products in the cereal aisles of grocery stores - the actual product contents (manufactured cereal) is pretty much the same stuff in most of the boxes - it is primarily the packaging (and associated advertising) that is used to differentiate the product to the consumer. You may not starve from lack of cereal but you certainly are going to find it difficult to find some substantial variety. It is no wonder that most consumers latch onto a particular branded product and don't switch.<br> <br>Linux systems seem to be much the same - the core systems are effectively identical among the many distributions. Yes, there are subtle and not so subtle differences in the user interface and other such add-ons included in a distriubution to make them "look" different. It is no wonder that the consumer can get confused about all of this. Having a single Windows solution makes the choice so much easier.<br>
