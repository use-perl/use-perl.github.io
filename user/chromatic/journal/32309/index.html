<p><p>The Perl 6 Design team met via phone on 24 January 2007. Larry, Patrick, Nicholas, and chromatic attended. These are the notes.</p>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>aside from plumbing...</li>
<li>continue to deal with the fallout from trying to define what it actually means to match longest tokens consistently across a grammar</li>
<li>Luke and I had some interesting back and forth on that</li>
<li>we're probably converging on something workable on that score</li>
<li>thinking about the message from Steve Lukas</li>
<li>"remember to outlaw declaring lexical variables twice in the same scope"</li>
<li>there are some arguments on the other side</li>
<li>thinking about what the default should be there</li>
<li>thinking a lot about list comprehensions and how their syntax can fall out naturally from how we already express things with maps and for loops and such</li>
<li>inside the opening bracket is now implicitly the start of a statement in terms of the syntax recognized at that point</li>
<li>you can put for loops within parentheses now without explicitly saying do</li>
<li>the notion of how you return a list of lists such that by default they flatten</li>
<li>also such that you can get the result back as a list of lists if you want to</li>
<li>some discussion about whether a list of captures can lazily decide based on context if people want a flat list or want it chunked</li>
<li>other thoughts on syntaxes and defaults and such</li>
<li>also the ever-going discussion on ints and nums and such</li>
<li>need to install some of my decisions into S03</li>
<li>I realize it's organized by braindump and not how an operator spec needs to be</li>
<li>I'm about to reorganize it in precedence order as in the Perl 5 perlop page</li>
<li>logical way to talk about ops, especially those that haven't changed</li>
<li>we need to spec those</li>
<li>it's a big fault of the Synopsis as it is now</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>not much happened this week thanks to ice storms and school closures</li>
<li>worked on PAST-pm</li>
<li>have references working in Perl 6</li>
<li>found that assign opcode doesn't work on arrays when you have a derived class of ResizablePMCArray PMC</li>
<li>derivation from base class problem in Parrot</li>
<li>yet another workaround to put in there</li>
<li>keep running into the need for a new object model</li>
<li>if you create a subclass from one of the existing PMC classes, some operations just don't work as you'd expect</li>
<li>I have a workaround I'm almost ready to check in though</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I'd like to see a TODO test for that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>worked on other things we need for the AST representation</li>
<li>better HLL type management</li>
<li>it doesn't feel right</li>
<li>I'll work on some other things to let that sit for a while and see how it works</li>
<li>giving a presentation this Friday in Austin</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>trying to go through a hundred patches a day on Perl 5</li>
<li>feels like working at right angles</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>managed to implement the namespaces PDD work on the NameSpace PDD</li>
<li>should have that whole PDD implemented by the next release</li>
<li>that ought to allow better implementation of the metamodel</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>yay!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Larry, you mentioned "item context"</li>
<li>is that a rebranding of scalar?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>we use "scalar" to refer to the container</li>
<li>the context we refer to as "item context" these days</li>
<li>it's been there for a year or so</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I missed that</li>
<li>I like it better</li>
<li>it's clearer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>we didn't want "atom"</li>
<li>"item" is close</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>what does your work program need from a Perl 6 implementation?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the coverage of the Haskell backend with the speed of the Parrot backend</li>
<li>it'd be nice to have language support for the rule engine</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>does your program use that?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>mostly OO</li>
<li>I could use roles to speed it up some to avoid some method lookup</li>
<li>still thinking about multidispatch semantics</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>maybe that's why Damian isn't here</li>
<li>he's thinking about it too</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>he can't decide which Damian to send</li>
</ul>
