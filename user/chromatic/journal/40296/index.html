<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 31 March 2010.  Larry, Allison, Patrick, Will, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>in SpecLand, made it clear that the brackets in pairs are not related to subscripts, but follow the corresponding fatarrow semantics</li>
<li>in particular, name extenders are just strings or list of strings, properly indicated by :<> or :() in most cases (this includes all operator names).</li>
<li>we now forbid name extension using the <code>:{}</code> keyless adverbial syntax</li>
<li>we don't need that because name extensions are really only supposed to use values, not closures</li>
<li>if we really, really, need to supply a closure as part of a name extension, we can put it in parens, as in <code>:({})</code>.</li>
<li>we can use that notation for supplying a closure as a first argument to a method without requiring a space between the colon and the curly, as in <code>.map:{...}</code></li>
<li>people keep writing that and expecting it to work, so I thought it would be good to make it work</li>
<li>the colon is still require before the curlies, or it's a hash subscript</li>
<li>we now capitalize the <code>Junction</code> type again because I couldn't get people to stop capitalizing it</li>
<li>also, the native aspect of junctions is not their most salient difference from normal types</li>
<li>conjectured an <code>Each</code> type that autothreads lists like junctions, but is serial and lazy, and is used for its values in list context, not boolean context</li>
<li>in S05, did much cleanup of cursor semantics to reflect what STD and Rakudo actually do these days</li>
<li>retargeted the <code>&lt;&amp;foo&gt;</code> regex assertion form to explicitly call a routine, just like <code>&lt;.foo&gt;</code> always calls a method</li>
<li>a bare <code>&lt;foo&gt;</code> assertion now prefers to call a lexical function if visible, or calls as a method in current grammar if not</li>
<li>this is a compile-time distinction, not a fallback at run time</li>
<li>in code hacking, continued debugging of the backtracking transactions I added last week</li>
<li><code>gimme5</code> now sets the correct xact on <code>||</code> alternations</li>
<li>deleted more of the transactions that are no longer needed when building match results that are no longer hypothetical</li>
<li>a <code>LazyMap</code> now always passes through the first result regardless of its associated commit transaction state</li>
<li>that's because the first cursor in a lazy list always represents the current match hypothesis, not a future hypothesis that needs pruning</li>
<li>STD now parses to the new specs regarding name extensions not including <code>:{}</code></li>
<li>now allow colon form of method arguments to omit the space if the next char is a left curly, which is what people seem to expect anyway</li>
<li>note that this makes the closure the first argument, not the only argument</li>
<li>STD now gives more useful error messages when user says things like 'if' as a function call (<code>if(...) {...}</code>), or a statement control like 'given' where one isn't expected (<code>$x = given {...}</code>)</li>
<li>STD now properly objects to unrecognized internal regex modifiers such as <code>:has</code></li>
<li>improved the message on adverbs with empty angles (<code>:foo&lt;&gt;</code>) to list some better options</li>
<li>the problem arises when people think that the angles produce a null string, when in fact they produce a <code>Nil</code> list</li>
<li>other malformed pairs are also better diagnosed, such as <code>:!</code> not followed by an identifier, or pairs with duplicate arguments</li>
<li>added a new <suppose X> rule that traps all warnings and errors</li>
<li>STD now uses <code>suppose</code> in place of custom try blocks in diagnosing such things as two terms in a row, or unexpected infixes</li>
<li>also uses <code>suppose</code> to soften the warning about backtick-less embedded comments by not complaining if the supposed comment eats the whole line anyway</li>
<li>put in some code to de-dup identical warnings</li>
<li>STD now includes the signature's return type (after <code>--&gt;</code>) in the check for redundant '<code>of</code>' types</li>
<li>did various tiny speed tweaks, fossil removals</li>
<li>started playing with how to mark sink context and pure operations</li>
<li>split out <code>Actions.pm</code> from <code>viv</code> so that it can be used by other STD-based AST builders</li>
<li>this is in preparation for propagating attributes up and down the AST such as sink context and purity</li>
<li>eventually this will result in "Useless use of" messages where appropriate, not to mention the ability to do constant folding</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>worked on the <code>compact_pool()</code> function</li>
<li>split it into a series of smaller functions</li>
<li>it could use more work, but it's an improvement</li>
<li>found one possible bug</li>
<li>worked on some documentation, especially for PMC attributes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>reviewed some patches to add variable handling in regexes</li>
<li>they need some changes, but the overall concept is good</li>
<li>reviewed a few other messages</li>
<li>most of my time is going toward my family</li>
<li>hope to get more time to be more active in the next couple of days, but I can't promise that yet</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>talked to Jonathan about Rakudo Star priorities</li>
<li>he's very pleased with the memory fixes</li>
<li>the next thing on his list is getting good line numbers in reported errors</li>
<li>closing tickets</li>
<li>working to get rid of the last recursive Makefile</li>
<li>may wait until after the new release, when we remove a lot of deprecated things</li>
<li>practicing my NQP skills by working on Tcl again</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>worked on the Rakudo memory problems</li>
<li>Vasily and I fixed the big memory use problem</li>
<li>still some performance tuning to do there</li>
<li>wrote up tasklists for two other important performance pieces</li>
<li>will work on line numbers after we get performance back</li>
</ul></p>
