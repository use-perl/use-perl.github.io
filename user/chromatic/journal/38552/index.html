<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 18 February 2009.  Larry, Patrick, Allison, Jerry, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>fixed STD so that if you added <code>A::B</code>, it added <code>A</code> as a subpackage</li>
<li>so as not to complain about a missing package declaration</li>
<li>can now have <code>$!</code> as a parameter</li>
<li>mostly working over a lot of the error messages to be friendly to Perl 5 programmers</li>
<li>if you use <code>do</code>/<code>while</code> or <code>do</code>/<code>until</code> it now complains</li>
<li>if you use <code>if</code> or one of the keywords as if it's a function, it tells you what the problem is without saying "I don't recognize that function name"</li>
<li>people coming from a Haskell background think they can write <code>1..</code> to get an indefinite range</li>
<li>it now tells them what they should write instead</li>
<li>fixed a bug which reported runaway strings which start and stop on the same line</li>
<li>not really a runaway</li>
<li>now it reports that only if the string crosses a newline</li>
<li>in the spec space</li>
<li>to accompany the ability to use a bare sigil in declarations as an anonymous name, now you can use a bare <code>::</code> to signify an anonymous package name or type</li>
<li>allows us to have a package named <code>is</code> without ambiguity</li>
<li>blew away the <code>Main</code> package; combined it with the <code>GLOBAL</code> package</li>
<li>everything in the main program comes up starting in the <code>GLOBAL</code> namespace</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>oh, I'm happy!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>thought the distinction served no useful purpose</li>
<li>continued doing spec work combining context variables with globals</li>
<li>at least in terms of twigils</li>
<li>realized that filehandles belong to the <code>PROCESS</code> namespace, not the <code>GLOBAL</code> namespace</li>
<li>continuing on the vein of <code>.Whatever</code> on most normal operators builds a closure of one argument</li>
<li>made <code>*.method</code> do the same thing</li>
<li>even in places which are not syntactically special, we can use <code>*.prime</code> in a <code>grep</code> for example</li>
<li>equivalent to putting <code>.prime</code> in the curlies</li>
<li>now we have a fairly general mechanism of writing closures of a single argument</li>
<li>actually reads pretty well if you don't want the curlies</li>
<li>we could go as far as to undo the special syntax on <code>when</code>s and <code>~~</code> so you have to say <code>*.foo</code> to call a method</li>
<li>still thinking about that</li>
<li>would regularize the syntax slightly</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>had a little emergency over the weekend, but things are fine</li>
<li>improving Rakudo's build process to make it easier to build</li>
<li>someone who wants to build it can get a copy of the repo and pass a special option to Rakudo's <em>Configure.pl</em></li>
<li>that'll download a copy of Parrot from the right revision and build it for you</li>
<li>people who want to play with Rakudo don't have to play with Parrot dependencies</li>
<li>Jonathan and I have most of the guts ready to start writing <code>Setting</code> code</li>
<li>we can start to write methods in Perl 6 instead of in PIR</li>
<li>we'll gradually migrate methods which make sense to rewrite in Perl 6</li>
<li>moving those over into the <code>Setting</code> code</li>
<li>that'll make it easier for people to hack on</li>
<li>some things will remain in PIR, but we don't know what those are yet</li>
<li>most of my plans for this week is doing more cleanups in the build process</li>
<li>rewriting Rakudo's <em>t/harness</em> to remove dependencies on Parrot files</li>
<li>have that mostly done</li>
<li>writing some articles discussing Rakudo's new home</li>
<li>how to get it, how to build it, and updating websites</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>working on Parrot's install process</li>
<li>making it so that Patrick doesn't have to build and install a whole copy of Parrot to build Rakudo</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we'll need that for some time</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>trying to make it so that people who build and install packages have an easier time</li>
<li>you won't have to depend on a Parrot build directory</li>
<li>you can run against an installed Parrot</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I would like to get rid of the build tree dependency</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the patch I have gets rid of most of the build tree dependencies</li>
<li>there are a few header files in weird locations</li>
<li>they don't get included in PMCs and dynops</li>
<li>I've fixed all of the build tools</li>
<li>all that's left is C-level stuff</li>
<li>should probably send you to the patch to experiment with</li>
<li>lots of stuff preparing for the release</li>
<li>seems to be encouraging that we've been getting more novice questions</li>
<li>seems to be an influx of interest here</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>talking to Richard Blackwell about YAPC</li>
<li>Parrot and Perl 6 hackathon needs</li>
<li>working on TODO/SKIP test review for Parrot</li>
<li>also pondering bug triaging guidelines for Parrot</li>
<li>having some discussions about release policies and deprecations (though mostly Perl 5)</li>
<li>setting expectations early seems to help a lot</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>what projects did you look at, or did you look at things afresh?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Subversion's really early milestone release process was a real inspiration</li>
<li>the Linux kernel's backwards compatibility policy was also</li>
<li>not much besides that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Ubuntu's long term support is pretty nice</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm a little less thrilled there</li>
<li>even six months time is a long span between releases</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's kind of a corporate support guideline</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I like knowing that Hardy will be supported for a few years</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's a risk for them</li>
<li>how long are they going to support KDE 3 when upstream doesn't?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>RHEL and other enterprise distributions support Perl 5.8 until 2011 or so</li>
<li>but we haven't heard anything from downstream there</li>
<li>and we only support critical security fixes there</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I put in expicit language about vendors promising long-term security fixes</li>
<li>that's your vendor's problem, not the problem of volunteers</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>in Perl 5, you used to do <code>package;</code> with no namespace</li>
<li>removed somewhere in 5.8.x</li>
<li>was such a thing considered for Perl 6?</li>
<li>you basically banned all unqualified variables</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it was a hack in Perl 5</li>
<li>I want to make new mistakes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I expect to do Rakudo's next release next Wednesday</li>
<li>that's a target anyway</li>
<li>I'll be out of town this weekend</li>
<li>we'll start its regular release clock with that release</li>
<li>we'll do monthly releases</li>
<li>that exact date will vary by a few days here or there until we get the release process down</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>will you have a similar release structure as Parrot</li>
<li>multiple release managers?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>yes</li>
<li>I don't want to be the single release manager</li>
<li>I'll probably do the first couple</li>
<li>I want at least one other person to do some by May or June</li>
<li>ideally a team</li>
<li>the Rakudo release needs to happen very quickly after the Parrot release</li>
<li>we won't be able to do this this month</li>
<li>what do we need to think about for POD in Perl 6?</li>
<li>what we have now is "DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT"</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>can you say "We'll target this version and update if necessary?"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's exactly what I've done so far</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I agree</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I expect to generate or write a fair bit of POD</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's amenable to mechanical translation</li>
<li>someone should write a standard parser for POD</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Parrot might as well stick with the standard</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>are you suggesting a Parrot-based POD6 parser?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>if you develop a POD6 parser in Perl 6, could we compile it back down to PIR and use it?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we'd more likely target NQP</li>
<li>Rakudo expects the Perl 6 runtime available</li>
<li>it'd be nice to say that that's just a PBC, but it's also PMCs and dynops</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>makes me wonder how small we can make a Parrot distribution that only contains NQP as a language</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's the Parrot 2 proposal</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I meant ripping out all ops and PMCs you don't need</li>
<li>maybe no IMCC</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's not PBC compatible though</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>he's talking about a version of Parrot built on as few basic opcodes as possible</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>no PMCs or ops written in C</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I thought the computer scientists proved that you only need one operation to make things work, sort of a compare and jump</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>then you have Lisp</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>but you need infinite storage space</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>disk space is cheap, and getting cheaper</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>but not infinite</li>
<li>you can climb that asymptote all you want, but it keeps getting steeper</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the ultimate slippery slope argument</li>
</ul></p>
