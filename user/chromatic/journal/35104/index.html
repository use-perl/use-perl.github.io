<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met on 12 December 2007 by phone.  Allison, Patrick, Will, Jerry, Jesse, Richard, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it looks possible that I could meet up with Flavio in Europe after FOSDEM at the end of February</li>
<li>we're talking on IRC</li>
<li>things are going really well</li>
<li>I managed to convert Pynie to the new compiler tools on the plane last weekend</li>
<li>four forty-minute chunks were enough to do it, plus some time in the airport</li>
<li>mostly answering questions and helping people convert various languages over to the new toolkit</li>
<li>Perl 6 has some more passing tests and new features</li>
<li>we're getting the features passed in a correct manner that matches the intent of the spec</li>
<li>removing some of the previous workarounds</li>
<li>I'm happy about that</li>
<li>we've had some discussions about coordinating between kp6 and this effort</li>
<li>we're going to see if we can get kp6 to target NQP</li>
<li>it's been a very full week; refer to my journal</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>converted Punie to NQP</li>
<li>it's passing some of the tests that were TODO</li>
<li>there are some things in the compiler toolkit that aren't quite ready yet, so I'll block on them</li>
<li>slurpy arguments for example</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll try to get that in there tonight</li>
<li>it's not difficult</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>had some discussions with Flavio and other kp6 developers</li>
<li>we're talking about coordination efforts</li>
<li>Flavio started an NQP backend for kp6 today</li>
<li>it's amazing how similar these things are</li>
<li>we already have the <em>01-tap.t</em> test running on kp6 using NQP</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it sounds like there'll be a fair bit of overlap between these projects</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we'll both be able to target the Parrot backend through the compiler tools</li>
<li>then we can steal information on algorithms and techniques used between the two</li>
<li>eventually converge on a solution</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>how different are the implementations?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm not familiar enough with the internals of kp6 to answer that</li>
<li>Patrick will tell you that kp6 and mp6 inspired NQP earlier</li>
<li>the architectures are somewhat similar</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>one big question in terms of similarity</li>
<li>how does kp6 handle a runtime environment?</li>
<li>NQP doesn't handle one beyond what Parrot does</li>
<li>that depends on how kp6 implements its primitives and what they happen to be</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I need to turn my attention back to Perl 6</li>
<li>definitely busy with these three implementations</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I think I fixed the concurrency bug from last week</li>
<li>a threading deadlock only present in MP machines</li>
<li>it came down to a wake signal getting sent too early for the sleeping thread to catch it</li>
<li>waiting for confirmation from people with affected machines</li>
<li>did check in the last bits of the event handler code</li>
<li>pretty much the last task of that</li>
<li>just need to switch the capturing of low-level signals from the old event thread to the new concurrency scheduler thread</li>
<li>that'll be the end of that implementation</li>
<li>next is the MMD PDD</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>is that still on target for the 15th, or will you push that back?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it'll be a couple of days after the 15th, but it won't be much longer than that</li>
<li>it takes about three days to do a good solid PDD</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>fixed a couple of nasty Parrot bugs</li>
<li>one in the concurrency system</li>
<li>tried to implement the <code>copy</code> opcode, but have some questions</li>
<li>also still planning to implement the scheduling algorithm, unless Allison has finished it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's a naive queue right now</li>
<li>not needed until we add other things to the scheduler</li>
<li>but it'll get used when you add it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll cut the 0.5.1 release next Tuesday, so Allison can do real work</li>
<li>we have six release managers for next year, so the schedule will come out along with the release</li>
<li>minor cleanup in the tree too</li>
<li>that's about it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Richard:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>TPF officially accepted Patrick's work for the past month</li>
<li>we reported that to the Mozilla Foundation too</li>
<li>made a public announcement on news.perlfoundation.org</li>
<li>very happy to release that good news to the world</li>
<li>spending some time looking for hackathon sponsors</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>let me bring up the question about the <code>copy</code> operator</li>
<li>it's not clear how to know which pieces of a PMC to copy</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's why I suggested the use of <code>clone</code> in my original proposal</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we need a <code>clone</code> that reuses a header</li>
<li>we probably also need to call <code>destroy</code> to handle any deallocation, or we may have unreachable memory</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>as long as all <code>destroy</code>s behave properly and just deallocate things</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we have a nice separation between destruction and deallocation, so well-behaved ones should be fine</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>maybe the right way to refactor this is to say that <code>copy</code> takes an existing header and does the copy</li>
<li><code>clone</code> creates a new header and does the copy</li>
<li>certainly easier than updating every PMC's <code>assign</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's a flash of insight, so I'll try that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm so glad you're doing that and not me</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I get that a lot</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm so glad you're doing Perl 6, Patrick</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Richard:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>can I just say that I've been watching the discussions between particle, Patrick, and Flavio and I'm impressed at the forward progress?</li>
