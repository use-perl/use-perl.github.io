Random thoughts.
</p>
<p>
This <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2002/01/17/slash_plugin.html">article</a> turned out to be around 6000 words, 4800 of which were written in a single day.  Ouch.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.cwinters.com/">Chris Winters</a> wants me to put Text::WikiFormat up on the CPAN soon.  First, I have to get the name past people like Jarkko, Tim, and Skud.  Yow.
</p>
<p>
Since <a href="http://oostendorp.net/">nate</a> moved <a href="http://everydevel.com/">Everything</a> to <a href="http://sf.net/projects/everydevel/">SourceForge</a>, I'm now a developer on it again.  The first step?  Comprehensive unit tests.  I've got religion, baby.
</p>
<p>
I have a phone interview with the Dallas company tomorrow afternoon (today, if you go by GMT, which I generally don't).  Another possibility has started to consider to begin to present itself, and it's not in Dallas.  That has pluses and minuses.
</p>
<p>
I decided that no matter how much you care, friends who make a habit of stupid and hurtful decisions aren't trustworthy until they start making better choices.  Knowing that I'm being wise doesn't make me feel any better about it.  Knowing that several other friends kept trying to convince me of it does, but just a little.
</p>
<p>
The general consensus seems to be that I look better in my normal street clothes (t-shirt, jeans, leather jacket) than in a tuxedo.  I'll save the rental fee next time.  How many other best men wear a t-shirt with a glow-in-the-dark alien head on it?
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.perl-foundation.org/">Perl Foundation</a> website runs on software I helped write.  I just noticed.
</p>
<p>
(stream-of-consciousness: I write valid XHTML even in my journal.  How... perfect?)

It seems like every web site I know that uses Everything is linked pretty directly in some way to Blockstackers personnel<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...

<p>
<a href="http://javajunkies.org/" title="javajunkies.org">Java Junkies</a javajunkies.org> isn't.  Given the traffic on EveryDevel, there must be a few other sites that aren't run by BSI -- but the SourceForge Foundry is (if you count nate), and that's the only other one that comes to mind.
</p>
<p>
I don't really understand that -- it's a nice Engine and it's easy to do cool things, but it seems to be stigmatized into "only good for Everything2" and "only good for Perl Monks", just like Slash is "only good for Slashdot".  Face it, we're pioneers.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Everyone knows Slash rules and everything else sucks!
<br>
<br>Seriously, though, I think most people think Everything is just harder to use and understand.  "All this node stuff?  WTF?"  Plus, they don't really evangelize it much, if at all, to the general public.
