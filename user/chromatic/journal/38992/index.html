<div class="span8">
<p><p>This week's release of Parrot 1.2 and Rakudo #17 include some measurable performance improvements.  We've spent the last couple of weeks profiling and tuning Parrot.  In particular, Parrot startup is a third of what it was in Parrot 1.1 (building on the work in <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/chromatic/journal/38931">Silly Little Parrot Optimizations</a>).  Rakudo's parsing speed has improved by at least 40% (though perhaps we've halved the time the average parse takes).  Parrot's method dispatching speed has improved by about 10%.  Returning from simple functions (that is, creating and invoking a return continuation rather than storing a first-class continuation) is also somewhat faster, but I don't have my notes on exact numbers.</p>

<p>A few other optimizations didn't make it in the release.  I've just created a quick patch to reduce the cost of function invocations (perhaps a 30% improvement there), and I'm experimenting with some modest changes to those places where we do need to <code>malloc()</code> explicitly.</p>

<p>This is minor tuning, based on careful profiling, a few algorithmic improvements, moving runtime calculations to compile time, and an increasing knowledge of hotspots and expensive code.  Few of them require non-local design changes to Parrot.  We have much more impressive performance improvements in the works.</p>

<p>(This is about Perl programming, not <a href="http://www.rapideuphoria.com/">Euphoria programming</a>.)</p></p>
