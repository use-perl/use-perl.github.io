<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 22 April 2009.  Allison, Jerry, Will, Patrick, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>worked mainly on the book this week</li>
<li>reviewing patches, preparing for the release</li>
<li>did more work on the calling conventions branch</li>
<li>you have to update all of the last scattered bits throughout the cold</li>
<li>gave a talk to the SF LUG last night</li>
<li>good questions there</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>worked on GSoC</li>
<li>TPF has nine slots this year</li>
<li>two projects are for Parrot and one is for Perl 6</li>
<li>we originally had 10, but one student had duplicate proposals into another organization</li>
<li>all of the mentors and students are excited and ready to go</li>
<li>we're looking forward to the start of coding in May</li>
<li>getting everyone set up with the proper credentials and prerequisites for commits</li>
<li>will have a good amount of time to the Perl 6 command line in the near future</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>spent the last week at the Nordic Perl Workshop and a subsequent hackathon</li>
<li>the workshop was excellent and well-organized</li>
<li>a two-day track for Perl 6 and Parrot</li>
<li>quite a bit of enthusiasm from attendees about Perl 6 and Parrot</li>
<li>the initial guesses about attendance were wrong; we had to switch to bigger rooms for the Perl 6 stuff</li>
<li>LinPro sponsored the three-day hackathon</li>
<li>it went extremely well</li>
<li>Larry and I attended Gabor's Perl 6 introduction</li>
<li>I wanted to see where people would have trouble with Rakudo and the like</li>
<li>other people worked on various modules in Perl 6</li>
<li>we now have socket support in Rakudo</li>
<li>people can write web servers and clients in pure Perl 6, no PIR</li>
<li>quite a few people asked for something to do</li>
<li>we gave them challenges that they might not be able to complete</li>
<li>most of them all worked out though</li>
<li>we found lots of little bigs</li>
<li>we found some conceptual problems</li>
<li>we implemented a lot of new features</li>
<li>I worked with Gabor on integration of syntax highlighting of Rakudo in Padre</li>
<li>PCT now provides the information Padre needs</li>
<li>any PCT-based language could quickly get syntax highlighting through Padre</li>
<li>that works out very well</li>
<li>it took some time to get the design right, but Gabor took it from there and started doing amazing things</li>
<li>Jonathan and I cornered Larry on some issues</li>
<li>we kept asking him with hard questions and frustrated him with our ideas</li>
<li>at one point, he started banging his shoe on the table to get our attention</li>
<li>the <code>prefix:=</code> operator is gone -- iterate an iterator operator</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm going to miss the prefix fish operator!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm going to write about it</li>
<li>when we were trying to nail down laziness in Perl 6 and its meaning, we realized that prefix:<code>&lt;=&gt;</code> was trying to solve two different problems</li>
<li>they're contextually related</li>
<li>but multidispatch makes getting context information more difficult</li>
<li>people in the tutorial found the syntax ugly, especially in a scalar assignment</li>
<li>reading a single line from a POD filehandle was even uglier: <code>my $x = =$=podhandle;</code></li>
<li>it's now <code>.get</code> for a single item and <code>.lines</code> to read in list context</li>
<li>that makes the code much easier to read in general</li>
<li>the fish operator is now <code>lines()</code></li>
<li>it's more readable for people who don't know Perl</li>
<li>as Masak has previously noted, whenever someone mentions the need for something (the desire for golf or obfuscation), he says "There will be modules."</li>
<li>we managed to put Larry's ideas about binding in place</li>
<li>that's been difficult in Parrot with PCT and PMCs as currently designed</li>
<li>I think things look better and simpler for us now</li>
<li>Larry seemed declined to support some things we thought we might have to support, in particular certain binding features</li>
<li>we'll clean up the binding syntax in Rakudo over the next couple of months</li>
<li>Jonathan and I spent one evening reviewing and updating the Copenhagen roadmap</li>
<li>I'll turn that into some readable prose</li>
<li>we'll have tha sometime this week</li>
<li>Jonathan finished his grant review and is waiting review from his grant manager</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>oh, I know what that means...</li>
<li>I'll get to that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>he's busy working on his next grant proposal</li>
<li>we spent a good amount of time clarifying things so he could finish up his grant</li>
<li>that largely happened at the hackathon</li>
<li>we made some PGE improvements</li>
<li>one participant was interested in quantifiers, so he did some of the hard parts of figuring out how to parse regexp quantifiers</li>
<li>fixed that in a few hours one day</li>
<li>a feature for people writing parsers</li>
<li>that closed a couple of RTs</li>
<li>I'll post in detail about the hackathon happenings in the next couple of days</li>
<li>it was very productive</li>
<li>lots of good energy from the participants</li>
<li>we had at least five or six people just hacking with Rakudo Perl</li>
<li>someone put together a pretty good XML parser</li>
<li>we also talked quite a bit about module distribution for Perl 6</li>
<li>no concrete plans, just broad brushstrokes</li>
<li>we're looking at something more distributed, like Git and GitHub</li>
<li>Masak has something in the works with his Proto module</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>CPAN solves uploading and mirroring</li>
<li>it doesn't solve the distro problem as much</li>
<li>mapping uploads to different people and such</li>
<li>how do you lay things out on disk and figure out how to load them?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we didn't get to that level of detail</li>
<li>we're keeping it in mind as we go on</li>
<li>it'll come up sometime over the summer</li>
<li>very likely a YAPC::EU topic</li>
<li>working on Rakudo's release</li>
<li>expect to get that done in the next few hours</li>
<li>a little early, as we have several pending patches</li>
<li>no reason to hold the release in that case</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Perl 6 released early!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>~3190 new passing tests since the last release</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>let's see you do that next month!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's 100 a day</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>2100 were Unicode tests</li>
<li>that's still over 1000 tests in the past month</li>
<li>several people asked how to port the stuff I did from Rakudo back into PGE</li>
<li>even without Unicode, it was a significant month</li>
<li>we'll have trouble matching this month's progress</li>
<li>we're passing tests people have already written</li>
<li>but people are adding new tests</li>
<li>the size of the test suite is growing</li>
<li>we're catching up</li>
<li>I'm almost to the point where we should look not at absolute numbers but at the percentage of the test suite</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that number's more meaningful externally</li>
<li>are you above or below 50%?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we're above 60%</li>
<li>100% is a receding number though</li>
<li>some parts of the spec are woefully undertested</li>
<li>the next big chunk is fixing named argument passing</li>
<li>we can't handle all of those in the right way all of the time</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Parrot 1.1 came out yesterday</li>
<li>general station keeping with coding standards tests and ticket wrangling</li>
<li>I think I fixed an IMCC bug which blocked lexicals with Unicode names</li>
<li>was a blocker for Rakudo</li>
<li>hope to steal some of Allison's energy to get Partcl building against an installed Parrot</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>merged in some of the header cleanup work</li>
<li>have a lot left to go</li>
<li>will be editing the Parrot book in hopes of publishing it very soon</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the PASM chapter has a lot of bad code in it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm working on it now</li>
</ul></p>
