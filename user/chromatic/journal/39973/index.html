<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 18 November 2009.  Larry, Allison, Patrick, Jerry, Will, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>adding new features to NQP</li>
<li>checked in a copy to the Parrot repository</li>
<li>added the ability to create empty lists and hashes</li>
<li>added floating point constants</li>
<li>added array flattening into positional arguments</li>
<li>added statement modifiers</li>
<li>S05 changed with regard to subrule aliasing; updated NQP for that</li>
<li>so glad I created a new regex engine for this</li>
<li>that would have been difficult to do in PGE while maintaining backward compatibility</li>
<li>moved expression parsing closer to Perl 6</li>
<li>cleaned up literal handling</li>
<li>added the ability to have contextual variables look in global namespace and dynamic caller stack</li>
<li>simplified ability to set variables in other namespaces</li>
<li>continuing to bring Rakudo-ng branch up to feature parity with master</li>
<li>we'll release the Rakudo master tomorrow</li>
<li>mostly the same as October, but it uses the new Parrot calling conventions</li>
<li>spent my time working on the Rakudo-ng branch</li>
<li>we now have pointy blocks</li>
<li>updated to S05 interpretation</li>
<li>can parse numbers with decimal points</li>
<li>they produce <code>Rat</code>s, not <code>Float</code>s, but I'm waiting for the spec to settle there</li>
<li>needs some cleaning anyway</li>
<li>statement modifiers now work</li>
<li>implemented <code>Nil</code>, after extensive discussion with Larry</li>
<li>works really well as an empty <code>Parcel</code></li>
<li>implemented the <code>.map</code> method for lists</li>
<li>this version is lazy and can handle lazy lists</li>
<li>Jonathan and I updated dotty method operators to work correctly</li>
<li>still more to do there</li>
<li>worked on getting exported methods into a place where they're globally visible</li>
<li>currently they export themselves into the global namespace</li>
<li>works out pretty well</li>
<li>wrote a milestone report; completed the first half of my Hague grant milestones</li>
<li>should finish the rest of the grant by the end of the year</li>
<li>Jonathan's doing his amazing work on getting Rakudo pieces back in place</li>
<li>concentrating on method calls and class handling</li>
<li>we'll work on that through the next week</li>
<li>we'll pass a lot of the spectest suite in the branch by then</li>
<li>it's easy to get things to work</li>
<li>very few blockers in the new branch</li>
<li>most of the slowdowns are places where we were cheating but don't want to cheat anymore</li>
<li>have to do some work to figure out what the right approach is</li>
<li>started working on a new version of Partcl based on NQP</li>
<li>it's in the early stages, but it's worth trying to help Will there</li>
<li>so far it looks very promising</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>working on tickets and small tasks this week</li>
<li>have no RT tickets left in my name</li>
<li>there are no RT tickets left at all</li>
<li>Will did a lot of fantastic work closing, rejecting, and migrating them</li>
<li>next week, I may work more on Pynie</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>a bit under the weather this week</li>
<li>clarified the <code>Nil</code> semantics of empty blocks and missing branches</li>
<li>straightened up the <code>Nil</code> semantics for Patrick, as to what it actually is</li>
<li>the spec allowed a few of the phaser blocks to be statements instead</li>
<li>we opened that up to be almost all of them</li>
<li>they're now <em>blorst</em> -- block-or statements</li>
<li>Damian suggested we find some way of renaming those to <em>blast</em>, so we can have phaser blasts</li>
<li>unfortunately, they're block-or, not block-and</li>
<li>but maybe we can force that anyway</li>
<li>hankered for several months on this next one</li>
<li>when you alias a rule in the grammar, it does not suppress the original capture</li>
<li>people who wanted to give multiple aliases to an existing rule had to repeat it</li>
<li>that made sense in the original rule capture conception</li>
<li>after we added the dot form to suppress capture, it became easy to suppress a capture and alias a the same time</li>
<li><code>foo=bar</code> in an assertion gives you both foo and bar in a capture</li>
<li>you say <code>foo=.bar</code> to suppress the capture</li>
<li>removed <code>:panic</code> last week</li>
<li>turned out to please the crowd</li>
<li>decided to execute <code>:keepall</code> this week</li>
<li>it's not very powerful, and it duplicates the semantics of <code>.caps</code> and <code>.chunks</code></li>
<li>thinking a lot about <code>Rat</code>s, as Patrick mentioned</li>
<li>design-wise, they consisted of a numerator and denominator of the same type</li>
<li>frequently you want a larger numerator than a denominator</li>
<li>settled on that as a normal thing</li>
<li>the default <code>Rat</code> type, even though it still has a 64-bit denominator, is just an <code>Int</code> on top</li>
<li>added a <code>FatRat</code>, a <code>Rational</code> with arbitrary precision on both numerator and denominator</li>
<li>easy to get in trouble that way, performance-wise</li>
<li>as Moritz suggested, <code>Rat</code> types are instantiations of the <code>Rational</code> role with the two types in question</li>
<li>Damian pointed out that <code>STASH</code> was the only type in all caps</li>
<li>changed that to <code>Stash</code> for consistency</li>
<li>Damian also pointed out that the <code>CONTEXT</code> pseudo-package was confusing</li>
<li>a singular noun implies one thing, even though it searches upward the dynamic stack</li>
<li>it's now <code>DYNAMIC</code></li>
<li>individual frames are now <code>Context</code>; we distinguished them</li>
<li>worked on <code>Rat</code> normalization</li>
<li>they do not have negatives in the denominator</li>
<li>conversion to <code>String</code> now looks to see if the denominator is factorable into only twos and fives</li>
<li>if so, converts to straight decimal output</li>
<li>if not, it converts to a <code>Numeric</code> form in the <code>String</code> case</li>
<li>in the <code>.perl</code> case, it converts to the slash form</li>
<li>if it can convert conveniently into a decimal form, it does so directly</li>
<li>unbroke the check yada (bitrotted)</li>
<li>thus STD now allows forward-declaration of classes and subs</li>
<li>rearranged integer capture for Patrick, but he said he didn't need it</li>
<li>improved consistency of literal rules</li>
<li>changed to the new capturing/aliasing notation</li>
<li>fixed up the new blorsts</li>
<li>added a new <code>Parcel</code> type to <code>CORE</code></li>
<li>thinking about the literal formats</li>
<li>a bad problem turned up with negated complex literals</li>
<li>they had a different meaning than if they weren't literals, in terms of negating the imaginary part</li>
<li>prototyped adding the pluses and minuses into the literal parts</li>
<li>thinking of going the other way</li>
<li>there is no literal form of complexes; always formed by constant folding</li>
<li>with recent changes to the semantics of angle brackets, a single literal inside angle brackets would recognize the literal forms we're getting away from</li>
<li>we could use angle brackets to emphasize the literalness of these forms</li>
<li>some performance ramifications to putting signs in literal rules</li>
<li>interactions with different sets of rules to apply to user input is questionable</li>
<li>that could run things you don't want to run in a tainting fashion</li>
<li>may be wise to separate literal parsing from the grammar's notion of literals</li>
<li>beyond that, working out the semantics of numification and stringification</li>
<li>when we want a basic version of those (give me this type) and otherwise (give me something that does this role)</li>
<li>the <code>+</code> operators probably do abstract numification, where it picks the type you want</li>
<li>if you say <code>.Num</code>, you get a <code>Num</code></li>
<li>if you say <code>.Rat</code>, you get a <code>Rat</code></li>
<li>Moritz pointed out inconsistent specs with regard to stringification and type objects</li>
<li>we expected them to stringify to the name, with parentheses, but other places expected them to stringify to nothing</li>
<li>if the internal uses of <code>.str</code> are low-level, inside <code>say</code> or <code>print</code>, we can make that one print the actual name</li>
<li><code>say Type.WHAT</code> will give you the name so you can see it</li>
<li>most of the places we do abstract strings, we want to stringify</li>
<li>if <code>~</code> does the concatenation, we can have it check for undef, return null string, and give a warning</li>
<li>that maps to the use cases pretty well</li>
<li>most coercion operations probably want to use the abstract coercion</li>
<li>maybe</li>
<li>also probably removing <code>is ref</code> in favor of backslash</li>
<li>haven't specced that yet</li>
<li>want to play with the importation syntax</li>
<li>tag set notation is clunky</li>
<li>thinking about how to track foldability</li>
<li>what can you consider a literal, from a grammar point of view</li>
<li>otherwise, bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>talked with Patrick about converting Partcl to NQP-rx</li>
<li>answering questions about that</li>
<li>hopefully Patrick will do all of the work</li>
<li>pushing people to close old tickets from RT</li>
<li>we can finally use Trac for everything now</li>
<li>now we have 600 Trac tickets to close</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>fixed some bugs</li>
<li>working on medium term planning</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>are you releasing NQP-rx regularly?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I planned to make a new release a week before the Parrot release</li>
<li>didn't work out this way this week</li>
<li>it's evolving too quickly</li>
<li>but that's still the plan</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>will Parrot get a new NQP release in the Parrot releases?</li>
<li>sounds like yes, unless a language on Parrot needs a critical bugfix between the merge and the release</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>right</li>
<li>NQP will be very stable in the next month or two</li>
<li>already has most of the features I ever want to add</li>
<li>still has a couple of regex features I need to add</li>
<li>expect it to be stable before Parrot 2.0</li>
<li>could be wrong, as people jump to use it</li>
<li>but that was the point, and we'll see</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>blast</em> could be BLocks, Alternatively STatements</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>blast</em> is far less ugly than <em>blorst</em></li>
</ul></p>
