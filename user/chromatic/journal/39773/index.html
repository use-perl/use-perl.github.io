<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 16 September 2009.  Larry, Patrick, Jerry, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>mostly worked on my open source ecology talk</li>
<li>backlogging after the return from family trips</li>
<li>pushing a slideshow of Guy Steele about the implementation of easily parallelized data structures</li>
<li>talking over that with Daniel Ruoso</li>
<li>helping Matthew Wilson bootstrap his JS emitter for STD</li>
<li>not much spec hacking, except a conjecture about the parallel semantics</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>released Parrot 1.6.0</li>
<li>went very smoothly</li>
<li>really like how boring it was</li>
<li>due to release Rakudo 21 tomorrow</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>mostly a lot of thinking this week</li>
<li>protoregexes in PGE, for example</li>
<li>reran the spectest progress file since the last release</li>
<li>Moritz and others greatly improved the calculation of the test suite size</li>
<li>previously it looked as if the suite were shrinking, due to <code>plan</code> lines</li>
<li>the curve is more accurate since August</li>
<li>Rakudo now passes over 15,000 tests -- almost 15,500</li>
<li>substantial increase since August</li>
<li>most of those tests are of operators on Nums, Rats, and Ints</li>
<li>lots of transcendental functions</li>
<li>I claim very little credit other than getting the process started</li>
<li>turned on HLL mapping for converting Parrot Floats into Rakudo Nums</li>
<li>in some places, Parrot Float internals leaked out</li>
<li>passed more tests, didn't seem to take a speed hit in the spec tests</li>
<li>that wasn't true with Int and String before</li>
<li>haven't seen direct reports of slowdowns from anyone else</li>
<li>will be able to focus all of my energy in Rakudo and NQP over the weekend</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Leon pointed me to a link about <a href="http://renesd.blogspot.com/2009/09/py3kpython3-more-than-one-year-on-096.html">Python 3's uptake a year later</a></li>
<li>only about 1% of registered Python packages support Python 3</li>
<li>they originally had a <em>2to3</em> script to help migrate forward</li>
<li>now they also have a <em>3to2</em> script to encourage people to write in the new version</li>
<li>interesting to see how one version is more important than the other</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we already have a couple of those already</li>
<li>it's what <code>kp6</code> was</li>
<li>it's what STD with <code>gimme5</code> does</li>
<li>what I'm trying to bootstrap on <code>viv</code> is</li>
<li>the problem is that Perl 5 engine isn't actually capable of supporting the Perl 6 semantics on the bare metal, as it were</li>
<li>you either do emulation on top of Perl 5</li>
<li>or use cheaters on the innards of Perl 5 to sneak the required semantics in</li>
<li>both of those have their downsides</li>
<li>code that uses one approach is not interoperable with code that uses a different approach</li>
<li>neither of them are strictly interoperable with standard Perl 5 code</li>
<li>STD does regexp matching, but it doesn't use P5 regexps to do it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it writes out Perl 5 code to do it longhand?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>yes</li>
<li>if you've seen Damian's recent talk on getting the P5 regexp engine to store trees...</li>
<li>he had to go through contortions to make that work</li>
<li>it's not extensible in the way that P6 regexps are</li>
<li>it's only part of the way there</li>
<li>it probably has other bugs</li>
<li>STD has that emulation layer on top</li>
<li>getting that to smoothly stitch Perl 6 code back to Perl 5 as if it were Perl 5....</li>
<li>it may be possible at the subroutine boundary, but that's about it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it might have all of the fun of using cfront, then eventually the C compiler chokes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>any time you do multiple passes, you set yourself up for various dislocations</li>
<li>most of them painful</li>
<li>even so, STD is written in a subset of Perl 6 amenable to backtranslation</li>
<li>using that subset of Perl 6 as a better Perl 5 will take you only so far and no further</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>fixed bugs</li>
<li>improved performance</li>
<li>1.6 should be faster than 1.4, measurably</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I have trouble measuring that</li>
<li>but my gut agrees</li>
<li>we keep doing things in Rakudo that should slow things down</li>
<li>but it doesn't get slower</li>
<li>I just can't measure it</li>
<li>the number of tests per second stays relatively flat</li>
<li>Jerry, did you try a practice run of the release?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>hope to do that tonight</li>
<li>started reading the release manager guide</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's straightforward</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's in English, which helps</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's similar to the Parrot steps</li>
<li>do a practice release in your own GitHub account</li>
<li>the steps are the same as if you were doing a real release</li>
</ul></p>
