<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 08 April 2008.  Larry, Allison, Patrick, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>goofed off most of last week at Harvard, MIT, Yale, Columbia, and Bloomberg</li>
<li>all the talks seemed to be well-received</li>
<li>squeezed in a little bit of sight-seeing</li>
<li>spent a lot of time thinking about things people are uncertain about</li>
<li>particularly the big discussion of junctions</li>
<li>finally decided to do something conservative</li>
<li>said "Don't rely on anything fancy for 6.0"</li>
<li>still thinking about comparisons</li>
<li>how fail-soft they ought to be on type mismatches and undefined values</li>
<li>how that relates to various contexts, such as sorting and parallel operations that want to suppress exception throwing</li>
<li>thinking about the semantics of <code>leave</code> and if we can nail that down</li>
<li>or if each implementation will have to decide how primitive that is</li>
<li>I think of it as unwinding the stack to a known point</li>
<li>that's independent than throwing exceptions</li>
<li>less primitive than falling off the end of a function</li>
<li>more primitive than <code>return</code>, or anything that decides to unwind the stack</li>
<li>there are variants of <code>leave</code> on other kinds of objects that probably <em>are</em> implemented in terms of throwing an exception</li>
<li>maybe we're confusing some contexts</li>
<li>looked at some of the <code>split</code> discussion</li>
<li>we should not have to inspect the pattern to look for captures</li>
<li>there's now an <code>:all</code> flag which returns captured delimiters as well as intermediaries in the <code>split</code></li>
<li>looked at <code>join</code></li>
<li>the usages kept assuming it assumed to join on the null string</li>
<li>seems like a danger flag to me</li>
<li>nowhere in the test suite did it use the default-to-space behavior, since string coercion defaults to that anyway</li>
<li>now defaults to the null string, which is more in line with expectations</li>
<li>revised the test suite for that</li>
<li>I believe Rakudo follows that now</li>
<li>renamed <code>Str.reverse</code> to <code>flip</code></li>
<li>the long list of tests that tried to finesse what's a string and what isn't is no longer necessary</li>
<li>redefined the <code>reverse</code> operation on hashes to return a list of pairs</li>
<li>you can use those in more than one way</li>
<li>there's also a <code>push</code> method on hashes</li>
<li>pushes values onto a list if you have multiple keys</li>
<li>various wrinkles having to do with if you reverse something whose values are arrays</li>
<li>breaks those out into reverse pairs, to try to preserve round-tripping</li>
<li>hacked STD to allow the new <code>flip</code> operator</li>
<li>fixed a bug in the unrecognized quote operator to give the correct name</li>
<li>helpful if you try to use a single quote without a space</li>
<li>cross operators now treated as non-diffy; it was being too restrictive</li>
<li>also hacked on the 32x32 Camelia</li>
<li>some of the smaller icons need hand drawing</li>
<li>at some point, you want to switch to vector based</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Jonathan did several things</li>
<li>he's closing up his Hague grant</li>
<li>we now have working parameterized roles in Rakudo</li>
<li>they work more than they used to</li>
<li>we can do MMD based on a parameterized type</li>
<li>I've worked on a lot of PGE-related things</li>
<li>also some code generation in PCT</li>
<li>added an opcode to Parrot to search the lexical contexts of callers</li>
<li>not just the outer context</li>
<li>PGE and PCT can start to use contextual variables</li>
<li>that simplifies a lot of things in both PGE and PCT</li>
<li>the code generator in PCT puts in bytecode annotations to tie the generated code back to the HLL code</li>
<li>now we can have real error messages about the HLL code, instead of a PIR location</li>
<li>it doesn't actually report yet, but we have the data stored to report</li>
<li>set up more Unicode stuff</li>
<li>for the time being, it's a dynop in Rakudo</li>
<li>seemed like the easiest way to start</li>
<li>primarily giving regexps the ability to recognize Unicode character properties</li>
<li>will add about 1000 new passing spectests today</li>
<li>possibly more, but up to 1000 now</li>
<li>we <em>could</em> break 10,000 passing tests</li>
<li>also getting Rakudo to recognize regexps as regexps</li>
<li>currently they're just Parrot subs</li>
<li>trying to turn them into a <code>Regex</code> type so we can multidispatch on them</li>
<li>some of the pieces are in place in PGE and PCT</li>
<li>next week, I'll focus primarily on getting PCT in order</li>
<li>giving presentations at NPW and the hackathon there</li>
<li>working on a roadmap for the next phases of Rakudo</li>
<li>putting together some hackathon activities</li>
<li>will include things that other people can help with</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>mostly worked on ripping out the calling conventions in Parrot</li>
<li>went more smoothly than I thought</li>
<li>wrote the code, hadn't run it</li>
<li>ran it the first time and only had to change three lines to make regular subs work</li>
<li>working on NCI subs now, as it needs different generation</li>
<li>might have that done this week</li>
<li>also working on the Parrot book</li>
<li>it's mostly written, but needs some cleanup</li>
<li>I'm generating a PDF of it, which is progress</li>
<li>started converting Pynie over to Python 3.0</li>
<li>mainly the <code>print</code> statement is all I have left</li>
<li>that's a fairly big change, because every test depends on that, but....</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>cleaning up organization of source code and headers</li>
<li>will clean up some names</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>on calling conventions, will that land for 1.1 or 1.2?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll merge back immediately after 1.1</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>could it be two days after 1.1?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>sure</li>
<li>I want plenty of time to test it before 1.2</li>
<li>but it's not an urgent thing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the Tuesday that Parrot releases, I'll be on a plane coming back from Oslo</li>
<li>on Wednesday, I'll be sleeping</li>
<li>I'll do the release on Thursday</li>
<li>releases are easy</li>
<li>I'll spend some time trying to get Rakudo to build with an installed Parrot</li>
<li>that's a good hackathon target</li>
<li>that might make the release a little more time-consuming, but they're all very fast</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm not changing the interface at all</li>
<li>just changing the internals</li>
<li>should mean fewer segfaults or anything</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I ask because Jonathan and I are eager to look at it to see what we need to do to fix up Rakudo's calling conventions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you might want to take the CallSignature as your only signature</li>
<li>do your own unpacking</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's one reason I asked</li>
<li>we might do that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's just a Capture with a little extra metadata</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Jonathan just discovered the slurpy block 24 hours ago</li>
<li>it's a block argument to a function which occurs either at the beginning of a function or a normal position</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it can come in as an adverbial block</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we can get what we need from named and positional parameters</li>
<li>but asking Parrot to handle the slurpy block might be a bit much</li>
<li>whenever we call a sub in Rakudo now, we pass control to another sub which performs unpacking and type checking</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we have slurpy and named and slurpy named flags</li>
<li>we'll need another option for "just give me the CallSignature straight"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>from a performance perspective on Rakudo's side, we can write a special opcode to do that for us</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm not convinced you'll get speed that way</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's a lengthy PIR sub, so it uses a lot of opcodes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's a simple FSM, because that's cheap</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>what's expensive is copying data around and rediscovering type information</li>
</ul></p>
