<p><p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>mostly glaring at various implementations of tagged DFA algorithms</li>
<li>I want something like that for my lexer</li>
<li>played with the Perl 5 bindings to <a href="http://laurikari.net/tre/">TRE</a> by the person who did the NFA paper</li>
<li>it's buggy</li>
<li>now I'm looking at the equivalent implementation under Haskell, which supposedly fixes these bugs</li>
<li>it's a little less accessible to someone without Haskell-fu</li>
<li>I'd love to have it if someone would hack a Pugs binding for it</li>
<li>might have to translate it to Perl 6 myself</li>
<li>it's possible that I might need to do that anyway</li>
<li>most of these things use a POSIX interface</li>
<li>it's not quite what I want</li>
<li>they're good at telling you which submatches matched where</li>
<li>they're not so efficient at telling you which branch the match took</li>
<li>you end up going back out and looking at the submatches</li>
<li>it already had that information when it matched the thing</li>
<li>in the long run, we'll end up writing it ourself</li>
<li>the tagged DFA knows which transition it makes when it's making it, but throws away the whichness in favor of the POSIX interface</li>
<li>it's very close to what we need to intermix the imperative and declarative worlds of pattern matching</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>are you blocking on anything?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>if someone hacked the interface to TDFA in, I could play with it without having to translate it</li>
<li>it's a slowdown</li>
<li>but if we're going to end up with that algorithm in Perl 6 anyway, it's not really a block</li>
<li>more of a frustration</li>
<li>haven't done anything else that anyone's asked me to do</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>helping with the OO cleanup</li>
<li>there are about 25 failing tests remaining</li>
<li>we're really close</li>
<li>inspired by a question on #parrot this week</li>
<li>looking at the <a href="http://www.vanx.org/archive/wam/wambook.pdf">Warren Abstract Machine</a> (PDF) which underlies most Prolog engines</li>
<li>I wonder if the Perl 6 regex machine alone is enough to implement that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you can certainly play with the backtracking for that</li>
<li>you need something to do the unification for you</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Curtis Poe played with implementing Prolog in Perl 5</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there'll be enough primitives there to do it at one level or another</li>
<li>all you need is a Turing-complete language</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>also working primarily on the object model</li>
<li>we went down from 2000 failing tests to 24 in the past week</li>
<li>we did find at least one GC bug</li>
<li>we decided to wait to merge the object branch until just after the next release</li>
<li>Will might want to do the release earlier</li>
<li>I'll leave that up to him</li>
<li>also working on the Events PDD, which is due next Monday</li>
<li>will finish that in between fixing tests on the PDD15 branch</li>
<li>we've only just started talking about the exceptions implementation</li>
<li>I know Jerry wants to wait to branch until after we roll the PDD15 branch in</li>
<li>we can wait on that</li>
<li>hopefully the changes for the Events PDD won't be too big there</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the exceptions implementation doesn't seem too far off</li>
<li>mostly we're missing definitions of some of the standard exceptions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the exception hierarchy</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's a mess</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I have a feeling we'll change a lot of <code>real_exception()</code> calls to <code>create_exception()</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we're using <code>real_exception()</code> in a lot of places we should be using something internal</li>
<li>that's because <code>internal_exception()</code> doesn't really work</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's more of a cleanup and refactoring</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>mostly worked on the new object model as well</li>
<li>didn't get to everything else I hoped to</li>
<li>they're still on deck</li>
<li>expect to get to them later this week</li>
<li>will finish up the TGE things for PDD15 tonight</li>
<li>hopefully that'll clear up some of the failing tests</li>
<li>then I'll be back to writing the AST PDD</li>
<li>then working on the AST refactor</li>
<li>the codebase is getting smaller, which I like</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>also working on PDD 15</li>
<li>fixed some scary bugs</li>
<li>will work on the OrderedHash problem if there's a test case</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I have one for you</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>poked at Lua, but the code isn't clear enough for me to get good wins there</li>
<li>I broke it pretty badly, but hopefully it'll get better</li>
<li>no checkin there yet</li>
<li>also did some profiling, but inconclusive yet</li>
<li>it'll be easier to profile when languages/perl6 runs completely</li>
<li>I have some ideas</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we had a long discussion of alternate programming styles for PGE yesterday in #parrot</li>
<li>it's not quite OO and not quite procedural</li>
</ul>

<p>A long discussion of continuations, coroutines, and <code>ratchet</code> followed.</p>
