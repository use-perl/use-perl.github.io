<p><blockquote><p>Greetings, my friend. We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives.</p>

<p>Remember, my friend, future events such as these will affect you in the future.</p>

<p>You are interested in the unknown... the mysterious. The unexplainable. That is why you are here. My friend, we cannot keep this a secret any longer. Let us punish the guilty. Let us reward the innocent. My friend, can your heart stand the shocking facts of ....</p></blockquote>

<p>&mdash; "Plan 9 From Outer Space"</p>

<p>On behalf of the Parrot team, I'm proud to announce Parrot 0.9.0
&quot;From Outer Space.&quot; <a href="http://parrot.org/">Parrot</a>
is a virtual machine aimed at running all dynamic languages.</p>

<p>Parrot 0.9.0 is available via <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/parrot">CPAN</a> (soon), or <a
href="http://parrot.org/download/">follow the download instructions</a>.
For those who would like to develop on Parrot, or help develop Parrot itself,
we recommend using <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> on
<a href="https://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/">our source code repository</a> to
get the latest and best Parrot code.</p>

<blockquote><p>Eros: First was your firecracker, a harmless explosive. Then your hand grenade: you began to kill your own people, a few at a time. Then the bomb. Then a larger bomb: many people are killed at one time. Then your scientists stumbled upon the atom bomb, split the atom. Then the hydrogen bomb, where you actually explode the air itself. Now you can arrange the total destruction of the entire universe served by our sun: The only explosion left is the Solarbanite.</p>

<p>Colonel Tom Edwards: You speak of Solarbanite. But just what is it?</p>

<p>Eros: Take a can of your gasoline. Say this can of gasoline is the sun. Now, you spread a thin line of it to a ball, representing the earth. Now, the gasoline represents the sunlight, the sun particles. Here we saturate the ball with the gasoline, the sunlight. Then we put a flame to the ball. The flame will speedily travel around the earth, back along the line of gasoline to the can, or the sun itself. It will explode this source and spread to every place that gasoline, our sunlight, touches. Explode the sunlight here, gentlemen, you explode the universe. Explode the sunlight here and a chain reaction will occur direct to the sun itself and to all the planets that sunlight touches, to every planet in the universe. This is why you must be stopped. This is why any means must be used to stop you. In a friendly manner or as (it seems) you want it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Colonel Tom Edwards: Why, a particle of sunlight can't even be seen or measured.</p>

<p>Eros: Can you see or measure an atom? Yet you can <em>explode</em> one. A ray of sunlight is made up of <em>many</em> atoms!</p>

<p>Jeff Trent: So what if we <em>do</em> develop this Solarbanite bomb? We'd be even a stronger nation than now.</p>

<p>Eros: (with disgust) Stronger. You see? You see? Your stupid minds! Stupid! Stupid!</p></blockquote></p>

<h2>So make install works now?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2009-01-21T23:32:06</h3>
<p>Should this resolve all the problems I was having trying to package 0.8.1/2?</p>

<p>It probably has bugs, but it does resolve many of the problems you had.  Vanilla, reactivate!</p>
