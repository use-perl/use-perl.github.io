<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 05 May 2010.  Larry, Allison, Patrick, Will, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>various spec updates, some major</li>
<li>removed <code>p5=&gt;</code> description because it's not supported in core</li>
<li>deleted <code>self:sort</code> construct because self isn't a real syntactic category</li>
<li>explained Perl patterns in terms of PEGs, and spec'ed tiebreaking rules explicitly</li>
<li>last but not least, finally purveyed the long-threatened revamp of proto to keep routine and method semantics similar</li>
<li>they all now work much more like the multiple dispatch semantics currently used by STD, where we always call the proto first</li>
<li>the proto is then always in charge of the actual multiple dispatch; it can of course delegate that</li>
<li>and the default for a null body corresponds closely to current semantics</li>
<li>in hacking news, the lexer generator mislaid any alternative that was a bare <code>.</code> pattern, so cursor_fate never called its alternative, oops</li>
<li>took me a long time to run that one down, because it resulted in a horrendous backtrack causing mysterious misplaced errors</li>
<li>revamped character class parsing to be more helpful and correct</li>
<li>STD now check a normal regex bracket's innards for old-school character class, and warns if found</li>
<li>added a <code>.looks_like_cclass</code> method to Cursor to detect most accidental uses of P5 ranges</li>
<li>some valid P6 brackets will complain, but the workarounds are easy</li>
<li>just put whitespace on both ends is one way</li>
<li>removed a few of these old-school-ish character classes from STD</li>
<li>changed <code>:tr</code> language to <code>:cc</code> language since character classes share it</li>
<li>(translation pays more attention to ordering, but the language is the same)</li>
<li>turned out parsing character classes discovered issues in STD; various character classes needed to backslash <code>#</code> that would otherwise be a comment</li>
<li>to that end, we now allow <code>\#</code> in character classes instead of misparsing as unspace</li>
<li>if we find an invalid <code>-</code> in a regex, we now presume we're in an old-school character class and fail with a sorry instead of a panic to give the character class code a shot at it</li>
<li>STD now uses <code>~</code> syntax for regex brackets to set <code>$*GOAL</code> correctly</li>
<li>cleaned up recursive panic detection; it was possible to get both false positives and negatives before</li>
<li>STD shouldn't use 'note' to emit a panic inside a suppose because that leaks the message that should be trapped</li>
<li>STD now suppresses duplicate <code>sorry</code> messages more correctly</li>
<li><code>sorry</code> no longer uses <code>panic</code> in a supposition, but dies directly to throw the exception to the suppose's try block</li>
<li>STD now allows subscripts on regex variables so <code>$x[0]</code> isn't taken as a character class; still needs speccing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>can we make them consistent?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>historically S05 has allowed bare arrays to mean interpolation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we've never had a working implementation of that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>a bare <code>@</code> would be illegal</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's currently illegal</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you'd have to backslash it to match part of an email address</li>
<li>it's not like the <code>@</code> alternations are a big deal one way or another</li>
<li>that'd be a little more consistent</li>
<li>I forced it to think of the sigil as <code>$</code> than what it really is</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>after seeing how Jonathan et all did interpolation for quoted strings, I thought we should do the same thing in regexes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>STD now has a partial fix to prevent leakage of <code>::T</code> from role signatures</li>
<li>unfortunately, the current fix will lose signatures of file-scoped generic roles</li>
<li>this probably has to do with not knowing whether we're really going to want a new pad; unfortunately we'd have to look ahead to know that currently</li>
<li>various other minor tweaks and bug fixes in STD and Cursor</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>mostly responding to messages and reports</li>
<li>should be able to get back to coding full-time and online for the next week</li>
<li>plan to resolve the list and closure issues with NQP and Rakudo</li>
<li>will answer other questions and try to keep other people productive</li>
<li>planning for the Rakudo Star release on June</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>busy with the last week of classes</li>
<li>spent most of it writing a little language with PCT</li>
<li>it was easy to use and easy to swap the stages of PCT</li>
<li>I remembered what Patrick did with LOLCODE</li>
<li>also had a discussion of source code control systems</li>
<li>next week should be more productive</li>
<li>need to work more closely with Debian packagers to get packages into Debian</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>cleaning out as many deprecations in Parrot as possible</li>
<li>trying to improve the speed of CodeString after the immutable STRINGs merge</li>
<li>bundling lots of little concats helps</li>
<li>hope to merge in an optimization branch for that by the weekend</li>
<li>want to make that faster or less memory intensive</li>
<li>may require the use of a new StringBuilder for Parrot</li>
<li>hopefully will result in a faster Rakudo build</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I've never seen CodeString take a long time</li>
<li>unless you run into memory problems</li>

* discussion of the StringBuilder PMC *
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>still working on optimizations, particularly CodeString</li>
<li>looking at more PBC and PBC-building optimizations</li>
<li>PBC size went down dramatically and startup improved for Rakudo</li>
<li>should have that much faster for the 2.4 release</li>
<li>will poke at GC tasks starting next week</li>
</ul></p>
