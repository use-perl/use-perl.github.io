<div class="span8">
<p><p>As I see it, there are two poles on a language criterion to make a given program run <em>fast</em>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Write in a language which gives you as much control as possible over the
hardware, which implies fewer opportunities for high-level abstractions (tell
me with a straight face that idiomatic Ocaml code regularly worries about
memory usage to the byte and CPU register usage, for example).</li>

<li>Write in a language with a sufficiently smart runtime optimizer that can remove the penalty for abstractions you don't use (and even some you do).</li>

</ul>

<p>History suggests that the second option is almost always the right choice over time.</p></p>

<h2>distributed optimization</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Eric Wilhelm/">Eric Wilhelm</a> on 2009-04-04T07:26:22</h3>
<p>The second option means that optimization is happening outside of your program.  So, you don't have to maintain the optimization.  But, It also removes a lot of your control over the optimization and takes longer to arrive.</p><p>Can we call that "postmature optimization"?</p>

<h2>False Dichotomy</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2009-04-04T23:05:43</h3>
<p>Dichotomies can be categorized into exactly two types: true dichotomies and false dichotomies.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
</p><p>
This, my friend, is a false dichotomy.
</p><p>
Modern haskell believes strongly in the second option.  It's <i>all</i> about making and reusing the best abstractions, and hoping the compiler can figure it out.  Most don't, ghc often  does, but not always.
</p><p>
The new fad in the haskell community is stream fusion, or writing your code in a pipelined manner that allows a stack of maps and filters to be condensed into a single traversal over an aggregate data type.  Switching out linked lists of characters in favor of C-like "bytestrings" is another popular theme.
</p><p>
What allows a compiler like ghc get C-like performance out of code like this is a liberal sprinkling of compiler hints and writing high level modules that <i>do</i> care about byte level operations.
</p><p>
All compilers (save one[*]) are dumb programs that need a lot of help to figure out how to make performant code.  The question is where, when, how and if its exposes the ability to do bit-level and byte-level tweaks.
</p><p>
*: Any compiler that supports COME FROM cannot be deemed a "dumb" program.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>If the "sufficiently smart compiler" is True Amber and C is "The Courts of Chaos", GHC approaches Avalon.  Now I wonder if Zelazny wrote more about programming than the Kabbalah.</p><p>(For everyone not versed in expert-but-pop SF, I agree that GHC trends toward my second pole, but it certainly hasn't arrived.)</p>
