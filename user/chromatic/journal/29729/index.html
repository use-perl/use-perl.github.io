<p><p>Dear Internet,</p>

<p>If you don't know anything about trademarks and especially don't know the difference between patents, copyright, and trademarks, you have no business talking about how awful it is that one company or another has a trademark over something or other.  You probably have no business having an opinion on the subject.</p>

<p>If you can't tell the difference between a cease-and-desist letter and a lawsuit, you have no business publishing your opinion about legal harassment or such.</p>

<p>If you don't know the finer points of why a company might register a trademark and what that means for other organizations using that trademark within the registered context of that trade, your opinion on any particular trademark is meaningless and worthless and you have no business even considering holding it.</p>

<p>If, despite all of this, you think your opinion still matters because you have a weblog, you're wrong.  Your ignorance makes your opinion irrelevant.  Go learn something, think about it for a while, and maybe then you'll be worth listening to.</p>

<p>Your knee-jerk, uninformed ignorance astounds me.  If you spent a fraction of the time doing a modicum of research that you spent bloviating, perhaps you might advance the state of human knowledge and the intelligence of public discourse even a tiny fraction.</p>

<p>PS - you might also try to contain your reaction to something reasonable.  Save the end-of-the-world rhetoric for something important.</p></p>

But trademarking "Web 2.0" in the context of conferences seems a bit like trademarking "XML" in the context of conferences. People [*] are pissed because now nobody else can hold a Web 2.0 conference without calling it something nobody would recognise.<br><br>What would you suggest other people call their Web 2.0 conferences?<br><br>[*] I actually couldn't care less about this whole situation, but I found your rant rather intriguing<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>I really don't know.  I don't know what a Web 2.0 conference would cover.</p>

<p>I want to say the "Please Give Us Attention and Money Conference", but suspect people who care about Web 2.0 will think I'm angry and mean.</p>

<p>There are plenty of possibilities though; think of all of the terms that describe pieces of Web 2.0.  There's mashups, REST, web services, web APIs, open data, open APIs, microformats, JSON, Ajax, et cetera.  Then there are other ways to use "Web" and "2.0" without getting close to the service mark: Web 2.0 Weekend,  Festival, Symposium, Meetup, et cetera.</p>

<p>(It might be interesting to discuss the value of trademarks, but I thought it was worthwhile for TPC to trademark "Perl", so I've already taken one side of the argument.)</p>

<h2>Applause</h2>

Bonus points for "bloviating".
