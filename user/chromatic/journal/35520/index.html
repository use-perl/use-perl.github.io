<p>That juxtaposition of quotes is at least an order of magnitude more hilarious than the quotes are in the original context -- and they're quite amusing in context.</p>

<p>Was it Descartes who refuted Berkeley by kicking a rock?  I feel like saying the word "Netscape".  I can't think of any software successful in the way that matters to large businesses that grew out of the kind of single, perfectly-realized up-front plan that would allow you to rewrite your software from scratch.  In fact, all of the successful large systems I know of grew rather more organically from much smaller systems.</p>

<p>That doesn't mean that it's impossible to build a successful large system on the basis of a complete rewrite in a way that satisfies the business needs of a real, working, viable business.  I've just never seen any evidence that it will ever happen.</p></p>

<h2>SAP Core maybe...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2008-01-30T09:38:41</h3>
As I understand it, the core of SAP is updated on a 10 year release cycle... (that's the core business data stuff, not the gazillion products around the outside) so they might have time to have rewritten that bit.



<h2>I remember Mike</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Simon/">Simon</a> on 2008-01-30T12:34:04</h3>
He was a lovely bloke in university. Then he drank the PragProg koolaid and nothing he's said since then has made any sense at all. Still, sounds like he's happy, though.



<h2>&quot;I refute it thus!&quot;</h2>

No, it was Johnson. Descartes would never have been so practical...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>That's right.  For some reason I had Descartes in mind and totally overlooked the other English philosophers at the time.</p>
