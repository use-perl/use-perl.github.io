<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 06 February 2008.  Larry, Jerry, Will, Jesse, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>fixed a couple of bugs in Parrot</li>
<li>still have a few more to investigate (hopefully will get to Tcl and Lua)</li>
<li>spent a lot of time fixing memory leaks in IMCC</li>
<li>lots of refactoring there with Andy, lots to go</li>
<li>hopeful we can explore a switch to PIRC in the near future</li>
<li>a little bit of work left on the PMC PDD</li>
<li>promised to review the GC PDD; some concerns there</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>spent most of the week contemplating and implementing changes to the way assignment decides whether it's item or list assignment</li>
<li>the old method was quite insane in various ways</li>
<li>if you're assigning to a scalar, it's an item</li>
<li>assignment otherwise parses as list assignment</li>
<li>users and parsers should be able to keep easy track of</li>
<li>also actually edited Pugs, in Haskell, to change the determination semantics</li>
<li>it actually recompiled successfully</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I didn't know it compiled at all these days</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm still on GHC 6.6.1, and that works</li>
<li>someone proposed named placeholders</li>
<li>very handy for certain database problems</li>
<li>there are various contexts where that would be useful</li>
<li>you could do that by dereferencing the same hash...</li>
<li>because <code>$:foo</code> is still available and <code>:foo</code> looks like a named variable, I made that the named version of <code>$^a</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>how similar does that end up looking to named captures?</li>
<li>is the syntax similar?</li>
<li>in my head, named captures and named placeholders...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>named captures end up in a hash</li>
<li>never get bound to variables</li>
<li>this actually creates variables</li>
<li>also if you refer to <code>@_</code> or <code>%_</code> in one of these subs, it automatically adds that as a slurpy on the end</li>
<li>you can get control of unrecognized placeholders there</li>
<li>for a better error message, for example</li>
<li>just filling out named placeholders</li>
<li>not sure how generally useful it will be</li>
<li>it felt more orthogonal for me</li>
<li>created another twigil</li>
<li>filling out the twigil set... the more twigils we have, the more it justifies the twigil design</li>
<li>not a very strong razor, but it's a razor</li>
<li>it doesn't interfere with the other colon declarative "make this a pair" argument in signatures</li>
<li>hanging out, answering questions, tweaking F<STD.pm> where it's unclear or people notice a fix</li>
<li>putter's working on yet another F<STD.pm> analyzer</li>
<li>intended for use in backends other than Pugs</li>
<li>whether we use that for anything, he's discovering various infelicities in the standard grammar</li>
<li>TPF turned down ruoso for a grant to work on SMOP</li>
<li>discouraged him some</li>
<li>his work has helped me understand the ramifications of things like captures at a very fundamental level</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>worked with Andy a bit this week to wrap <code>snprintf()</code> and get it working on Windows</li>
<li>it's not C89</li>
<li>glad to see Larry's work on list and item assignment</li>
<li>looking forward to implementing that with Patrick</li>
<li>submitted OSCON talks for Patrick and myself</li>
<li>falling behind on development due to real life</li>
<li>hope to pick up next week sometime</li>
<li>I don't want the pace to slow too much, with Patrick unavailable this week</li>
<li>also committed a first pass at <code>perl6doc</code> for Rakudo this week</li>
<li>it's not much, but it's a place where people can start hacking on the POD grammar</li>
<li>I know people have held back from implementing things because the spec isn't finished</li>
<li>I don't see any point in waiting for implementing things here</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I agree</li>
<li>we'll have to cut a release at some point</li>
<li>#parrot is now logged</li>
<li>hopefully that'll help people get up to speed</li>
<li>going through and trying to clean up some old RT tickets</li>
<li>trying to get movement on things that are a simple matter of cleanup</li>
<li>oh, and I'm on TPF's grant committee now as a Perl 6 person</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>brian d foy raised a bug about the issue of <code>when</code> with hashes and arrays in 5.10</li>
<li>he's trying to teach the stuff and work out examples</li>
<li>I haven't looked at it, because I'm focusing on 5.8.9</li>
