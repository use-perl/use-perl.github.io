As mentioned in my previous journal, <em>brencrypt.pl</em> produces an encrypted file wrapped in a Perl program to decrypt it.  The secret key is, of course, the text of the Bill of Rights (from 'Amendment I' to 'to the people.').  Per <a href="http://pudge.net/">pudge</a>'s suggestion, the current version strips out non alphabetical and space characters, using a canonical form.  Whatever text version of the text ought to work correctly.
</p>
<p>
My loony theory, based on my status as a non-attorney, is that if I were to encrypt a copyrighted file with this program and place it on my website for download, I would not be able to distribute the text of the Bill of Rights.  The encryption effectively forms an access control; that's easy to understand.  The trick is in arguing that the *intent* of distributing the secret key is to allow other people to bypass the access control.  Together with the program, they form a tool with exactly that purpose.
</p>
<p>
Find the program itself <a href="http://wgz.org/chromatic/perl/brencrypt.tar.gz">here</a>.  To decrypt files, you'll need Crypt::CipherSaber 0.61 from the CPAN.  You'll also need the text of the Bill of Rights, but if my theory holds, I can't even tell you where to find it.  :)

<p>If it's your copyrighted work, you can distribute the Bill of Rights or tell people how to find it.  But you can't do it if it's my work.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

What if there are two pieces of work, both using the brencrypt.pl method? Then, theoretically, you would be supplying the key to his and vice versa.
