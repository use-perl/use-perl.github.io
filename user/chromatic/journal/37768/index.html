<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 29 October 2008.  Larry, Allison, Patrick, Jerry, Will, Jesse, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>slowed down on MMD bug fixing</li>
<li>cleaning up the last bugs now</li>
<li>started the IO branch</li>
<li>getting the code in much cleaner working order</li>
<li>eliminated the old pseudo-object system we had</li>
<li>changing that to use the current, existing object system</li>
<li>it looks like it will work cleanly</li>
<li>mostly can keep most of the old code</li>
<li>just change it to use objects, not just function pointers</li>
<li>the initial FileHandle PMC</li>
<li>moved the Unix, Windows, and Standard IO functions into a single set of functions loaded by Configure</li>
<li>moving the UTF-8 stuff into utility functions, instead of layering it on top in a difficult-to-maintain fashion</li>
<li>looks like we won't use roles at all for IO</li>
<li>I thought we might need them to emulate layers</li>
<li>it turns out that most layers weren't composed behavior at all</li>
<li>you need this set of functions on one OS and this set on another</li>
<li>roles don't really solve that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>delegation, not composition</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's really a lower level than that</li>
<li>operating system utility libraries</li>
<li>an interface to the OS</li>
<li>you don't want to interact with the OS directly</li>
<li>behind the interface, you compile it to do a different thing on a different OS</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Daniel Ruoso asked me on IRC about adding pointers to every SV</li>
<li>he's looking at that for SMOP</li>
<li>hope to have the release out on the weekend</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>still in the middle of doing the doctor thing on my shoulder</li>
<li>going in for an MRI this afternoon</li>
<li>making arrangements for my December trip to Australia</li>
<li>maybe or maybe not Amsterdam, depending if we can work it out</li>
<li>most of my work has been responding to various things that the SMOP folks and the syntax highlighter folks have found difficult in the STD parser</li>
<li>refactoring some of that</li>
<li>parameter parsing was not right in various ways</li>
<li>the parsing for things like POD comments was suboptimal</li>
<li>tended to attach it to the previous block where it ought to be independent</li>
<li>parsed better now</li>
<li>there were difficulties parsing assignment operators</li>
<li>tended to parse a <code>&lt;==</code> as less-than equal turned into an assignment operator</li>
<li>nipping and tucking on trying to cut down memory usage and the amount of cursor construction that has to go own</li>
<li>figuring out which cursors can be treated as mutable</li>
<li>and when we have to do copy-on-write</li>
<li>in general thinking about how I can make the parser faster</li>
<li>hopefully get rid of TRE over the next month or so</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>things are going well</li>
<li>just returned from the Google Summer of Code mentor summit</li>
<li>Jonathan Leto and I represented TPF</li>
<li>had a good time</li>
<li>I plan to write something about it, when I have the time</li>
<li>mostly devoting tuits to the Parrot Developer's Summit, coming up in the middle of November</li>
<li>expect that to be the case for the forseeable future</li>
<li>unfortunately lost the tuits I had to do namespace importation in Rakudo</li>
<li>it's very close to being done</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>worked more on fixing lexicals in Parrot</li>
<li>getting them to work the way we need them in Rakudo</li>
<li>down to 16 failing core tests</li>
<li>most of those have to do with relying on autoclosing called subroutines</li>
<li>working on a design and implementation for that</li>
<li>shouldn't take too long</li>
<li>it's going cleaner than I thought, assuming I haven't made gross errors</li>
<li>have worked on cleaning up exception handling from the PIR perspective</li>
<li>trying to get us caught up to date on that</li>
<li>published a lengthy note to the list last night describing how we should write exception handlers</li>
<li>otherwise, responding to the Rakudo ticket queue</li>
<li>either applying patches or describing why they won't work</li>
<li>getting feedback to people submitting patches</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I've been fixing a lot of bugs</li>
<li>wrote up how I fixed autoboxing primitives in MMD</li>
<li>fixed at least one segfault for Will, have more to look at</li>
<li>also fixed a couple of memory leaks</li>
<li>the default PIR programs now should never leak any memory</li>
<li>but IMCC still leaks memory in some cases</li>
<li>will continue to fix any segfault reproduced as nicely as Will has done</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the lead-in to that</li>
<li>spent most of this week trying to reduce several thousand lines of Tcl into a small PIR program so I could get past a segfault</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>one nit in the exception handler API</li>
<li>when you mark it as not having handled something, you set it to zero</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you rethrow it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's going away</li>
<li>at the moment, because exception handlers are automatically disabled, you re-enable it by setting it to zero</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that was a hack for backwards compatibility</li>
<li>it's going away</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I hate magic numbers</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I hate the fact that 0 re-enables it</li>
<li>I'm about to run the tests that turn off the auto-disable feature</li>
<li>I have everything that the pops are where they should be</li>
<li>I'll see what breaks</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>any failures should be updated pretty quickly</li>
</ul></p>
