<h1>Why would a class override isa()?</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>In a comment on my <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?UNIVERSAL::can">UNIVERSAL::can</a> module, someone asked "Why would a class override <code>isa()</code>?"</p>

<p>Easy.  Suppose your code is paranoid about the objects it receives to certain methods.  You want to make sure that you don't call invalid methods on invalid invocants.</p>

<p>That's fine.  That's good.  You don't want your code to break.</p>

<p>Of course, you're totally fine breaking <em>my</em> code.  What if I look carefully at the interface and behavior you require from such an object and write a proxy object that does absolutely everything right?  There are lots of reasons to do this -- caching, autouse trampolines, testing with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::MockObject">Test::MockObject</a>, logging, debugging.</p>

<p>If I don't override <code>isa()</code> in my class, your code vomits messily <em>even if my object does exactly what your code needs it to do</em> because all you care about is that the object you receive inherits from some base class.  Yippee.  You broke my code for no good reason.</p>

<p>That's why Perl 6 has roles and suggests that <code>does()</code> is the question you should ask of a potential invocant instead of <code>isa()</code>.  That's why you can override <code>isa()</code> in Perl 5.</p>

<p>If your code doesn't allow that (say -- if you use <code>UNIVERSAL::isa()</code> as a function, not a method), your code is broken and wrong.  Please fix it.</p>

<p>(Still don't believe me?  Go break your own code for a change:
download <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Acme::UNIVERSAL::new">Acme::UNIVERSAL::new</a> and replace all of your constructor calls with calls to <code>UNIVERSAL::new()</code>.  If that doesn't make the problem abundantly clear, I don't know what else to say.)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> removed a clause that may have given offense.  I apologize to everyone who read the previous version.</p></p>

chromatic, I was with you, thinking "right on!", until the last paragraph.  Then you blew it.  I think you owe an apology to the highly talented, dedicated and prolific programmer you referred to in the first paragraph.<br>

<p>Maybe so, but I'm tired of explaining this issue to every person who files a bug report against one of my modules when the problem is that other people break my code by writing buggy code.</p>

<p>I'm very tired of explaining why this is a problem and what the fix is and being ignored, mocked, disbelieved, and blamed for it.</p>

<p>If, after all of that, someone can't look at <code>Acme::UNIVERSAL::new</code> and see why that doesn't work and realize that the exact same problem applies to <code>UNIVERSAL::isa()</code> and <code>UNIVERSAL::new()</code>, I don't have any hope for such a programmer.</p>

<p>I don't mean to imply that any specific programmer who has disbelieved that this is a problem shouldn't be programming -- but anyone who refuses to acknowledge that this could possibly be a problem after all of this seems willfully blind to me.</p>

<p>I will strike out the sentence of great offense, though.  Thank you for the suggestion.</p>

chromatic,<br><br>It took me a while to come around to your point of view and I think it's taking others a while too.  The problem is that the buildin isa() and can() die on non-blessed objects and most people (me included) didn't think it was OK to wrap it in an eval{}.  For me, I believed the dogma that eval"" is slow and bad and transferred that to eval{}.<br><br>Unfortunately, I believe that UNIVERSAL::{can,isa}.pm are fanning the flames more than strictly necessary.  Yes, they *have* succeeded in getting people to talk about this issue, but they are sufficiently confrontational as to distract from the goal, I think.<br><br>I assert that it's time to release new versions of can.pm and isa.pm that are much less aggressive -- they silently try to work around the problem instead of issuing warnings and (in the case of isa.pm) have much more civil POD.<br><br>I think the single biggest success to date is getting perlobj.pm changed in 5.8.8.  I've been pointing people to that.<br>

<p>Without the warnings, I'm not sure people would have found and reported the bugs they did, but I do understand your point about the tone of the documentation in <code>UNIVERSAL::isa</code>.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what to say about the broken code other than that it's broken though.  Ideally I wouldn't <em>need</em> to use these modules in <code>Test::MockObject.</code></p>

While I find their _tone_ overly confrontational in the docs, having UNIVERSAL::(isa|can) silently work around is the second worst possible solution (the worst being that they die or something).<br><br>There ARE cases for using UNIVERSAL::isa and and can directly, but they are few and far between and you really need to know what you are doing.<br><br>Personally, I think I've used it in CPAN module maybe a total of 6 times where you could change a UNIVERSAL::isa call -&gt;isa and expect it to be correct. In 99% of cases you SHOULD be calling the it as a method (or using Params::Util::_INSTANCE for the DWIM approach).<br><br>And I for some am cool with locally turning off warnings for the _very_ few times someone might need it directly.<br>
