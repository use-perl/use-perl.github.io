<p><blockquote><em>Parrot releases are harder to count because of their prolific release cycle.</em></blockquote>

<p>&mdash; <a href="http://coolnamehere.com/brian/index.html">Brian Wisti</a>, <a href="http://brianwisti.blogspot.com/2009/07/in-which-brian-whinges-about-perl-5.html">In Which Brian Whinges About The Perl 5 Release Schedule</a>

<p>This is a trivial nitpick (read the rest of the article!  It's very good!), but Parrot releases are very, very easy to count.  The same goes for Rakudo releases.</p>

<p>The other day someone asked what Parrot might look like in a hundred years.  I laughed and thought, "What would its version number be?"  Then I realized that <em>I can predict its version number in 100 years</em>.  Parrot 101.6 will be out, with Parrot 101.7 on the way.</p>

<p>For all of the lofty talk about "stability" and "maturity" and "predictability" which results in Perl 5 <em>not</em> getting released, the fact that I can predict the release date and version number of a piece of software one hundred years in the future says something about the stability, maturity, predictability, and reliability of a very different kind of development process.</p>

<p>(Oh, and Alias -- I can crash several so-called stable releases of Perl 5 with a one-liner the same way you crashed Parrot in December 2008 with a short program.  If you want to make the argument that the 30 stable monthly releases of Parrot in a row don't actually exist because they had bugs, the two so-called stable releases of Perl 5 from the same time period don't exist either.  Ontological debates are easy to lose.)</p></p>

<h2>I didn't crash parrot</h2>

<p>I just let the program run for a minute and a half until it leaked all memory on the host and was killed off by the kernel...</p><p>I look forward to a packaged distribution so that I can replicate the original test and confirm that the problem has been removed.</p>

<blockquote><div><p> <em>I just let the program run for a minute and a half until it leaked all memory on the host and was killed off by the kernel...</em></p></div> </blockquote><p>My Perl 5 program does the same.  I confirmed it now with bleadperl; Perl 5.10.1 will very likely have the same problem.</p>

<h2>Okay, so counting isn't all that hard</h2>

I was on a roll by that point, though.
