<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 12 September 2007.  Larry, Allison,
Patrick, Jesse, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>discussing various S05 changes with Larry</li>
<li>implemented some of them to keep Parrot up to date</li>
<li>I expect the new compiler tools to use updated S05 versions</li>
<li>better to get the updates in before other people start using them</li>
<li>the changes look really good</li>
<li>they simplify things a lot</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>with carping in the backchannels</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>all of my carping is in public on IRC</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>unlogged IRC</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>well yeah</li>
<li>continuing to work on the revisions to namespace support in PCT</li>
<li>I have a design laid out in my head</li>
<li>hope to get it implemented this afternoon</li>
<li>otherwise just watching the commit list</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>how is the hacking of other people going?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Colin has a commit bit and has already done a couple of commits</li>
<li>there are other people doing documentation and checking out other features</li>
<li>seems to be going well</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>mostly re-rationalizing the various tradeoffs in S05</li>
<li>still ramifications of the decision to reserve all punctuation</li>
<li>that changes the desirability of using puncutation in various ways</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it removes one of the constraints</li>
<li>frees us to do things in nicer ways</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we have to decide whether they're actually nicer or just look nicer</li>
<li>may or may not end up with a shorter way of representing the whitespace rule</li>
<li>don't have to put <code>.ws</code> all over the place</li>
<li>currently under discussion</li>
<li>there are <em>n</em> different ways to do it</li>
<li>on PerlMonks, someone pointed out that there's no good way of having a temporary binding that doesn't end up in the final match</li>
<li>you could use it for repetitions</li>
<li>perhaps a rule that begins with an underscore might end up not getting matchified</li>
<li>if the whitespace rule ended up being underscore, it might not capture</li>
<li>other than that, work's been fairly hairy</li>
<li>still thinking belatedly about the questions for an interview</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>created a branch for new OO in Parrot</li>
<li>lion-taming to try to get it to compile</li>
<li>ran into one spot, getting PGE to compile</li>
<li>had to fix the <code>subclass</code> opcode</li>
<li>currently looking at a problem in <code>GetOpt::Object</code></li>
<li>can't find a method in that oddly-defined class</li>
<li>just need to standardize its use of OO</li>
<li>also spent some time creating a Parrot timeline</li>
<li>want to make it public after we meet a few deadlines</li>
<li>it's given me more concrete ideas of what I work on every weeek</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we should have five or six done by the end of October</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>basically one deadline every two weeks</li>
<li>lots of them are parallelizable</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>found some bugs</li>
<li>fixed some bugs</li>
<li>having lots of trouble with platform-specific things</li>
<li>mostly the unavailability of certain platforms I don't have access to</li>
<li>if we had a smoke farm or something that we could get results from various platforms, we could get more results</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>sounds like a reasonably good cage-cleaner or newbie task</li>
<li>someone popped up with a relatively unused IA-64 machine and offered to help with bleadperl</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>working with Richard Dice to get the microgrants paid</li>
<li>Adriano Ferreira has put in a proposal for a new grant</li>
<li>we're talking about that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>feels like we ought to use lexicals for backrefs without captures</li>
<li>whenever I've read S05, that seemed to be the natural way to capture something into a variable that doesn't end up into a match object</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's one way to work it</li>
<li>seems like the default is backwards though</li>
<li>usually the reason you bind something is because you already have the name somewhere, and you want to capture it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>not sure I agree with that</li>
<li>naming a thing gives you an abstraction, but doesn't necessarily imply that you want to use that abstraction elsewhere</li>
<li>that's why we have lexicals and not just dynamic scope everywhere</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>almost wish I had a twigil that was shorter than greater-than/less-than</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>maybe add it to everything else you're juggling at the moment</li>
<li>seems straightforward and natural to me though</li>
</ul>
