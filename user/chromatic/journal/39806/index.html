<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 14 October 2009.  Larry, Allison, Patrick, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>have a question</li>
<li>I'm not happy with the <code>:lang</code> attribute in regexes</li>
<li>I'll explore in my own direction</li>
<li>Larry can complain about that when he gets back</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I wouldn't expect anything less</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>worked more on nqp_rx</li>
<li>PAST- and POST-based</li>
<li>going exceedingly well</li>
<li>I have almost every feature that PGE provides</li>
<li>what's left is minor</li>
<li>either we don't need them and/or they're easy to add when necessary</li>
<li>the new engine passes about 3/4 of PGE's test suite</li>
<li>the rest is minor</li>
<li>specifying characters by number or Unicode name, for example, <code>\x</code> and <code>\c</code></li>
<li>today's task is to make the new engine self-hosting</li>
<li>the regex parser should be able to parse itself</li>
<li>that shouldn't be hard to do at all</li>
<li>that'll also speed things up quite a bit</li>
<li>it's currently two or three times slower than PGE when running the tests</li>
<li>that's because the regex parser is slower</li>
<li>the code that does the matches is much faster</li>
<li>that's a nice tradeoff; we generally parse regexes once and run them a lot</li>
<li>adding features to the new engine has been incredibly easy</li>
<li>many of them tend to be five or six lines at most</li>
<li>it's a bunch of short code</li>
<li>I'll continue working on that for the next week</li>
<li>I expect to write the new version of NQP in the next couple of days</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>working on the pcc_reapply branch of Parrot</li>
<li>lots of fixes there</li>
<li>went down from 82 failing tests on the corevm target to 18 failing tests on the full Parrot test suite</li>
<li>PGE now compiles and runs just fine on the branch</li>
<li>still working on the last few failures</li>
<li>started doing language testing as well</li>
<li>Cardinal and another language pass on the branch with no problems</li>
<li>have CallSignature optimizations ready to merge in</li>
<li>waiting for one feature from chromatic on that</li>
<li>also, quantum computation is a lot of fun</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>refactored CallSignature PMC to optimize it</li>
<li>one last change to make</li>
<li>where did the 12,000 passing Rakudo tests come from?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>mostly trig, transcendental, and math functions</li>
<li>they're automatically generated for <code>Int</code>, <code>Num</code>, and <code>Complex</code></li>
<li>it's a nice jump on the graph</li>
<li>we need to put out a nice message about what happened</li>
<li>I'll talk more about the percentage of the suite passing than the number of passing tests</li>
<li>the argument "You can add thousands of passing tests and not make progress" makes some sense</li>
<li>that's why I'll talk about percentage of the suite from now on</li>
<li>I'll report for Jonathan too</li>
<li>he's redoing parameter binding in a branch</li>
<li>currently, that's fairly slow in Rakudo</li>
<li>after we call a subroutine, we perform the type checks and throw exceptions if necessary</li>
<li>we do binding from incoming parameters to lexicals there too</li>
<li>that all required a lot of method calls</li>
<li>every subroutine call in Rakudo caused at least four or five Parrot method calls</li>
<li>he's redone parameter binding</li>
<li>primarily in C</li>
<li>he's created a set of dynops to make it much quicker</li>
<li>Rakudo's Subroutine PMC type can do the type checking before invocation now</li>
<li>he's seeing a significant performance improvement there</li>
<li>the pcc_reapply branch in Parrot will also simplify what he's doing there</li>
<li>he expects to merge before the release next week</li>
<li>it's been outstanding work</li>
<li>do we have an ETA for the branch landing?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>very shortly after 1.7</li>
<li>within minutes or hours</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that fits our planning well</li>
<li>Parrot releases 1.7 next Tuesday</li>
<li>Jonathan will probably merge his branch in then</li>
<li>his branch will use Parrot's existing calling conventions</li>
<li>if someone tries to build Rakudo today or Jonathan's branch against pcc_reapply, Rakudo will likely fail</li>
<li>we're fine with that</li>
<li>don't consider it a blocker for Parrot</li>
<li>we'll adapt to whatever you do</li>
<li>I expect that Rakudo's trunk will run against the 1.7 release until 1.8</li>
<li>we have two major projects</li>
<li>one is converting our argument handling to Parrot's new PCC</li>
<li>the other is completely replacing Rakudo's grammar to use the new NQP</li>
<li>almost all of our work will take place in branches, not trunk</li>
<li>we'll merge back to trunk when we have everything working</li>
