<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 21 October 2009.  Larry, Allison, Patrick, Will, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>fixing a few last bugs in the pcc_reapply branch</li>
<li>extremely pleased to see the work over the weekend</li>
<li>I was away from my computer for a day, but when I came back there was only one failing test</li>
<li>kudos all around</li>
<li>merged it to trunk today</li>
<li>that went smoothly</li>
<li>there was one hitch; I merged it in as a patch</li>
<li>missed a file that was added in trunk but didn't <code>svn add</code> it before the commit</li>
<li>otherwise no merge problems</li>
<li>glad we'd recently rebranched</li>
<li>that made things go smoother</li>
<li>plan to work on Pynie this week</li>
<li>open to suggestions as to what to work on next</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>working on nqp-rx this past week</li>
<li>it's going well</li>
<li>the regex engine does everything PGE did before, except for character classes and backtracking in subrules</li>
<li>I know how to implement that, but I haven't needed it yet</li>
<li>it's self-hosted, as far as grammar parsing goes</li>
<li>originally built it using PGE</li>
<li>builds itself since last Friday</li>
<li>no longer depends on PGE at all</li>
<li>worked on a self-hosted version of NQP over the weekend</li>
<li>putting together some core pieces</li>
<li>did quoting rules</li>
<li>capable enough to handle Perl 6 quoting rules</li>
<li>you can also limit it to simpler quotes</li>
<li>most people will do that</li>
<li>you can share the quoting parser using common backslash sequences quickly</li>
<li>very customizable</li>
<li>if you're creating your own language with new or different backslash sequences, you can write a new regex and add it trivially</li>
<li>lots of other small code generation</li>
<li>put together a new operator precedence parser</li>
<li>it's not intimately tied to the regex engine, like PGE's was</li>
<li>reusable</li>
<li>you can have multiple op precedence parsers within the same language</li>
<li>no trouble dealing with that</li>
<li>looks similar to the Perl 6 version</li>
<li>cleaned it up a bit over STD, especially over quotes</li>
<li>no roles and coercions in this version</li>
<li>just hashes</li>
<li>should be easier to explain to others</li>
<li>I hope Larry will consider adopting my version</li>
<li>I don't know if he's considering wider ideas that I haven't considered or encountered yet</li>
<li>I like what I've come up with so far</li>
<li>the new version of NQP is a reimplementation using the new parser</li>
<li>the new version will bootstrap</li>
<li>also exercises the new operator precedence parser and protoregexes</li>
<li>that'll help us switch Rakudo over to the new system sooner</li>
<li>easier to debug there than from Rakudo</li>
<li>hope to have a working version of NQP by Friday</li>
<li>hopefully even self-hosting by then</li>
<li>nqp-rx will work based on core Parrot</li>
<li>it requires no external libraries besides PAST</li>
<li>we could move that out of Parrot or reimplement it, but that's low on my priority list</li>
<li>posted to use.perl.org that outlines the Rakudo plans for the next month</li>
<li>we'll have several weeks of serious upheaval, tearing the existing grammar out of place and replacing it</li>
<li>very pleased with now nqp-rx is coming together</li>
<li>I hope it'll go quickly</li>
<li>Jonathan and I will work on it at the same time</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>working on Partcl</li>
<li>minor cleanup, trying to make sure it still works with blead Parrot</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I don't like UTF-16</li>
<li>Perl 5 should be able to read it big-endian and little-endian</li>
<li>Larry wrote the original code</li>
<li>I've fought several bugs in it</li>
<li>you get the benefit of larger sizes and variable length</li>
<li>but you have to deal with partial reads</li>
<li>I don't know if Rakudo will have to deal with it, but blah!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>fixing bugs</li>
<li>profiling</li>
<li>trying to optimize</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Jonathan and I and other Rakudo hackers may need to lean on you for assistance</li>
<li>mostly Larry</li>
<li>lots of Parrot hackers who understand PCC and can fix bugs</li>
<li>we'll probably need resolution on spec issues regarding <code>Capture</code>s and <code>Parcel</code>s and the like</li>
<li>they're at the heart of what we're doing</li>
<li>we may get to blockers very quickly</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>is Rakudo taking over from SMOP in pushing the spec?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we're pushing from different directions</li>
<li>I'm still interested in moving Partcl to the compiler toolkit</li>
<li>think it should move to the new one, not the old one</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's a good idea</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>once it's a little further, I'll schedule some time with you</li>
<li>discuss what's happening and how to migrate</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I don't mind being the guinea pig</li>
<li>it'll give some speed wins</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it'll enable more people to hack on it</li>
<li>if things work out well, a big part of your system will be written in NQP</li>
<li>switching it over to the old toolkit doesn't make sense now</li>
<li>I want to make sure the new system will handle Partcl</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>all delegation objects, including arrays and hashes, get handled the same</li>
<li>placeholders may never be used in a hash composer</li>
<li>that makes <code>map</code> almost always work right</li>
<li>placeholders <code>@_</code> and <code>%_</code> were enabled only if other placeholders were used, but they now are usable standalone</li>
<li>make the signatures of p5 notation fall out more naturally</li>
<li>clarified that <code>$_</code> behaves like a placeholder only if there are no other placeholders</li>
<li>clarified how <code>if</code> statements behave with those rules</li>
<li>clarified <em>en passant</em> type captures</li>
<li>clarified when <code>...</code> should be a stub</li>
<li>documented that <code>sub</code>s now default to <code>my</code> scope</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that'll be a fun change</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I warned you several months ago</li>
<li>revised the notation of the <code>:D</code> type subset for the defined and undefined modifiers and pragmas for changing the defaults</li>
<li>lots of debugging</li>
<li>STD treated constraints as declarative</li>
<li>fixed them to catch undeclared variables</li>
<li>placeholder twigils now require an alphabetic character all the time</li>
<li>fixed <code>viv</code> to fix Perl 6 roundtripping</li>
<li>unbitrotted the Perl 5 emitter</li>
<li>still plan to replace <code>gimme5</code> someday</li>
<li>infix operators now allowed to see the opp's precedence limiter as a contextual variable</li>
<li>added more information to the match tree for declarations</li>
<li>now have entries pointing into the pad and the declarand itself</li>
<li>forbade self-declared parameters in defaults, as their scopes were unclear</li>
<li>allow contextual sub declarations with <code>sub &amp;*foo</code></li>
<li>class declarations now allow <code>...</code>, treated reasonably</li>
<li>fixed quasi-unquote parsing</li>
<li>split the Perl 5 grammar more</li>
<li>dups inside a multisig now treat the multis independently</li>
<li>switched to YAML::XS to work around Syck's roundtrip problems</li>
<li>cached the setting files in case I parsed multiple parses</li>
<li>didn't treat them as immutable</li>
<li>caused magical action at a distance</li>
<li>did a bunch of work on <code>viv</code></li>
