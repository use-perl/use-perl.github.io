Yesterday was productive, as <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Text-WikiFormat-0.2">Text::WikiFormat</a> received documentation attention.  This is always the last step of my release cycle.  Strangely enough, though I enjoy commenting on code (think <strong>commentary</strong>), I dislike writing documentation, example usage, and all of the things that make developers happy.  I even prefer writing tests.
</p><p>
It's a good sanity check, though.  Things that are difficult to explain clearly usually need polish.  Things I'd rather not explain usually need to be fixed.  I tend to add a couple of convenient features and fix annoying buglets during the documentation phase.
</p>
<p>
I've been doing more work on my Perl bytecode->XML->refactoring/linting/improving->XML->Perl code.  Since Schwern asked so nicely ("I don't understand what you claimed to be doing, but are you going to make it available?"), you can download it <a href="http://wgz.org/chromatic/perl/B-ToXML.tar.gz">here</a>.  It works like any other backend module.  Try <tt>perl -MO=ToXML proggie.pl</tt> to print an XML  file representing (what I can decipher to be) the important parts of the compiled bytecode.  If you want to output to a file, use <tt>perl -MO=ToXML,-ofilename proggie.pl</tt> instead.  If you just want to dump a function or functions and print to a file, it's <tt>perl -MO=ToXML,-ofilename,func1,func2 proggie.pl</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Bypassing the idea of transformations at this point, I'm left with the task of turning XML back into Perl.  There are two possibilities.  I could use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&query=B%3A%3AGenerate">B::Generate</a> to create an optree, then run it through B::Deparse.  The other option is to generate just enough data to send to B::Deparse directly.  I much prefer the latter, though I haven't tried the former.
</p>
<p>
The odds either Simon Cozens or Rafael Garcia-Suarez will take pity on me and reveal the secret information I'm not saving in B::ToXML or the magic of sending data to B::Deparse are minimal.
</p>
<p>
Since I should be writing two articles aimed at novices, packing up everything I own for a move, or any of several other important things, it's a great distraction.

<h2>XML2perl?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rafael/">rafael</a> on 2002-02-20T21:33:07</h3>
It's very interesting: yet another format to dump bytecode, but a standard one, this time. (Is there a DTD for the output of B::ToXML ?)<p>BTW you can perform some optimizations on the optree, but once turned back into perl code, you've no guarantee that your optimizations will remain. Moreover, a modified optree will not necessarily be turnable into perl code: B::Deparse makes some assumptions on the format of the optree it is given. That's why sometimes bugs are introduced in B::Deparse by modifications in the perl core -- e.g. the recent rcatline optimization, not visible from the Perl language, as it affects only the optree. Be careful then.</p><p>Have you heard about Simon's optimizer.pm? You may find it interesting. (It's still alpha, but I think Simon is writing a paper about it.)</p><p>And now, a little bit of advertisement: my personal favorite about backend modules that dump the optree is B::Concise. It's really useful to debug internals. Now that I've discovered it, I don't use B::Terse anymore. So give it a try.</p>

<p>
There's no DTD yet -- I keep having to change things as I learn more.  It's on the verge of working, though.  I have looked at Simon's pluggable optimizer, but haven't figured out what to do with it.  His B::Generate article in last year's TPC proceedings has really come in handy.

This is really interesting. I am doing something similar in the introspector.sf.net project.
Maybe I can use your XML output as well?
please tell me where I can find this code for B::toXML?<br/><br/>Thanks,
mike
