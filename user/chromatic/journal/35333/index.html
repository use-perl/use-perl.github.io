<p><p>With a production Perl 5.8.8, production Python 2.5.1, and unoptimized Parrot built for debugging from r24673, running each benchmark three times in a row to populate disk caches and the like and reporting the best numbers:</p>

<code>$ time perl examples/benchmarks/fib.pl<br />
fib(28) = 317811<br />
<br />
real    0m0.602s<br />
user    0m0.596s<br />
sys     0m0.004s<br />
<br />
$ time python examples/benchmarks/fib.py<br />
fib(28) = 317811<br />
<br />
real    0m0.367s<br />
user    0m0.364s<br />
sys     0m0.004s<br />
<br />
$ time parrot examples/benchmarks/fib.pir<br />
fib(28) = 317811 1.949330s<br />
<br />
real    0m1.965s<br />
user    0m1.960s<br />
sys     0m0.004s<br /></code>

<p>That's not <em>great</em> for Parrot, but it's a debugging build without optimizations.  However, there are some optimizations built in and enabled with special command-line flags:</p>

<code>$ time parrot -Cj -O3 examples/benchmarks/fib.pir<br />
fib(28) = 317811 0.007451s<br />
<br />
real    0m0.023s<br />
user    0m0.016s<br />
sys     0m0.004s<br /></code>

<p>That's better.  Again, this is with a debugging build.  With an optimized, non-debugging build (that is, no debugging symbols, no assertions, and GCC's <code>-O2</code):</p>

<code>$ time parrot examples/benchmarks/fib.pir<br />
fib(28) = 317811 1.156776s<br />
<br />
real    0m1.170s<br />
user    0m1.164s<br />
sys     0m0.000s<br /></code>

<p>That's better.  Now the punchline:</p>

$ time parrot -Cj -O3 examples/benchmarks/fib.pir<br />
fib(28) = 317811 0.007305s<br />
<br />
real    0m0.020s<br />
user    0m0.012s<br />
sys     0m0.004s<br /></code>

<p>Of course, it's important not to get too cocky.  There are languages specifically optimized for generating the Fibonacci sequence:</p>

<code>$ time ./haskell_fib<br />
"fib(28) = 317811"<br />
<br />
real    0m0.003s<br />
user    0m0.000s<br />
sys     0m0.004s<br /></code>

<p>Still, for a development version of Parrot that's not bad.</p></p>

<h2>Sort of a lower bound</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mdiep/">mdiep</a> on 2008-01-08T22:01:41</h3>
I think it's important to note that the PIR example represents something of a lower bound for languages targeting Parrot.<br><br>The PIR code is designed to be fast and is most likely simpler than the generated code will be from any HLL compiler (and it doesn't need to load any whole language runtimes). So while I hope that Perl-6-on-Parrot will generate such fast code, in all likelihood I think it'll be a fair bit slower than that.<br><br>It's a good thing that the PIR is that fast, but I don't think it's much of a metric. If the PIR were slower than Perl/Python, we'd know that Perl 6/etc was going to be slower, but the fact that it's faster doesn't mean that Perl 6/etc will be faster &#8211; it just means that it could conceivably be faster.

<p>That's a fair point, but it's also important to note that it's possible to write efficient and cross-platform PIR by hand to use from any HLL in case you need additional speed.  Compare that to dropping down to C (and then trying to distribute that C across multiple platforms).</p>

<p>Even if Perl 6 on Parrot is an order of magnitude slower than PIR on Parrot, it's still faster than Perl 5 on C.</p>

<h2>Good enough for me</h2>

Ok, I won't complain anymore<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but wait, what about der perl6 binary?

<p>Please try something <b>real<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</b> like <code>fib 38</code>.</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>$ time<nobr> <wbr></nobr>./parrot -Cj -O3 examples/benchmarks/fib.pir 38<br>fib(38) = 39088169 0.671501s</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>(on my ancient 2GHz Athlon). Wirh perl 5.8.8  it's consuming some time:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>$ time perl examples/benchmarks/fib.pl 38<br>fib(38) = 39088169<br> <br>real&nbsp; &nbsp; 2m3.206s</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>which is exactly what I've always said: compiler to interpreter <b>ops</b> performance is about 200:1 (which doesn't say anything about any <b>program</b> performance, e.g. perl regexes are ~equally fast compared to the <code>pcre</code> library)</p><p><blockquote> <div><tt>$ echo '(2*60+3)/0.67'|bc<br>183</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>And a final note: these numbers don't say anything about perl6 or OO code or whatever - these are peak performance possibilities of the parrot engine with JITted native types.</p>
