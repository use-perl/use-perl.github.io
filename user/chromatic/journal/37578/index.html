<p>&mdash; <a href="http://perladmin.oreally.co.uk/">admin</a>, <a href="http://perladmin.oreally.co.uk/blog/2008/09/why-im-writing-this-blog/">Why I'm Writing This Blog</a></p>

<p>Maybe if I keep saying "We release a new stable version of <a href="http://www.parrot.org/">Parrot</a> on the third Tuesday of every month, and we've done so twenty times now, and every release includes a new stable version of <a href="http://www.rakudo.org/">Rakudo</a>, an implementation of Perl 6 on Parrot," people will start getting the message.  Perl 6 and Parrot exist and they get better every day.  We do all of our development in public.  You can see our progress every day.</p>

<p>Goodness gracious, you can even look at <a href="http://www.rakudo.de/">Rakudo spectest graphs</a>, updated daily, to see the <em>velocity</em> of progress on Rakudo.  I particularly like the sharp uptick in the past week, where we added some 18% more passing tests.  The second graph shows this more dramatically.</p>

<p>What the graph <em>doesn't</em> show is that the Google Summer of Code funding ended for <a href="http://auzon.blogspot.com/">Adrian Kreher</a>, that Patrick Michaud has completed the Mozilla Foundation grant, and that Jonathan Worthington (funded for one or two days a week -- I believe it's back to one -- to work on Rakudo) has been on vacation.</p>

<p>Using "vaporware" to describe a project that consistently hits monthly stable releases and <em>increases</em> velocity despite a lack of funding and the vacation of project leaders stretches the definition past the point of belief.</p>

<p>Then again, how many people who "comment" on Perl 6 and Parrot actually bother to look up and quote relevant statistics?  (That in itself suggests something about their level of information.)</p></p>

<p>
You can say you're working on perl6 all you want, and put out stable parrot releases, but they're not stable releases of "perl 6" until you can go to perl.com and when you click "download" it gives you something other than 5.10.
</p><p>
*I* know perl6 is progressing, and *you* know perl6 is progressing, and other folks around here know it's progressing, and perhaps it's even usable day-to-day right now, but it's not perceived as "there, we're ready to have regular users use this, and we declare it perl 6.0" until it's really released.  Release-early-release-often is good for development, but it's not the same as "we've put out a non-development release and we stand by it."
</p><p>
Until that 6.0 comes out, with a big announcement, no one will believe it's anything more than <a href="http://www.enlightenment.org/" title="enlightenment.org">Enlightenment</a enlightenment.org> eternal snapshot mode.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

Right, I think everyone believes it exists, but IMHO, their "little but vapour-ware" comment meant: not yet ready for anyone but developers who are knee-deep in perl to look at.  The casual perl-using crowd who have grown perl5 to the huge user-base it enjoys use it to get things done, not to play with the new hot perl6 stuff.
</p><p>
I think we're in violent agreement, for the most part.  I just don't think the vapour-ware comment meant "nonexistant", rather I think it meant "not yet blessed by the perl6 community as ready for a wider audience beyond hardcore perl geeks."  You're just not going to stop getting such comments until something that indicates the project is winding down the "language design" phase and working into the "stabilizing and getting user feedback" phase by releasing an alpha/beta.

<p>It looks like it may be moving forward now, unilke 2001 to around 2005 or so.  However, Perl 5 has also adopted Perl 6's useful bits -- "say," "//," named subpatterns, OO stuff (via Moose) -- and via Devel::Declare, may soon get named parameters as well.  My wild guess is that Perl 6 will be officially done in 3-5 years.  When it's done, Perl 6 will have to compete with a mature Perl 5 that has been consistently cloning many of its best features.  Unless Perl 6 has some kind of killer app, that's a very, very hard sell.</p>

<p>I agree that Perl 5 does move slowly, for the reasons you mention among others, but 5.10 was a big step forward from 5.8, so Perl 5 certainly hasn't ground to a halt.  Perl 6 (whichever version) also moves slowly (or at least unevenly), and has much more ground to cover than Perl 5, which has been a mature language for many years.  It will be interesting to see whether or not Perl 6 becomes mature before Perl 5 adopts most of its interesting features.</p>

I have no idea where you're getting this.  Are you saying (with a straight face) that none of the new features in 5.10 (wait another few months and re-read this if you insist) were borrowed from 6?  Or that no future release of Perl 5 can possibly borrow more features of Perl 6?  Or are you just trying to browbeat me into dropping the subject?  I have nothing against Perl 6, but it has to prove itself just like any other language (Python, Ruby, Lua, Haskell,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...) as a replacement for Perl 5 as my main scripting language.</p>

<p>I'm saying that it's impossible to shoehorn new and changed features into Perl 5 without modifying the internals substantially.  Given the strictness of backwards compatibility, that's impossible... at least without deprecating the changes through one stable major release cycle.</p><p>Even a feature as simple as the one I backported (<code>!!!</code>) potentially broke old code.  I disbelieve that adding anything more complex would be free in terms of backwards compatibility, especially if it touches the parser.</p>

<p>I'm saying that somehow these substantial internals changes keep happening fast enough to adopt Perl 6 features at a decent rate.  It's an empirical question whether or not this continues.  Also, "potentially broke" is not the same as "broke" -- has anyone reported your feature having broken actual code?</p>

Where I get my perl 6 information?  I skim p5p sometimes (e.g. I read some of the posts on the regex work), but since I'm not a core developer, there's no sense in reading it religiously.  However, I have read perl5100delta, maybe a few blog posts or articles, and some journals here, so I know about the new features.  Heck, anyone visiting the front page of use.perl will see that poll that's been up forever.  If you think I'm ignorant in particular ways, you'll have to be more specific.<blockquote><div><p>Admittedly it's unlikely that someone would use the affected construct in anything other than golf or obfuscation</p></div></blockquote><p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know about the decent rate. Most of the adopted features were either utterly trivial (<code>say</code>) or only half-adopted as a significantly semantically poorer version (<code>~~</code>). But there is <em>a lot</em> more in Perl&#160;6 than those. And the rate of adoption is only going to slow down as easily adopted Perl&#160;6 features start running out and the remnants get more and more intertwined with the richer, less ambiguous semantics of Perl&#160;6.</p><p>As for the new regex constructs in 5.10, there isn&#8217;t a single person who would call their syntax anything but frighteningly ugly.</p>

<p>Define "significantly semantically poorer."  AFAICT Perl 5's smart match is a good adaptation of Perl 6's.  Perl 6 has a richer type system, so its smart match has to do more things, which I would call "semantically more appropriate."</p><p>Of what does your "a lot more" consist?  (God, proper English grammar is awkward...)  And before you say "pervasive OO," remember that I'm not an OO dogmatist, so I don't care about that.</p><p>Like I said before, this is an empirical question.  So far, the evidence is that Perl 5 can keep up with Perl 6 well enough.  Perl 6 is cool in theory -- enough so that I sunk many hours into it in 2001-2002 -- but it has much 'splaining to do in 2008.</p>

What if I just want to create apps without having to dive into the guts of my favourite language's next version? Not every developer loves poking around at such a low level and I'd like to leave this to the ones who know and love this stuff. I don't think many PHP/Python/Ruby (and Perl) programmers developing popular high-volume web sites participate in developing the next version of their language, do you? What do you think how many construction workers build their own jack hammer?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-) I didn't mean to diss anyone and have high respect for every perl6 developer. But just ignoring (or bashing against) all this "perl5 is dying and perl6 is vapourware" stuff is dangerous IMHO because it shows what perl is missing the most: a face and a positive image. Not solely some super awesome stuff going on deep in the guts that sends chills down every comp-sci's spine.

What souldchild said. I have been trying to follow the development of Perl 6 and, not having a comp-sci background (I'm an engineer), most of it was gobbly gook to me.

For instance I have not idea what any of this means:<blockquote><div><p> <i>Better internals? Pervasive OO? Mutable lexical grammars? Working exceptions? NCI? Macros? JIT? Bytecode? Grammars? Serializable continuations? Multidispatch? STM? Hyperoperators? Pervasive laziness? Immutable sigils? True reference context? Aliasing and binding? Few globals? A robust parser?</i></p></div> </blockquote><p>

I just wish I could understand how all that gobbly gook benefits my work or why I should be excited about it.</p>

<p>But of course the real question is: if you are not willing to spend the few hours to research what these things are, and how they would benefit your work, why --pray-tell-us-- should anyone be even slightly interested in what you have to say on the matter of Perl6 development?</p><p>[[Side question: do you really not know what "Better internals" means?

Wake up to yourselves..." folk who want the shiny new package and want it *now*.

<p>Once in a while a disinterested, uninformed (not meant pejoratively) observer makes a brilliant observation which transforms a field of study.  For every one of those, you have to put up with most of a million Time Cubes.

<p>Fine, let me spell it out for you.</p><p>Perl 5's internals are a mess of poorly documented and often intrinsically contradictory features implemented as mazes of macros calling macros calling macros and pseudo-OO C code implemented as semi-isomorphic structs.  There's little distinction between an internal and an external API, and it's almost completely unknowable if changing any part of the API will break the guarantees of backwards source compatibility that p5p tries to maintain even between stable major releases.  There is almost no encapsulation.</p><p>Adding new features is extremely difficult.  Cleaning up the existing code within the system as it exists now is nearly impossible.  Deprecating awful features takes years.  Refactoring the API may take decades, if it ever happens.  Adding new features -- especially if they include syntax -- means shoehorning yet more code into crevices between the lexer and the parser, and Larry help you if you need to <em>modify</em> existing code there.</p><p>I don't know how much more clearly I can put this.  Perl 5's internals are a mess.  Almost anything else is better, including most of Parrot.  I've hacked on both of them.  I've explained how to hack on both of them to other people.  People who have hacked on Perl 5 have done things very differently in Parrot due to the experience.</p><p>Is that concrete enough for you?</p>

<p>As an example of that, I proposed that &#8220;<code>length undef</code>&#8221; should silently return undef rather than returning 0 after warning about undef. Rafa&#235;l took a first short at implementing this, but it broke thousands of tests, which puzzled him. Nicholas spotted the problem quickly, but it took him an extended tracing session to figure out where all he needed to stick flags in order to make disparate parts of the guts work together so that this would work as specified. When it takes Nicholas and half a day for such a trivial feature to be implemented, you know the code base is convoluted&#8230;</p>

<p>In Perl 6, if <code>length</code> were written in Perl 6, we'd add another multi variant for the undef case.  It's two SLOC.  If <code>length</code> were written in PIR, it's four or five SLOC.  Either way, it's trivial code.</p>

<p>Yes -- sorry to have raised the temperature of this discussion.</p><p>I agree that they're painfully complex.  I have the git clone of the blead repository sitting on my disk as we type.  But I think one of the things Perl 5 teaches is the value of staring complexity in the face and beating it to death with the available blunt instruments.  Starting over always feels great -- I love doing so with my own code -- but there are reasons that perl5, like many other mature pieces of software, is so ugly.  And it will take perl6 time to rediscover these reasons.</p><p>So I agree that perl6 is cleaner, because younger software is always cleaner than older software.  But I reserve judgement about whether it's better enough to make up for perl5's maturity.  I hope perl6 will still be cleaner than perl5 when it is as fast, portable, and stable, but I'll wait and see.</p>

I believe it will be, but that doesn't happen overnight, and it doesn't happen because I hope or wish it to be true.  Right now Rakudo doesn't run Perl 5 modules, and that's a big drawback.  Perl 6 without some sort of standardish library won't be nearly as useful as Perl 5 even if Perl 6 is multiple orders of magnitude better as a language.  There are several axes along which to measure goodness.</p>

<p>The two main reasons for ugliness I'm talking about are weird platform issues and non-obvious cases where some language behavior makes more sense.  It's almost impossible to anticipate these things, so you just have to spend years tripping on and fixing them.</p><p>I think Perl 6 has an advantage in uncovering these things because of its heritage, but it's far from automatic.</p>
