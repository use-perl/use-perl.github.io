<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 20 September 2006.  Larry, Patrick,
and Nicholas attended.  These are the minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Patrick</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Weather is getting back to normal now.</li>
<li>Had been the worst drought since the '50s.</li>
<li>Temperatures were in the low 100s, now down to the 80s</li>
<li>Now raining once a week</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>When I was in LA in July it was hitting the 100s and the power grid
	  didn't like it. What happens in Texas?</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Temperatures in the 100s are expected; the grid is built to cope.</li>
<li>Texas doesn't have energy problems. We get California to pay for our
	  infrastructure</li>

</ul>

<p>Larry laughed.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Can I ask a question of your design sense?</li>
<li>I've used the compile time traits as decorators on things.</li>
<li>Is this bad, or can I do it more liberally</li>
<li>This is for operators such as infix &&</li>
<li>Lot of languages have that, would be good if the PAST node structure
	  could express that. If a language says I have infix && as one of my
	  tokens - it is OK to translate that to a PAST node that also says
	  "this short circuits"?</li>
<li>this would saves having to write a transformation rule that handles
	  this before it hits an AST</li>
<li>Already we can say left, right, chain associative - can we also put
	  traits that say "oh it short circuits"?</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Larry</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Is this there in lieu of something else that ought to be there, such
	  as thunks?</li>
<li>Thunks are a level of laziness - "this is a thing that I'll tell you
	  when you can evaluate it."</li>
<li>Tend to discourage these in Perl 6 except for &&</li>
<li>The danger is that people put declarations in the thunk block, and
	  expect that it gets executed, when often it does not.</li>
<li>In Perl 5 terms, my $x if 0;</li>
<li>In Perl 6 tend to encourage people to use explicit curlies for that
	  sort of thing. But for general AST you would want to support those sort of constructs.</li>
<li>Probably a property of the particular arguments not the property
	  itself</li>
<li>It's really call by name</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Moving away from short circuiting other compiler specific things that
	  we'd like to put inside the grammar file that aren't naturally part of
	  the AST...</li>
<li>Traits seem natural, for example <code>inline</code></li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Larry</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Would like to see a lot of this being in a subset of Perl 6.</li>
<li>Any syntax you'd like to borrow from Perl 6 is fine</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>How much leeway do I have?</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Larry</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>I'd say that you have considerable leeway.</li>
<li>Get support from Perl 6 framework by some modules that define those
	  traits</li>
<li>The original Perl 6 properties idea was that if you mentioned it then
	  it springs into existence, but we decided that was a bad idea.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>That's how compiler works. [The original Perl 6 way]</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Larry</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Could define some sort of auto traits that auto-load.</li>
<li>But with Perl 6 we went with wanting to have predeclared traits,
	  even if just for typo checking</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Discussion on #parrot - compiler writers all liked the idea of having
	  traits</li>
<li>Felt natural.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Larry</strong>:</p>

<ul>


<li>Like Audrey says, "improvise".</li>
<li>I don't see any big problem with this.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>The consensus is "Would be really nice if compiler tools already
	  handled this for us"</li>
<li>This gives other optimisation possibilities down the road.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Larry</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Only concern would be divergence from Perl 6 trait syntax.</li>
<li>Specifically thinking about diverging by not having angle brackets and
	  colon</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Perl 6 compiler will only support the Perl 6 way</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Larry</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Just don't get trapped in a hole</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Will always resolve in favour of the Perl 6 way</li>
<li>I'm working on the PAST implementation and compiler tools refactor</li>
<li>Pleased with direction, no so pleased with speed, but other things
	  holding me back are now gone, so looking forward to next week</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Larry</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Working on a semantic bugbear. Working over the grammar, really high
	  level stuff.</li>
<li>Would be nice if at some point this reconnects [with the current
	  implementations]</li>

</ul>
