<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 13 February 2008.  Larry, Allison,
Jerry, Will, Richard, Patrick, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>fixed a few more bugs</li>
<li>haven't made a lot of progress this week</li>
<li>working through the CAGE tasks Will gave me</li>
<li>talked with Allison about the garbage collector</li>
<li>going to ask Coverity about resuming their scans</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>continue to work on the item/list assignment semantics in F<STD.pm></li>
<li>pretty much have the longest-token autolexer working, using tagged regular expressions</li>
<li>it takes about 10 CPU minutes running Pugs to calculate an autolexer for a noun</li>
<li>I can speed that up greatly by caching</li>
<li>mostly that's because Pugs is very slow</li>
<li>thought about the relationship of autothreading with only subs</li>
<li>multi subs use multiple dispatch naturally to autothread on Junctions</li>
<li>but only subs are not multiply dispatched by definition</li>
<li>figuring out a way to do that without putting the overhead of multiple dispatch on normal calls</li>
<li>there's no Undef type anymore</li>
<li>there are many varieties of <code>Undef</code>, such as Object or Failure</li>
<li>the <code>undef</code> keyword remains; it returns the most general type of Failure</li>
<li>S03 doesn't talk about associativity much, so I specced that for most operators</li>
<li>did some thinking about modules that do language tweaks</li>
<li>I think we should do strict versioning of modules in the official library when they do language tweaks</li>
<li>you have to specify the exact version number when you pull one in</li>
<li>we know exactly which language you get then</li>
<li>this is for the benefit of tool writers</li>
<li>a tool can know which version of the language it has by the version without having to pull in the module</li>
<li>this requirement is much looser for your own modules; mostly applies by default to the standard library</li>
<li>watching putter do a hand-translation of the standard grammar to Ruby</li>
<li>he's finding some things to patch</li>
<li>continuing to stay out of my own thread on pluralization :)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>spent the last week in the hospital with Paula</li>
<li>nothing's wrong, but they just wouldn't let her go home</li>
<li>catching up on email the past couple of days</li>
<li>responded to the lexicals question</li>
<li>writing a short report on the grant progress in the next couple of days</li>
<li>hope to be back working on that this week</li>
<li>need to review the changes to the system in detail from the past few weeks</li>
<li>going to postpone the release from next Tuesday to next Wednesday</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>had a couple of conversations with Larry and ruoso about SMOP</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>spent the weekend at the SCALE conference</li>
<li>made some interesting contacts for Parrot and TPF funding</li>
<li>one more bug in the PMC parser for attributes</li>
<li>it parses and generates the attribute structs fine, but fails to parse the rest of the file</li>
<li>working on the security PDD; due in a few days</li>
<li>talked to Chris Shiflett at Foo Camp</li>
<li>he had some good ideas</li>
<li>Rasmus had some good ideas for security hooks too</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>David Fetter is a good contact too</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll be at Frozen Perl this weekend</li>
<li>the hallway development track mostly</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>trying to keep on track of RT tickets</li>
<li>assigned a few to chromatic</li>
<li>trying to track the progress of the MacPorts for the 0.5.2 release</li>
<li>appears stalled; can't seem to find the original maintainer</li>
<li>may be able to stake my claim in the next week</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Richard:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>spent a few days at the MoneyTech conference</li>
<li>wanted to see how deeply the finance world is into Perl</li>
<li>made some efforts to start things up with regard to sponsorship</li>
<li>talked to a guy from Intel who was there to talk about parallelization</li>
<li>working on a followup conversation there</li>
<li>looking into upcoming conferences: EclipseCon, LSB conference</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>would that copying GC scheme help us with the <code>copy</code> opcode?</li>
<li>if you have a way to collapse reference transparently, you can pass through access to the old PMC to the new PMC</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we haven't decided whether that copying scheme is a pre 1.0 or post 1.0 feature</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>seems like 1.2 to me</li>
</ul></p>
