<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 16 April 2008.  Larry, Allison,
Jerry, Will, Nicholas, Jesse, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the release went pretty smoothly</li>
<li>had some help</li>
<li>the <code>make release</code> target is broken on Windows, and that's the only platform I had out here</li>
<li>we'll fix that before the next release from Windows</li>
<li>talking to Andy Armstrong about getting Test::Harness to 3.0 and subclass TAP::Parser so that we can report Rakudo's fudge tests better</li>
<li>every fudged test is a failure right now, even if all subtests pass</li>
<li>I talked Jonathan into implementing simple MMD in Rakudo</li>
<li>chromatic wrote about it</li>
<li>but it's broken in the release (and only the release)</li>
<li>put some work into internationalization</li>
<li>need to figure out the make rules</li>
<li>then I can put more work into localization too</li>
<li>trying to secure the parrot.org domain too</li>
<li>TPF is likely to get five slots for GSoC</li>
<li>some will be Parrot and Perl 6 related</li>
<li>the official announcement is on Monday</li>
<li>trying to encourage others to take on responsibility</li>
<li>seems to be working</li>
<li>some of the committers I've mentored are becoming mentors themselves</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>mostly reviewing different things</li>
<li>working with Jonathan on his various objects and MMD implementations</li>
<li>will check in my Rakudo milestones document tonight or tomorrow morning</li>
<li>cleaning up bug reports, closing tickets, catching up on patches</li>
<li>need to spend a little more time on paying work this week</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>trying to get the most recent release bundled as a macport</li>
<li>there's apparently a build issue since the previous macport</li>
<li>should have an easy way to install Rakudo as <code>perl6</code> after that gets straightened out too</li>
<li>still trying to cut dead things out of Parrot</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>poked at optimizations per Patrick's request</li>
<li>sped up OO and Rakudo by about 40%</li>
<li>not as much as I wanted, but you notice it</li>
<li>looked at a few more optimizations, but they're bigger and take more work</li>
<li>GC is the biggest, so let's hope we get that as one of the GSoC projects</li>
<li>think I can get the profiling core to emit Callgrind-compatible output for PIR</li>
<li>I know mostly how to do it now</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>spending a lot of time tweaking a new laptop and getting it all set up and customized nicely</li>
<li>feebly trying to keep up with the onslaught in p6l</li>
<li>I haven't been keeping up, but I'm keeping my eye out for things going off track badly</li>
<li>plotting how to get rid of TRE as my longest token matcher</li>
<li>want something that will scale better</li>
<li>the handwriting was on the wall the first time I went in it with the debugger</li>
<li>for the regex matching where a token is expected, TRE was allocating 17 MB on the stack</li>
<li>I have some ideas for something with better semantics and less memory usage</li>
<li>TRE optimizes for running one regex a lot over a lot of data, rather than running a lot of regexes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>spent a lot of time in discussions about funding Perl 5 hackers</li>
<li>I see Fran&ccedil;ois Perrad has released a Win32 binary of Parrot</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>he's been doing that for the past few releases</li>
<li>just a release in binary form, not a fork or branch</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>what's the status of Parrot in Debian?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>one final build bug in IA-64</li>
<li>the guy with the box should be getting to it this week</li>
<li>we're planning to put up the 0.6.0 release</li>
<li>if it doesn't go soon, I'll just put the F<.deb>s on the site</li>
<li>we might put IA-64 builds on our platform wishlist</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we need someone who knows how to fix them too</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it was a PGE bug unrelated to the arch, I think, in 0.4.0</li>
<li>we just need the bug confirmed fixed on that arch for Debian</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>PAUSE kinda stinks</li>
<li>I hate that we don't know if we'll have an authorized release of Parrot until it gets uploaded</li>
<li>PARROTRE lacks permissions on eight modules</li>
<li>all of which have been refactored on something else</li>
<li>they're all related to the configure or test system</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we don't have to distribute through PAUSE</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we should not index those modules anyway</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>they're not that useful outside of Parrot anyway</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the release link on the Parrotcode site, http://www.parrotcode.org/release/devel, links to the CPAN download</li>
<li>there's a lag between the update and the availability</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we could upload to Parrotcode first</li>
<li>upload to the CPAN from that site</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm not sure why we should index the <code>config::*</code> modules</li>
<li>the only ones I care about are in <code>Parrot::Embed</code></li>
</ul></p>
