<p><p>I've released a <a href="http://wgz.org/chromatic/perl/Test-MockObject.tar.gz">new version</a> of Test::MockObject.  One of the nice things about documenting your code (or, I suppose, writing an article about it) is that if you find something you really don't want to explain, or cannot explain simply, it's usually a good sign that you need to rethink the bits in question.</p>
<p>
Besides that, <a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> and his company have been using the module for testing their wacky deadline POS project.  They've found some bugs too (a couple of them just after I did), and he has suggested some improvements that made their way into version 0.07.  I'm pretty happy with the idea of next_call(), as it'll make some of my test code even shorter and easier to write.
</p>
<p>
It's also nice to have other people using my code.  I like knowing that, for example, the printable display on a Slash-based site runs on code I wrote.  As I told one of my students last night, "I like the idea that I've earned the right to use the free software I've been using."

<ul><li><i> "I like the idea that I've earned the right to use the free software I've been using."<br></i></li> </ul>  <br> <p>I like this ethic, I really do, but doesn't it imply that those who can't contribute have no 'right' to use the software?<br> </p><p>I guess you could extend this such that those who don't contribute to free software directly have a responsibility to use it, report bugs and spread the word.  That's how they give back.</p>

<p>I try to apply that ethic only to myself, but if my students pick up on it, that's also good.  If someone's using something I've written, I would like to know.  If there's a problem, a bug description or even a patch is nice.  If it works, I'm ecstatic to hear that it's saving time and trouble.</p>
<p>
Maybe I'm just restating the idea of "giving back".  Certainly knowing what it takes to get even a small piece of free software tested, written, documented, and packaged makes me more patient with other authors.

Yeah, but Slash::Print sucked, I had to rewrite the whole thing.<br> <br>&nbsp;<br> <br>&nbsp;<br> <br>&nbsp;<br> <br>&nbsp;<br>Just kidding.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  Thanks!
