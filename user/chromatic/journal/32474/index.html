<p><p>I hate uninformed advocacy almost as much as I hate foolishness.  Here's my scorecard for <a href="http://uberconcept.com/articles/perl_article.htm">Why perl is a bad language</a>.  The author:</p>

<ul>

<li>Conflates reading speed with comprehension.</li>
<li>Elevates syntax above all other concerns of understanding such as naming conventions, API familiarity, and problem domain.</li>
<li>Argues from a very selective consensus from other programming languages.</li>
<li>Mentions but immediately dismisses the value of a specific area of customization despite the fact that it leads to less punctuation.</li>
<li>Weighs the experience of dilettantes much more heavily than serious users.</li>
<li>Fails to understand the difference between string and numeric comparisons.</li>
<li>Uses the phrase <em>weakly typed</em> as if it had any discernable meaning, without bothering to give even a local definition.</li>
<li>Demonstrates a stunning lack of familiarity with anything besides a static structural object system.</li>
<li>Draws an arbitrary strawman line that two ways to do something is better than five without giving an example.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the plus side, at least the author spelled "Perl" correctly and didn't say anything stupid about "Why are there sigils?  That is SOOOO confusing!"</p>

<p>Final score: 2/11.</p></p>

<h2>A Never-Ending Battle</h2>

I'm glad you participate in these discussions on Slashdot, c.
<p>Generally your points don't seem to make much headway among those who have some visceral need to mock Perl -- probably no hope there -- but I expect there are many hackers like me who read your comments and gain more understanding about Perl's usefulness to a professional programmer and why it can make programming fun. I also notice that very few people argue with the points you make<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Thanks, Dave.  It feels awfully frustrating from the responses, but I'm glad to hear that some of the silent majority of non-commenters finds some benefit.</p>

Sure Perl has stuff that's wrong with it and that might make it a bad language, but the stuff in that article is just <i>weak</i>.  "Waaaah! I don't like interpolating variables! Don't make me use double quotes! Waaaah!" or "I used Perl for four years and still don't understand scalars! Math is hard! Waaaah!"<br><br>



<h2>Different is bad.</h2>

I particularly liked his argument about elsif.  I'll admit that I've always had a hard time typing elsif correctly the first time (without the extra 'e') but how is 'elif' any better.  I suppose it is shorter, if less readable, but isn't that supposed to be a bad thing?<br><br>I was also curious about his statement that "most other weakly typed languages get by just fine with using ==".  I decided to look up PHP as an example.  It seems that PHP does use == for all types but they had to add === to distinguish "equal" (same value) from "identical" (equal and same type).<br><br>Much of this guy's argument seems to be that Perl is bad because it is different than some other languages he has used.<br><br>BTW, here is my favorite anti-"Pearl" article:<br><a href="http://www.adequacy.org/public/stories/2001.12.20.165434.32.html" title="adequacy.org">http://www.adequacy.org/public/stories/2001.12.20.165434.32.html</a adequacy.org>

<p>At least he didn't use the word "intuitive", which as far as I can tell means only slightly more than "strong typing" or "weak typing".</p>
