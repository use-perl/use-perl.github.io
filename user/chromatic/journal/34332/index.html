<p><blockquote><em>PHP for all intents and purposes replaced Perl &amp; CGI several years ago for web development because Perl programmers got tired of doing things at such a low level and decided that there has to be a better and easier way to do things. PHP took much of the mundane tasks of web development such as handling GET and POST requests, Cookies, and Sessions effectively. It also streamlined database queries, made it easy to send text based email, and now supports dozens of plugins such as GD to manipulate images, OpenSSL, etc.</em></blockquote>

<p>I can only assume that this entry has fallen through a crack between our universe and one where declaring variables and calling <code>param()</code> is a Sisyphean burden, perhaps one that grinds up London orphans faster than a bootblack factory running triple shifts.</p>

<p>(Silly me, I thought PHP's popularity was that small children, the wicked at heart, little yippy dogs, and you, yes you, could install any random PHP 3 "Please Root Me Harder" bulletin board on your $2 a month webhost just by dropping a file in a directory.)</p>

<p>This mythical other universe has <em>dozens</em> of plugins?  I'm switching right now!  (I could double that number.  I might even explain to them what "procedural" means.  I'd be a king among men, or at least the barely-competent monkeys they have writing articles.)</p></p>

<h2>Why...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lbr/">lbr</a> on 2007-09-04T10:06:44</h3>
...bother attacking his ignorance on Perl, when the rest of the article amply demonstrates he's ignorant on most things.<p>Write what you know, indeed.</p><p>40 hours to set up an apache?  On a c64 maybe.</p>



<h2>Sisyphean....</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2007-09-04T12:05:09</h3>
I am rolling that around my intellectual pallet and yes...I find it good.  : )<br/><br/>Nice word...

I maintain that Sisyphus is the patron saint of sysadmins.<br><br>I could also be talked into including maintenance programmers as well.

I tend to think of Sisyphus as the god of Perl 6 development.<br><br>

... not that any self-respecting god would ever have anything to do with Perl 6 development.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<h2>As Rasmus explained to me...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2007-09-05T01:02:08</h3>
... when we just happened to end up at the same table at Linux.Conf.Au.<br><br>"PHP lets people that aren't programmers make dynamic web pages"<br><br>Which pretty much sums it up for me.<br><br>PHP lets a dentist or a environmental scientist with a copy of dreamweaver make a simple web application.<br><br>And that's what Rasmus was most proud of (and I agree, for that it's great).<br><br>It's the same pride we have sometimes that sysadmin types (the specific subset can't code much and just dabble in Perl) can string together half a dozen CPAN modules and make something unmaintainable that actually works.<br>

<h2>Re:As Rasmus explained to me...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2007-09-05T06:10:55</h3>
<p>I'm fine with all of that.  It's the very selective rewriting of history (none of which I've <em>ever</em> seen or heard from Rasmus or any of the other PHP gurus I know) that I find objectionable.</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/azkul/">azkul</a> on 2007-09-06T17:15:28</h3>
Thank you for your honest commentary of my posting.  I've rewritten it to get my point across, and hopefully it now is technically correct.  It wasn't my intention to disrespect the Perl community, and hopefully it is worded better to explain what I was trying to say.
<br>
Thanks,<br>

<p>Excellent!  The revision is much clearer, and I find it much more correct.  (I still have points of disagreement in places, but they're mostly legitimate differences of opinion.)</p>
