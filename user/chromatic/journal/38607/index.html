<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 04 March 2009.  Larry, Allison, Patrick, Jerry, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>still in my manic phase here</li>
<li>fixed a bunch of bugs in STD</li>
<li>placeholder variables now declare their corresponding variables</li>
<li>assumes when it sees a function name with the sigil that it doens't have to look it up</li>
<li>postdeclaration of a function now looks in the correct pad</li>
<li>the same name might occur in different pads, so it might mean different things in different places</li>
<li>you have to do the patchup starting in the correct lexical scope</li>
<li>put in a nice error message when someone tries to index the <code>-1</code> element of an array</li>
<li>the parsing on a file is now localized better</li>
<li>can do multiple parses without information leaking from one parse to the next</li>
<li>redid the number matching rule</li>
<li>we can theoretically reuse that for parsing numbers in converting strings to numeric values at runtime</li>
<li>as you extend your grammar with different kinds of numeric literals, you can reuse that</li>
<li>the builtins should be able to do rational and complex numbers</li>
<li>can parse some of the compile-time variables specified</li>
<li>you can give them meaning, such as the current line number</li>
<li>fixed a bug in <code>__END__</code> where it tried to parse the POD/data section</li>
<li>killed off <code>is also</code> and <code>is instead</code></li>
<li>now there are scoped declarators: <code>augment</code> and <code>supersede</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>why?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>they're not declaring a new thing in the scope</li>
<li>attaching to something that already exists</li>
<li>not really a declaration at all in that sense</li>
<li>the traits had to go out and change the meaning of the name retroactively</li>
<li>you can throw declaration names into the symbol table</li>
<li>but if you hit <code>is also</code>, you had to undo that to reuse a name that's already out there</li>
<li>they wanted to be scoped declarators instead</li>
<li>needed to be able to write some of our multimethods more generically than they were by default</li>
<li>when referring to other multimethods of the same name</li>
<li>needed to do that by the semantics of the caller's scope</li>
<li>we added a primitive called <code>lift</code></li>
<li>it's a statement prefix, like <code>gather</code></li>
<li>slightly genericizes that statement</li>
<li>uses the semantics of the caller to handle the operators</li>
<li>took out all mention of the <code>TOP</code> macro</li>
<li>now talks about <code>.parse</code> and <code>.parsefile</code> on grammars</li>
<li>you can't use a grammar on the right side of a smart match</li>
<li>it's treated as a type name</li>
<li>refactored the definition of <code>capture</code> and <code>match</code></li>
<li>instead of magical semantics in <code>Item</code> context, now it's invariant that a match in <code>Item</code> context is just itself</li>
<li>result objects are no longer a magical part of a <code>Match</code> object</li>
<li>passed back through the named null-string key</li>
<li>can still refer to it with <code>$()</code> but it comes through a different mechanism</li>
<li>not confused with positional arguments</li>
<li>invocant always considered the first positional argument of a capture</li>
<li>marked with a colon, if anybody cares</li>
<li>this will simplify semantics in many places</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>in shock over the changes to the spec in the past week, but we'll deal with it</li>
<li>most of it will be the <code>Item</code> stuff</li>
<li>it needs to happen though</li>
<li>big news is the first independent release of Rakudo last Thursday</li>
<li>release #14, codename Vienna</li>
<li>feedback is that it works great</li>
<li>it's accumulated a lot of changes through February to the build system</li>
<li>since the release, fixed some longstanding parser headaches in Rakudo</li>
<li>most notably the handling of <code>if</code>, <code>unless</code>, and <code>while</code></li>
<li>added the <code>Q</code> quoting operator and some of its variants</li>
<li>fixed up <code>is export</code> handling for code written in the core <code>Setting</code></li>
<li>we can use it there to export into the correct place in programs</li>
<li>needs a little work, but the basics seem to work</li>
<li>planning and scoping how to convert more builtins to Perl 6 in the core <code>Setting</code></li>
<li>replied to an article about converting HOP's RPN calculator to Perl 6</li>
<li>wrote my own version of the converter</li>
<li>Andy Lester and I have worked on redesigning rakudo.org</li>
<li>inviting other people to contribute</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it looks really good</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm inviting others to contribute</li>
<li>fixed a couple of minor Parrot bugs</li>
<li>putting together a guide for people who want to submit patches now that we've switched over to Git</li>
<li>Github's presentation of the patch queue can be difficult to work with as a free-for-all</li>
<li>we're putting together some strict guidelines on that</li>
<li>blocking on how quickly I can acquire Git knowledge</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>spent most of my week on OSCON planning</li>
<li>that's almost wrapped up</li>
<li>worked a lot on bugfixing and ticket closing</li>
<li>that'll be my focus for the rest of the week</li>
<li>working on Debian and Ubuntu packaging</li>
<li>no real new development</li>
<li>just making sure we get things as clean as possible before the release</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>people in Vienna seem to be chuffed about the release name</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's positive, right?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>whether it's positive or not, there's little I can do now</li>
<li>the feedback about the release names has been uniformly positive</li>
<li>"Hey, that's great!"</li>
<li>"How do I get my group in the list?"</li>
<li>that was the point</li>
<li>Andy Lester gets credit for that idea</li>
<li>thinking lately that I'd like to move the specs and tests out of the pugscode repo</li>
<li>or change the name of the repository</li>
<li>seems to confuse people that the tests and specs are in the Pugs repository, but they probably don't want to use Pugs as the primary implementation</li>
<li>I've already claimed the Perl 6 account on Github</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>reducing confusion is a good idea</li>
<li>but until the confusion is reduced on how to submit a patch to Rakudo, this may not be the time</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I expect that confusion to be gone within a week</li>
<li>don't think that's a difficult problem to solve</li>
<li>it'd be different from Rakudo</li>
<li>you'd get a commit bit for the spectests by asking for it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>maybe talk to Audrey and the other implementors</li>
<li>see if you can get a consensus</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I don't want to do anything by fiat</li>
<li>that might argue for merely changing the canonical name of the repository</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>what's the practicality of extracting version history from the SVN history when importing to Github?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's easy</li>
<li>we did that with Rakudo</li>
<li>Jesse prototyped it in 15 minutes and sent me instructions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>might be good to have tutorials and sessions on contributing to Rakudo</li>
<li>when thinking about how to make our users smart enough to deal with SVN for Parrot and Git for Rakudo</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>my talk this year is "Hacking Rakudo"</li>
<li>it's not "Status of Rakudo" anymore</li>
<li>the nuts and bolts of becoming a Rakudo contributor</li>
<li>at Oslo, Jonathan is talking about Perl 6 and Rakudo Today</li>
<li>we'll put a little Git tutorial in there</li>
<li>I have 100 minutes for that talk</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that all sounds fine to me</li>
<li>a go-slow, two-step process is probably best</li>
<li>change the name first, then move over to Git</li>
<li>that sounds fine</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'll discuss these ideas now on p6c</li>
<li>what should our policy be for contributor agreements and commit bits?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>TPF's perspective is that it's valuable to continue requiring a contributor agreement for a commit bit</li>
<li>that policy is important for the future</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>is there a summary of why that's important?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>this makes it safer for companies like IBM to use Rakudo in production environments</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>basically avoiding a SCO</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>yes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we'll probably continue the Parrot-style policy</li>
<li>who gets those CLAs when they get sent in now?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I've been collecting them</li>
<li>may eventually hand it off to Jim Brandt</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I agree with the <code>Item</code> changes, but there's a bit of a conundrum for NQP</li>
<li>we used <code>$(...)</code> to get the <code>Result</code> object out</li>
<li>any suggestions?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's just the name of the objects inside</li>
<li>need to change that to a method call or something explicitly the null key</li>
<li>or we could make it respond to function <code>.()</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that sounds fine to me</li>
<li>does <code>$(...)</code> have any specific meaning we need to preserve now?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>only the form with bare parens remaps to the null key</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>could we say that this is a special form which translates to a method call?</li>
<li>I'm not arguing strongly for that</li>
<li>I don't like the inconsistency</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's often enough you want the value that it should be short and sweet</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I can support an older version in NQP</li>
<li>it's not tied so directly to Perl 6</li>
<li>just need to know what the new syntax should be</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there needs to be some productive postfix syntax</li>
<li>whether that looks like a subroutine invocation or a method call... still need to figure that out</li>
<li>right now, a hash subscript for <code>''</code> is spec'd to work</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that'd be <code>${''}</code>, which combined with a match object such as <code>$&lt;bar&gt;</code> makes it <code>$&lt;bar&gt;{''}</code>?</li>
<li>that's an ugly pill</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>a null subscript in angle brackets</li>
<li>comes up to a null list, but if we forced it...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>but it gets the whole list</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>nevermind that idea then</li>
<li>need to think about <code>$()</code> some more</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>how about <code>$&lt;bar&gt;&lt;*&gt;</code>?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that ought to mean the star key</li>
<li>instead of using the null key every where, we'll use the star key</li>
<li>that might be a good idea</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I don't need an immediate answer</li>
<li>it'd be nice to solve this before Parrot 1.0</li>
</ul></p>
