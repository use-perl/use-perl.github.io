<h2>Are you sure it's not PERL6</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmcada/">jmcada</a> on 2007-01-20T06:52:25</h3>
Okay, so the subject is a little bit of a joke, but I can see where people (including myself) can find themselves writing things like Perl vs. Perl6.  For some reason, I think of Perl 6 as something that maintains the spirit of Perl, but takes it to a new level beyond just a version change.  This very well might not be true, but it is my perceived view of Perl 6.  Unfortunately, the best example that comes to mind is VB vs. VB.Net.  Sure, we noticed difference between VB 5 and VB 6, but VB.Net, now, that was a fundamental change (and a PITA to port).  Likewise, I can envision Perl 5.10 coming out and Perl 6 coming out and people looking at them as two different languages.  Could there be a Perl 6 and a Perl 5.12?  Is this what you guys want?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  At least you don't have to lie and call Perl 5.10 Perl10 (cough, Java2).
<br> <br>
Really, I don't have much of an opinion on how we should address the language(s).  It sounds like you are leaning toward just recognizing Perl 6 as the next major version of Perl.  Fine by me, I'll just have to do a little find-and-replace<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>All I meant is that writing anything other than "Perl 5" or "Perl 6" looks awful; especially without the crucial space character.</p>
