<div class="span8">
<p>The Perl 6 design team has a weekly phone call to discuss the state of the project.  Here are my notes from today's meeting.<br/><br/>Allison:
	- mainly going through PDDs
	- some auxiliary conversations going on around those
	- one interesting one with Audrey yesterday
	- Vishal is looking into some of the proposed IMCC refactorings
	- I'm glad to have him looking into it
	- hope to bless the exceptions PDD by the end of the week
	- that's one milestone to knock off of the list<br/><br/>Larry:
	- starting to recover from Chicago
	- whacking away on the Synopses still
	- making clarifications
	- paying attention to the trainers when they carp about things that are
	  hard to teach
	- first we paid attention to the original Perl users carping
	- now we're paying attention to the implementors
	- we are starting to pay attention to the trainers
	- things that are hard to pronounce
	- maybe rename the pipe operator so as not to conflict with Unix pipes
	- talking to Damian about using signature notation to process arguments
	  coming into a process
	- rather than having multiple versions of Getopt
	- the exact syntax is indeterminate now
	- what if you want to multidispatch to your main()?
	- lots of things to consider there
	- just keeping my ear open on #perl6<br/><br/>c:
	- managed to get Parrot embedded and working from Perl 5 and Ruby
	- need some fixes to Parrot to make it work for the test suite
	- I may just check in the Perl 5 bindings<br/><br/>Nicholas:
	- some comments on my journal entry about Ponie<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- I need to write a Perl 6 project update to clarify some of the recent
	  changes<br/><br/>Nicholas:
	- chatted with Audrey about the semantics of Data::Bind
	- it does aliasing and read-only aliasing with magic
	- it won't work for the corner cases
	- the problem is Perl 5's scalar flag bits
	- there's a public and a private flag in Perl 5.6
	- in 5.8, I added new meanings to the private flag for the non-magic case
	- they have different meanings whether a scalar is magic
	- effectively you need three bits worth of information
	- I think the module will have corner cases with regard to large integers
	  and blessing<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- will there need to be a core change for this to work?<br/><br/>Nicholas:
	- yes, but it's a risk
	- some companies asked about speeding up Perl 5
	- not sure what the strategy is there
	- a lot of the problems are unbound
	- can plug in the Perl 5.10 regex engine
	- might dual-life that for Perl 5.8.1 and later soon<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- I've suggested that Rafael move to monthly 5.9.x releases
	- some Pugs folks have offered to help with delegatable tasks
	- oh, last night the Pugs folks managed to use v6.pm to translate the Perl
	  6 Test.pm to somewhat idiomatic Perl 5<br/><br/>Nicholas:
	- have we found someone to do Perl 6 summaries?<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- Ann Barcomb popped up to volunteer
	- Audrey will help her with that for a couple of weeks
	- we shall see summaries resume in the next little while
	- it should include things discussed on IRC<br/><br/>Larry:
	- will there be pressure to fork a 5.11 off of a 5.9 before a 5.10 comes
	  out?<br/><br/>Nicholas:
	- I thought the same thing at times
	- you don't want to destabilize your 5.10<br/><br/>Jesse:
	- most of what the Pugs 5 people have said is that they're using loopholes
	  as if they were APIs
	- they want canonicalization of those
	- they're optimizing for fun and not production readiness, so they're fine
	  with using loopholes for now</p>

<h2>FP</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2006-07-06T02:34:34</h3>
Should be promoted to the front page.



<h2>Wiki?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ChrisDolan/">ChrisDolan</a> on 2006-07-06T05:33:07</h3>
Perhaps this should be in a wiki instead of a journal?  I'd like to see an URL for Nicholas' comment about Ponie in his journal.  I can't find the comments to which he refers...<br>



<h2>Formatting</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2006-07-08T14:01:49</h3>
I find it remarkable that in this day and age, in a group of talented programmers that use a programming language very well suited for building a text format converter, that people not only write their notes in plain text using a fixed-width font and hard wraps, but also publish it that way. With as a result, that some lines wrap badly, due to incompatible line lengths. (And it looks terrible. But that may be just my sense of esthetics.)<br><br>The formatting you used reminds me a bit of YAML, but as the latter claims not to be a markup language, but a data storage specification, it probably shouldn't be (ab)used to build a converter with.<br><br>What gives? That we're not as advanced as we hope we would be.

<p>What gives is that the more work it is for me to publish the notes, the less likely I'll do it.</p>

<p>I'm sure it would be trivial to build a converter for this format, but I preferred to spend my time actually putting the notes online.</p>

<p>I'm sure a really talented amenuensis could type the notes with lovely formatting in another format, but I just don't type that fast.  This is a compromise between accuracy, completeness, and aesthetics.  (Actually, I don't care about aesthetics beyond readability.)</p>
