<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 05 September 2007.  Larry, Allison, Patrick, Jesse, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>talked to Flavio Glock at YAPC::Eu</li>
<li>he asked whether P5 consistently converts from int to float and string and such</li>
<li>we're not sure if it works reliably; Perl 6 needs it</li>
<li>he's at least asking the right questions in the right places</li>
<li>Perl 6 might have trouble with this, thanks to C89 at least</li>
<li>Aaron Crane has a Perl 5 module which lets you use <code>each</code> on arrays</li>
<li>I talked to Larry and Damian about this</li>
<li>I found a nice way to make <code>each</code> work on Perl 5 arrays</li>
<li>couldn't bribe Rafael to put it into 5.10, so maybe 5.12</li>
<li>what should make it in is <code>state</code></li>
<li>there were two bugs in the original implementation though</li>
<li>one is that if you assigned the return value of a subroutine to a <code>state</code> variable, that sub gets called repeatedly</li>
<li>they're <code>START</code> blocks in Perl 6 right?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>yes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I have it doing the right thing then</li>
<li><code>my $a = state $b = foo()</code> also works</li>
<li>I believe I have it working the way the Perl 6 spec has it</li>
<li>I don't think Pugs does it right yet</li>
<li>it's only for scalar assignment though</li>
<li>Rafael likes the patch</li>
<li>Abigail is working on corner cases</li>
<li>this might get in for 5.10</li>
<li>the list assignment version is hard</li>
<li>it's not going to happen for 5.10</li>
<li>no guarantee the whole thing will go in, but it looks promising</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>getting over my jetlag from Vienna</li>
<li>mostly thinking about compiling patterns</li>
<li>my cheater program splits the standard grammar rules into longest token parts and action parts</li>
<li>I need more to work on the spec</li>
<li>need a way of returning the DFA-able pattern</li>
<li>I can separately address the action from the prefix token now</li>
<li>if I had an implementation of a DFA over many alternatives, it could tell me which rule to call</li>
<li>I could configure that rule without having to reparse</li>
<li>a DFA can't do some sort of assertions, so there might be retroactive reparsing at the end of a token match</li>
<li>those are fairly infrequent</li>
<li>now I'm just trying to figure out the right semantics for interfacing to that matcher</li>
<li>talked some with Damian last week about regularizations to pattern matching syntax</li>
<li>not happy with the suppress-capture question mark on rules</li>
<li>ought to be the opposite of bang</li>
<li>if bang doesn't have any width, question mark shouldn't either</li>
<li>looking at other characters to slip in there</li>
<li>various other clunkinesses in there from when we had some metacharacters and not others</li>
<li>with the recent policy change that all punctuation is all potentially metacharacter, some notations are overkill</li>
<li>particuarly binding</li>
<li>looking for cleaner alternatives</li>
<li>we might get a notation out of that that lets us declare match variables</li>
<li><code>my</code> variables scoped to a part of the match</li>
<li>also possible to put the binding out on the right, instead of to the left</li>
<li>especially when passing parameters to a closure</li>
<li>playing with a lot of different syntaxes</li>
<li>haven't really settled on one yet</li>
<li>lots of ways to go wrong with that</li>
<li>might restrict the colon-binding to setting pre-existing variables</li>
<li>corresponding with Wolfgang Laun who's been going through S02 and beyond</li>
<li>looking at them from a different angle</li>
<li>he's pointed out some of the infelicities in the design</li>
<li>I'm thinking about some of them</li>
<li>currently we distinguish between the <code>of</code> type and the <code>as</code> type</li>
<li>the <code>as</code> type isn't that useful anymore</li>
<li>if people really want to lie about the return type, maybe they can put their conversions on themselves</li>
<li>the long dot stuff is mostly historical; all there is is unspace</li>
<li>simplifications like that</li>
<li>also the kp6 folks are getting pretty close to having it bootstrapped in itself</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I took this last week off</li>
<li>the week before that I spent a lot of time working on NQP</li>
<li>we added quite a few more things: <code>for</code>, looping</li>
<li>what's left is having variables within namespaces and handling return exceptions and various sorts of exceptions</li>
<li>running into places where the irregularities of Parrot's opcodes are getting in my way</li>
<li>grabbing the variable from a namespace takes a different type of parameter</li>
<li>have to rework POST a bit to deal with that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>how much of that can get regularized in Parrot?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I have no strong suggestions for fixing it within Parrot at the moment</li>
<li>POST is just going to have to deal with it</li>
<li>it does add some complexity</li>
<li>I'm just going to implement something that works, and someone may have to come along later and clean it up</li>
<li>after that, NQP will be done</li>
<li>I can get back to Perl 6</li>
<li>lots of things are blocking on this one piece of getting namespaces to work</li>
<li>being able to run code in mod_parrot and use Parrot libraries will work after this</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>finished the mod_perl 2 book</li>
<li>went straight onto Vienna</li>
<li>spent a good bit of time with Jonathan and helping people at the hackathon</li>
<li>checked in some of the work from that</li>
<li>some I still need to go over</li>
<li>Dakkar gave me a Perl 5 prototype of the next step for TGE</li>
<li>not just matching based on the type of the node, but full-featured matching based on node attributes and children</li>
<li>also gave me a Perl 5 prototype of doing the automatic recursion into the next level of the tree</li>
<li>need to translate that into PIR and integrate it into TGE</li>
<li>need to finish the object model</li>
<li>it's kinda frustrating</li>
<li>the old code is pretty messy</li>
<li>lots of cleanup there</li>
<li>also working on the PMC PDD</li>
<li>it really just needs one final thorough pass</li>
<li>then we can move it out of draft</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>doing some minor cleanup on all of the PMCs</li>
<li>mostly just tidying</li>
<li>but I've deleted some old code</li>
<li>have three things to work on: HLL, GC, vtable lookup but blocking on PDD 15 there</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jesse:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>some of the microgrants have been paid</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>is it time to branch for PDD 15?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>yes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it wouldn't help me</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm spending a lot of time working around the old object model</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm having to work around the old model and deal with the new</li>
<li>it might be nice to rip all of the bandages off</li>
<li>there'll be a great deal of hurt</li>
<li>sooner is better than later</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the more I look, the more I realize that we can't keep the old model around</li>
<li>it's just too badly broken</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I could care less about the old object model</li>
<li>whatever gets the new one implemented quickest works for me</li>
<li>the tools I'm building will use the new one and only the new one</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>unless I can keep the branch only about two weeks old, then keeping things up to date might be more work than not branching</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm less convinced of that</li>
<li>I haven't seen a lot of changes in the past six weeks that have touched object producers or consumers</li>
<li>shouldn't be as difficult to merge in that sense</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>okay, I should be able to make a public branch on Monday</li>
<li>probably will use SVK to do the merges from trunk though</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>p5p is still grumbling about <code>dor</code> and <code>err</code></li>
<li>no one can work out why you like <code>err</code>, Larry</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's a soundalike of <code>or</code> and it has to do with error recovery</li>
<li>where you go if you err</li>
<li>it's a prettier word than <code>dor</code> too</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nicholas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's a clearer version of "<code>dor</code> is dorky"</li>
<li>Rafael and I are keen to defend Rule #1, but we've not been clear why</li>
<li>I feel uneasy about doing things differently from Perl 6</li>
<li>the peanut gallery seems to prefer <code>dor</code></li>
</ul></p>
