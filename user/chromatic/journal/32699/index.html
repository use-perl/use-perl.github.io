<p><p>Methods are not functions.  If you call a method as a function, you might get the right results and you might get the wrong results.  If the documentation shows you how to call a method as a method and you call it as a function and get the wrong results, that's your fault and you should stop doing it if you care about getting the right results consistently and reliably.</p>

<p>You should especially not file bug reports about getting the wrong results if you use the code incorrectly.</p>

<p>That is all.</p></p>

This post sends visions of CGI.pm whistling through my head<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>At least the documentation supports that operation... but a cleaner way to perform the same behavior is to export functions that operate on an automatically-generated singleton, not to try to detect a valid invocant.</p>

<p>It's funny how you mention that though, as I've written patches for CGI.pm to prevent it from breaking Liskov's substitutability principle.</p>

<h2>Response to bug report</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2007-03-15T19:49:25</h3>
<p>This is not a bug.  The documentation clearly indicates that calling $obj-&gt;routine() will return a scalar.  However, calling Package::routine() is intended to throw a fatal error.  This is exactly the results you are getting, and so it is not a bug.</p>

<p>:)</p>

<p>It's where you look over the three items of the <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jdavidb/journal/12638" title="perl.org">bug report formula</a perl.org> and verify that when the action described in point 1 is taken, the results described in point 3 are correct, and that the expectation described in point 2 is wrong.</p>



<h2>Eek!  The memories!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/drhyde/">drhyde</a> on 2007-03-16T11:24:17</h3>
One of the biggest mistakes I've made in my stuff on the CPAN is that in Number::Phone and Number::Phone::UK everything can be called as either an object method, a class method, or as a function.  Yuck.  Add to that that most of the functions (being almost identical, just lookups in a database or calls through to another module) are auto-generated at run-time, and it's a screaming nightmare.

<p>They really need a re-write.</p>
