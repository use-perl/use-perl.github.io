<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 20 February 2008.  Larry, Allison, Patrick, Jerry, Will, Jesse, and chromatic attended.</p>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>did a few small things in Rakudo over this week</li>
<li>nothing spectacular or amazing</li>
<li>will do the Parrot release later this evening</li>
<li>expect no problems</li>
<li>headed to FOSDEM in Belgium tomorrow to talk about Perl 6</li>
<li>I should have some hacking time on airplanes</li>
<li>very little chance of being interrupted</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>other than having the flu...</li>
<li>doing various spec things</li>
<li>documented what identifier extensions are</li>
<li>straightened out the little mess in role composition as to the difference between role private attributes and the composed class's private attributes</li>
<li>something declared with <code>has</code> is intended to be used generically within the class</li>
<li>for a role private attribute, you declare it with <code>my</code></li>
<li>goes along with the use of <code>my</code> of giving private attributes (or methods at least) to classes</li>
<li>if you declare unary or zero-arity functions with a prototype in Perl 5, that changes the grammar</li>
<li>that's no longer the case in Perl 6</li>
<li>they're still parsed as list operators</li>
<li>you can define them that way if you want, but you have to do it explicitly</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>that's a tremendous amount of sanity</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>some of us get there late</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>some of us never get there</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there's a big hole as to how backslash behaves in the interpolation spec</li>
<li>what if you backslash something that isn't going to interpolate?</li>
<li>the rules are similar to Perl 5, but more generically of course</li>
<li>single-quotes assume you want to leave backslashes in</li>
<li>double-quotes assume that all backslashes are meaningful, or they're in error</li>
<li>working on how sig space interacts with <code>**</code> on a separator</li>
<li>fixing up some of the spec there</li>
<li>came up in IRC</li>
<li>the big thing this week is working on a program called <code>gimme5</code></li>
<li>chewing gum and bailing wire</li>
<li>instead of spitting out Pugs code, it spits out Perl 5 code</li>
<li>can now translate <em>STD.pm</em> to Perl 5 and run it under <code>strict</code> and <code>warnings</code></li>
<li>translated <em>cursor.pm</em> to Perl 5</li>
<li>have the longest token scanner working for small, uncomplicated rules -- just alternatives</li>
<li>need to revamp how longest-token matching works for more complicated rules</li>
<li>the match is essentially over a list of alternatives</li>
<li>given a rule that expects a term, it's zero or more prefix operators followed by a noun</li>
<li>zero-or-more implies that the longest token at that point has to be the union of what prefix and noun matches</li>
<li>it doesn't handle embedded alternations yet either</li>
<li>the next step is doing what I could not make work under Pugs</li>
<li>take the current match state and extract the match object to show to the user</li>
<li>the current match state continuation has all of that information in it scattered among a bunch of backlinks</li>
<li>it's not the form in which the user wants to access it</li>
<li>unless the subscript lookups did some sort of tie-based behavior</li>
<li>I don't want to do that</li>
<li>we can just matchify things lazily when we know we need that for the user</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>finally done with my insane conference run</li>
<li>no travel until the first week of March</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>doing a lot of work closing bugs</li>
<li>working on open tickets</li>
<li>closed a lot of them</li>
<li>fixed a lot of little things for the release</li>
<li>think I fixed one Tcl segfault</li>
<li>working on the Lua GC bug now</li>
<li>fixed up a lot of little things for the release</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>doing more work on Rakudo</li>
<li>found a weird bug that Patrick thought was GC, but it's not</li>
<li>I did find a GC bug earlier today though and submitted a ticket</li>
<li>did some other fixups for Parrot working on the release</li>
<li>hope to work on the PDD 17 branch soon</li>
<li>still have a Windows segfault there</li>
<li>building on Linux so I can help</li>
<li>started looking at gettext so we can internationalize Parrot</li>
<li>I'll check something in for the config after the release</li>
<li>after that, it's just a matter of putting in some macros and starting the conversion</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Allison:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the Linux kernel has some good hooks for i18n</li>
<li>everything gets hidden behind a layer of abstraction, so you never directly print error text</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>did a bunch of non-user-visible commits</li>
<li>coding standard updates</li>
<li>have a new contributor, Stephen Weeks</li>
<li>he's contributed to several languages</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it feels like it's time to optimize PGE</li>
<li>is that correct?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there are lots of little improvements</li>
<li>biggest improvement is probably the longest token match</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>can we avoid recursive descent with that?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>not entirely</li>
<li>but we can avoid recursing into subrules that can't possibly match</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm all for pruning trees</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>longest token matching isn't trivial</li>
<li>as Larry will tell you</li>
<li>PGE needs to be able to attach attributes to subroutines</li>
<li>I need to be able to ask a rule (or build a DFA) such that we can associate longest tokens with rules</li>
<li>ask a rule "What does your DFA look like?"</li>
<li>sounds like an attribute on a sub</li>
<li>I haven't been able to put together a clean way to do that in Parrot</li>
<li>we have subs with attributes or properties</li>
<li>but once you take them down to being PIR</li>
<li>you need a subroutine that attaches all of the properties once you load that subroutine</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm not doing it that way</li>
<li>I have an argument that's the state of the predetermination</li>
<li>there's an artificial state, <code>?</code>, that's "tell me your DFA"</li>
<li>instead of caching that in the sub/method itself, there's a per-language cache</li>
<li>if two different languages call into that rule, they can keep separate caches of their longest token matchers</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you have a way of calling a method that says "Give me your DFA" instead of "Do a match"?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>yes</li>
<li>you don't have to duplicate the dispatch</li>
<li>you get the right one</li>
<li>we don't try to duplicate the dispatch mechanism</li>
<li>we just tell it to do something different than do the match</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the grammar holds that little bit of DFA</li>
<li>keeps track of how they combine together</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>when you ask for the DFA for the particular rule, it asks its subrules</li>
<li>each of those, the autolexer automatically knows whether it's calculated that</li>
<li>it's already in the cache</li>
<li>it reuses that bit then</li>
<li>reincorporates that into a larger pattern</li>
<li>off it goes</li>
<li>the tricky thing is making sure that that cache is per-language</li>
<li>Pugs doesn't do that now</li>
<li>if you try to cache that in the sub as a property, you'd have to keep track of which language used it</li>
<li>they have different lexers</li>
<li>that's some of the motivation for simplifying the language tweaking things</li>
<li>don't want the language to tweak for every unary or zero-array function</li>
<li>I didn't want to cache duplicate lexers?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>part B of my answer is get some sort of profiling available in Parrot</li>
<li>see what subs get called and where we spend our time</li>
<li>part C is writing the Capture PMC in C</li>
<li>that's waiting on the PMC changes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we have a profile core in Parrot, <code>-p</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's based on the C level</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you want subroutines, not ops?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>yes</li>
<li>making a native Capture PMC could be a big win</li>
<li>it just redispatches to arrays and hashes</li>
<li>that deserves to be its own beast</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>do you maintain that match object on the fly as a mutable object, and back things out as you backtrack?</li>
<li>my passed-around match state is cloned, immutable objects</li>
<li>my continuation system just uses the cloned snapshot</li>
<li>it may or may not be faster</li>
<li>I know where I need to reconstruct that mutable match object that the user sees</li>
<li>that's another possible optimization/pessimization</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the match object is a convenient place to keep track of backtrack state</li>
<li>backing out is basically a delete optimization</li>
<li>I could optimize the backtracking</li>
<li>function is more important than speed for what I've done so far</li>
<li>another big win is getting strings implemented under Parrot such that we're not using UTF-8</li>
<li>that's slow</li>
<li>because of ICU and Unicode support, we're stuck with UTF-8 at the moment</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Larry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I've done enough of that in my life</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Patrick:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>as far as the code it generates, I'm sure people can come up with improvements there</li>
<li>the code itself does a lot of optimizations</li>
<li>profiling seems to be the big win</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I have some ideas there</li>
</ul></p>
