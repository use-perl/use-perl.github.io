<p><p>I'd say I <em>love</em> the responses to <a href="http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2008/12/five-features-perl-5-needs-now.html">Five Features Perl 5 Needs Now</a>, but only Schwern seems to understand that my one sentence quips rank 11 out of 10 on the 0 to 10 sarcasm scale.</p>

<p>The idea that <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Class::Accessor">Class::Accessor</a> is a substitute for a full and complete object system should debunk itself.  The notion that modules in the core can't evolve is silly.</p>

<p>"Oh, that will never work!" is exactly <em>why</em> these things never work.</p>

<p>Thanks for the stop energy.  Let's have this discussion again next year.  Someone else can start it.</p></p>

<p>I totally understand that you're an 11/10 on the sarcastic quipometer.  That's what makes you so {help,use}{ful,less}.  Well, some of those things.</p>



<h2>I assumed ...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/perigrin/">perigrin</a> on 2008-12-11T05:19:12</h3>
that you would see the sarcasm in my reply. Sorry.

<p> <a href="http://enlightened.perl.org/" title="perl.org">The Enlightned Perl Organisation</a perl.org> is trying to do exactly what I described. Take on the burden of an extended core of modules and put it onto someone other than p5p. They're taking an <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Task-Kensho/lib/Task/Kensho.pm" title="cpan.org">initial list</a cpan.org>, forming a group to vet that list, and going to build a dist around it.

</p><p>This seems like a better solution than putting the burden of chasing down more modules and their changes onto p5p. Especially since they aren't getting the <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2008/09/msg139607.html" title="perl.org">all of help they need now</a perl.org></p>

<p>I don't believe the solution is stuffing more modules in the core.  That hasn't worked, and it's not going to work.  The solution is fixing the core.  (I suppose one solution is <em>removing</em> modules from the core, but good luck with that.)</p>

<p>Um, exactly. I think we're in violent agreement. I'll shut up and go back to working on the EPO stuff then.</p>

Maybe I am mentally impaired but I am confused.  Does this mean they were silly ideas and you are sick of hearing about them or they are good ideas and you are sick of the stop energy?
