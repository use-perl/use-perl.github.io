I found a few stray tuits under the couch this evening and added the missing 
interface sanity tests (and fixed a bug that they revealed :-) to 
XML::SAX::Base-- finally bringing it to release worthiness.
</p>
<p>
Wheeeee!
</p>
<p>
It really <i>is</i> cause for celebration, actually. I've probably worked 
harder on ::Base than any other single piece of code I've ever written. Sure, 
I've had projects that required months and months of daily hacking, and 
others that were more mentally challenging, and blah, blah, blah, but my 
<i>approach</i> was different this time. Rather than rushing toward release, 
I chose to take a more careful way through; making sure that each aspect was 
thoroughly tested, and the larger whole benchmarked at every turn (what a 
concept, huh? ;-). 
</p>
<p>
Well, the slow-and-steady approach really paid off.
</p>
As it exists now, XML::SAX::Base is the all-singing, all-dancing, lighting 
fast, Perlish-in-all-the-right-ways, generically useful, SAX event 
driver/filter base class that I'd hoped it would be-- and more.
</p>
<p>
I'll pop back in later to explain the details (and why you might consider 
giving a shit even if you think XML sux) but for now I'll leave you, Gentle 
Reader, with a hearty and heart-felt. . .

<b>WOOT!</b>
