Yesterday, the Munich Perl Mongers were guests of the Munich chapter of the System Administrators Guild Europe. This invitation was much to the relief of Harald JÃÂ¶rg. He got a break from the tedious task of determining the number of attendees, needed for restaurant reservations. An amazing number of about 20 SAGEs and 10 Mongers turned up.
</p>
<p> 
The topic was 'GUI in Perl', and we even had presentations. Steffen Ulrich talked about his experiences with an homegrown competitor of SAP, written in Perl/Tk. He also did comparisons with other GUI toolkits. Tk seems to have the best impedance match with Perl, but is also the worst looking GUI toolkit.
</p>
<p>
Harald showed us a Perl/Tk project he had resurected after 8 years of banishment. He did a 3D-Designer for houses and furniture. It was jolly fun flying thru walls, all without VRML. No Doom monsters were to be seen anywhere.
</p>
<p>
Stephen Riem tooks us on tour of the darker sides of Programming, by showing a Java application for the planning of television commercials. The number of lines of code was truly frightening.

<p>Huh, I find Tk truly awful to work with. Try as I might, I could never get my scripts to look anything but horribly messy when using it.</p>

<p>In contrast, Gtk2-Perl is a joy all around. It feels <em>very</em> Perlish, all over, and the code is clean and obvious.</p>
