In the last weeks, I have been looking into dynamic PMCs in Parrot. They are not very different from Parrot core PMCs.Users just have to look up the dynamic ID, before they can create a instance.
</p>
<p>
As an example I worked on the <B>GDBMHash PMC</B>. This is a binding the GNU dbm, a file dictionary. The basic implementation was straightforward. The configuration is somewhat akward. I need to check wether 'libgdbm.so' exists. Currently I have added this check to the core Parrot configuration. It would be nicer to have a seperate configuration step for Parrot extensions. It would be cool to do that in PIR, as Parrot already exists when extensions are added.
</p>
<p>
Looking back, using 'gdbm' for the example was propably not the best choice. Berkely DB seems to be much more widely used. As far as I remember, Bio::Index::Fasta is based on Berkeley DB.
</p>
<p>
A more interesting dynamic PMC would be access to Piddles.
Piddles are the basis data structure of the Perl Data languages, <URL:http://pdl.perl.org>.
But before digging into that, I propably should tidy up the 'Parrot YAML' and rework 'Parrot m4'.

<h2>C-level Linking</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2005-01-16T21:52:47</h3>
<p>Is there any reason the linking and library finding must happen at configuration and compile times?  I wonder if you could punt and write a little bit of C code that hooks into NCI to do the linking and loading at runtime.  Of course, being able to write dynamic PMCs in PIR would be even easier.</p>

<p>
The primary reason is of course that this was the easiest to do. Doing the linking at runtime with NCI is propably possible, but I can't see a real advantage of that. It's nice to be able to
do a simple </p><blockquote><div> <tt>ldd gdbmhash.so</tt> </div></blockquote> in  order to see that things are well.

<p>
The most important issue is that distribution to machines without C-compiler is possible. But this is simply a copy of gdbmhash.so to the target machine. When libgdm.so is not available, then gdbmhash.so can't be loaded. Which is a kind of runtime check.
