<p>I've been doing a lot of <a href="http://www.erudil.com/other/books.html">reading </a>lately and came across this in Crawley's translation of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/7142"><i>The History of the Peloponnesian War</i></a> written by Thucydides around 400 BC:
<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
In peace and prosperity, states and individuals have better sentiments, because they do not find themselves suddenly confronted with imperious necessities; but war takes away the easy supply of daily wants, and so proves a rough master, that brings most men's characters to a level with their fortunes.  
<br>
Ã¢â¬Â¦
<br>
Words had to change their ordinary meaning and to take that which was now given them.  Reckless audacity came to be considered the courage of a loyal ally; prudent hesitation, specious cowardice; moderation was held to be a cloak for unmanliness; ability to see all sides of a question, inaptness to act on any. Frantic violence became the attribute of manliness; cautious plotting, a justifiable means of self-defence.  The advocate of extreme measures was always trustworthy; his opponent a man to be suspected. To succeed in a plot was to have a shrewd head, to divine a plot a still shrewder; but to try to provide against having to do either was to break up your party and to be afraid of your adversaries.  
<br>
Ã¢â¬Â¦
<br>
Indeed it is generally the case that men are readier to call rogues clever than simpletons honest, and are as ashamed of being the second as they are proud of being the first.  The cause of all these evils was the lust for power arising from greed and ambition; and from these passions proceeded the violence of parties once engaged in contention.  
<br>
Ã¢â¬Â¦
<br>
Meanwhile the moderate part of the citizens perished between the two, either for not joining in the quarrel, or because envy would not suffer them to escape.
