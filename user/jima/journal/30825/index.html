<div class="span8">
<p><p>Hello. I've been working on a large open source Perl project for a few months now, and I've been wanting a place to post my thoughts and code ideas, just to get them out of my head and onto paper.</p>
<p>The project is growing out of my work on the site An Exquisite Corpse <a href="http://www.anexquisitecorpse.net">http://www.anexquisitecorpse.net</a>, which is a Website devoted to playing the Exquisite Corpse game online (if you don't know what an Exquisite Corpse is, look it up in Wikipedia: <URL:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse>). The current system was cobbled together as quickly as possible, which of course means it's not that great or easy to use. I'm working on the next version of the code and trying to make it a lot more general-purpose (i.e., to provide the capability of implementing other online collaborative art games, not just Exquisite Corpse) and more user-friendly, with the ultimate goal of making it open source and available for other people to use and extend. </p>
<p> The new system, which I am currently referring to as the Collaborative Art Management System, or CAMS, will be a user-management system with a series of Perl modules that implement a series of collaboartive art "games". The first one I'm implementing is Exquisite Corpse, but ultimately I hope to have a number of games written. Other possible games include Photoshop Tennis <a href="http://www.coudal.com/tennis.php>, Corpse Tennis <URL:http://www.deadhorse.org/corpsetennis">http://www.coudal.com/tennis.php>, Corpse Tennis <URL:http://www.deadhorse.org/corpsetennis</a>, and a text version of Exquisite Corpse. </p>
<p> I'm still in the development stage right now, and hope to have some code up and running by sometime next year. (It's not a high priority project; I do have a real job, as well as a fairly active social life.) A tentative goal is to attend either the 2007 or 2008 SXSW Interactive festival <a href="http://www.sxsw.com">http://www.sxsw.com</a> and promote the site, or the new project, or both. From the reports I've been getting about the festival it sounds like a good place to spread the gospel of the Corpse. I've also thought of attending Perl conferences to discuss the project, but right now I think we want to focus more on getting artists interested in the project, to improve the content that we're getting on the site. </p>
<p> So this site will be infrequently updated, as I work on the project and want to share my findings. Catch you later.... </p></p>
