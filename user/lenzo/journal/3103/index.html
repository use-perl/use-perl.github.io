<p>Here we go -- time to start keeping a journal.  <br/><br/>One thing that's been on my mind the is question of how to build a sustainable growth model for the Perl Foundation, with all the issues that creates.   There isn't going to be any one thing that's going to do it; it's a good thing I'm not the only one working on it.  Part of the problem is that there are so many good people in the Perl community, and few can be publicly supported.  That, and there are a thousand and one small projects that need money -- targeted donations seem to be working for these.  <br/><br/>I've heard from some folks in industry "Perl does everything I want it to do, right now.  What's to develop?"  It's true that Perl is incredibly useful as it is, but the Perl 6 development (and other things) is going to need a lot of things in play to get going, such as DBI/DBD support, which is the backbone of many of the large installations.  ...Not to mention how much needs to happen on Perl 6 itself; the substantial changes coming in, and the progress on Parrot, are already revealing that Perl 6 is going to be a very real step forward.  Faster, safer, cheaper (in terms of resource usage), better.  <br/><br/>I think it's difficult to come back each year, kicking off a new funding campaign and asking for individuals to donate once again.  People have been amazingly good and generous, but it can't be presented as "contribute or there will be a disaster."  The benefits have to be clear, and Damian gave us a lot in his first year that shows how useful it can be.  This year, Larry, Damian, and Dan can get a lot done, especially if we raise the whole ambitious amount.    The individual contributions have been fantastic, and so have the corporate donations.  <br/><br/>Oh, and I have to give Randal (merlyn++) points for the fundraising he's been doing, and matching at talks.  <br/><br/>Kevin
