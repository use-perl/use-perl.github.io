<div class="span8">
<p>I was having insane problems trying to CONCAT text during a database UPDATE to a text field.  I want to use the database's (mysql in my case) CONCAT function because the data could be large & only wanted to pass in new lines & not the entire contents of the column.
<p/>
So for a column called output I would CONCAT to it like so:
<p/>
<code>$row->update( { output => \"CONCAT(output, $new_stuff)" } );</code>
<p/>

Which is groovy as long as $new_stuff didn't contain single quotes or question marks.  Single quotes throw off database quoting and question marks throw off DBI...
<p/>
So there's a 'quote' function available via DBI which takes care of the single quotes - usually - but completely ignores question marks.  Look at it in DBI.pm - it's pretty, um, bare-bones.
<p/>
So I would call DBI's quote function & then use an ugly regex to prepend all question mark's that didn't already begin with a backslash with a backslash - and this worked - mostly.
<p/>
There were several problem that would crop up intermittently & of course always at the exact wrong time.  If a single quote was already preceded by a backslash calling DBI's quote made it worse & the update would fail (note DBI's quote function replaces all single quotes with 2 single quotes & then puts single quotes around the entire string.)
<p/>
I also had problem with my regex seemingly not working in all cases to properly hide the question marks from DBI & would get errors occasionally about providing too many or too few parameters for the given number of question marks.
<p/>
Welp after just dealing with the errors that would occasionally pop up I finally got off my butt & came up with a quoting fix that so far as been 100% reliable for any combinations of single quotes, question marks, & backslashes before them.
<p/>
The secret is to totally get rid of those character & replace them with char(39) and char(63) for single quote and question mark respectively.
<p/>
The deal is to delete any backslashes before any single quote or question marks in the output, the replace those character with their 'char' equivalents in-between single quotes and commas (as CONCAT can take multiple values).
<p/>
Here's what it looks like:
<p/>
<code>
sub concat_db {
<br/>
    my($row, $column, $value) = @_;
<br/>
<br/>
    # get rid of an backshlased single quotes<br/>
    $value =~ s/\\'/'/g;<br/>
<br/>
    # clean up single quotes<br/>
    $value =~ s/'/', char(39), '/g;<br/>
<br/>
    # clean up '?'s<br/>
    $value =~ s/\\\?/?/g;<br/>
    $value =~ s/\?/', char(63), '/g;<br/>
<br/>
    # concat it<br/>
    $row->update({ $column => \"CONCAT($column, '$value')" });<br/>
}<br/>
</code>
<p/>

I put this code in my top-level DBIC::Schema class & call it thusly:
<p/>

<code>
MYDB::concat_db($row, 'output', "My wacky \'output\' ??? 'yoyo' ");
</code>
<p/>

& magically the correct quoting happens.
<p/>
Here's what that string looks like after its been quoted:
<p>
'My wacky ', char(39), 'output', char(39), ' ', char(63), '', char(63), '', char(63), ' ', char(39), 'yoyo', char(39), ''
<p/>
Note the first & last single quote get put there in the CONCAT statement itself.
<p/>
Happy Quoting!!
