<p>This afternoon wasn't quite as frantic as this morning's six talks, in one way, since you didn't have to decide where to be as often. I decided to camp in the room with Jos's CPANPLUS talk, which was interesting although I think I paid a little too little attention once again; the fact it has interfaces to many package management systems had passed me by (and Aevil managed to volunteer to build Solaris packages, too, I think). That was nifty. I was fighting various installation problems on OS X during the talk on TERN, which would have gone over my head anyway, I suspect.<br/><br/>The main reason I was camped in that room was for Adam Turoff's talk, advertised as SOAP but really covering XML-RPC and REST too. In the end it was more of a high-level overview but it did help clear up the distinctions between them. I'm not sure a longer talk would strictly be useful. Following that was a talk on getting through authenticating firewalls with Perl's socket programming, which again I paid slightly too little attention to.<br/><br/>Lightning talks followed, with Adam Turoff doing two good talks, on learning from other languages (FORTRAN, Lisp, Smalltalk, C++ and Forth) and why Perl6 is a good thing. There were also talks criticising the community's handling of social issues and search.cpan.org which seemed to go down badly on IRC, but which I thought had a kernel of truth; Allison Randal, a newcomer to the Perl community who's involved in Perl6 design, who did a Dr Seuss style poem on the new language, and other talks on graphing web sites (acme would be proud), using Getopt::Declare, buidling complex websites, SNMP and a few others that seemed to have less impact my memory. Oh, we're just about to get gnat's movie...<br/><br/>Once the lightning talks finish (yes, I'm being very bad and blogging them during the time allocated) there's a set of BOFs; I think I'll go to the CPANPLUS one, continuing my avoidance of pretty much all the Perl6 stuff (sorry, people). There's also a barbecue on later, which I think I've managed to get a lift to.</p>
