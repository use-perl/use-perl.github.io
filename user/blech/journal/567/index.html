<p>This afternoon saw most of the Londoners sitting around the edges of the O'Reilly room, so their laptops were umbilically powered (well, mine is now; I've checked, and it can eke out 2 hours, just, but that's fairly hairy) and they can sit on #london.pm or #$talk and discuss stuff.<br/><br/>The talk itself was pretty nifty- Schwern's an amusing speaker, and he made good use of the slides (<a href="http://magnonel.guild.net/user/schwern/talks/How_To_Be_Lazy/full_slides/slide055.html">which we viewed</a> on our laptops, as all of us seem horrifically short sighted) as a starting point for the talk, rather than the be-all and end-all. We also got an insight into things that had actually happened at $company, which is also a good thing. Well, it's certainly <i>entertaining</i>. In a way it's all obvious, but it's also stuff that it's too easy not to do. Ah well. (I really need to work out how to make my stuff work with this, now.)<br/><br/>(Communists, by the way, is a reference to collective code ownership, and I suffixed it Kings as a literary reference which should be obvious...)<br/><br/>He's overshot his talk time horrifically, but that's OK as it's interesting. London.pm seem to be gearing up already for the pub event tonight (for those of us who aren't speaking, anyway). Hopefully I'll get to see a little more of the city proper. Maybe I should have stayed over until next week like some of the others. Ah well. I don't imagine the city's going anywhere.</p>
