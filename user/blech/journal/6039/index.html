<p>I thought there should be some more context for the last post, which was the edited quotes from the movie <a href="/user/gnat/">gnat</a> shot. That was the context. There do seem to be plans to post it online at some point, and I recommend you watch it.<br/><br/>I spent a good hour in Jos Bouman's CPANPLUS talk. It was quite amusing how some of the issues that started the whole CPANTs drive have been solved already, to some extent, by the project, and how some of the other queries around it were general packaging queries. I'm really looking forward to the 0.4 release, which seems to have a lot of really nifty goodies in it, most notably (for me) the packaging tools, which will hopefully let people who want to use their distribution's packaging tool as much as possible do so happily.<br/><br/>Once hachi had emerged from the Perl6 BOF dha, DrForr and I got our lift to the barbeque |siv| was hosting at his house out in the 'burbs. There didn't seem to be that much Perl talk going on, but I did kick about a 'soccer' ball for a bit (handy hint: this is not good in the humidity and heat of St Louis), listened to gnat and pudge play guitar in the garden, talked to various people about travel experiences, cloverleafs, accents, smoking, reunions and of course beer. (Someone managed to bring some Young's Chocolate Stout and another beer- from the US, I think- I forget the name of which really impressed the locals.)<br/><br/>In any case, it was a good party- the social highlight so far by far- and I seem to be doing well so far in hangover taming...</p>

<h2>Beer for the Locals</h2>

I think one of the beer that really impressed the locals at <tt>|siv|</tt>'s house was Schneider Aventinus, brought to the party courtesy of freeside.
<p>
Aventinus is a wheat (doppel)?bock from Germany, and quite tasy in the summer. &nbsp;:-)  Distintive purple label on a &nbsp;.75l bottle.  Easily one of the world's best beers.[*]  If there was an impressive domestic beer, I don't recall what it might have been.
</p><p>
*: An impressive feat, even if that list doesn't have a known upper bound. &nbsp;:-)</p>
