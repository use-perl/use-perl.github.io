<p>... but first, a report on yesterday night. Beer at the venue is *astoundingly* cheap: it's 2 guilders a bottle, so we stayed in the venue then found a local (Philip from demon.nl, hi!) who led us around the city to a nice little cafe/ restaurant where they knew his name and we had really nice snails, prawns, lamb, chicken, bread and tiny little potatoes. Reports suggest it was nicer (foodwise) than the speakers dinner. Yay!<br/><br/>Thence we found the Wildemaan (muttley takes the credit here- I still don't 'get' the navigation; radial cities are strange, as Norwich proved to me when I moved there five years ago) and the heretics outside the Bon Ton. Nice (cheap, again) beers, before we headed off back to the hotel. It seemed a bit cloudy, but I wasn't prepared for the thunderstorm we had to hack through on the way back to the hotel. Soggy, but on the other hand seeing the entire sky flash was cool.<br/><br/>Talking of sky (grief, I'm worse than a Radio 1 DJ) the first talk I really paid attention to today was his POE tutorial. It was a good recap of how I thought it was working (I was vaguely right, but as I mainly use stuff through a component sitting atop it, I don't need to worry overly about the internals). It prompted me to (once more) see if it works on Mac OS, so I can carry on working on my not terribly super-sekrit IRC bot a bit more.<br/><br/>Meanwhile I sat on IRC with a bunch of people, who seem to be filling people's <a href="http://www.ex-parrot.com/user/chris/driftnet/">driftnet</a> caches with <a href="http://www.library.nwu.edu/govpub/collections/wwii-posters/img/ww1647-16.jpg">American WW2 propaganda posters</a>, and wondering just how orange one man (acme) can be.</p>
