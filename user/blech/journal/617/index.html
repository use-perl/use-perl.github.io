<p>OK, I said no more non-perl content, but I typed this in during the auction, but it got lost, so I'm recreating it from memory, even though binky's covered some of it. I'll go quiet after this. Honest guvnor.<br/><br/>So after the final talk, there was the farewell, with lots of well-deserved applause; my particular thanks go to Jouke for organising the hotel, which was very helpful in getting a lot of the Londoners over, involved, and, um, drunk too. Greg McCarroll started a raffle for t-shirts and cards, with typically British pronunciation of the foreign names (and no, I wouldn't have done any better).  Then came a rather involved explanation of Dutch bidding and Redvers Davies GTK app, and the sale of lots and lots of books.<br/><br/>However, there were several odd items interspersed within the shirts and books. Firstly, Greg himself competed with <a href="~davorg">davorg</a> for the date for the official meeting date: first Thursday of the month, or the day after the first Wednesday of the month (see <a href="http://london.pm.org/about/faq.html">the london.pm</a> FAQ for more). After getting out of their depths, each side attracted a posse of supporters; davorg had the numbers, but Greg had the money, and cunning- promising beer to defectors then pulling an IRC bid out of the air to win the day.<br/><br/>Also auctioned were dedications of modules and japh/obfuscated code, and (naturally) signed pictures of Buffy and Willow. Greg also sang, which drove up profits enormously. Anyway, all good fun, and I'm glad I was there.</p>
