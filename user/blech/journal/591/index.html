<p>After sky's POE talk, I stayed put for mod_perl 2.0, which mainly whizzed past me but the calling perl from php and vice versa sounded, um, interesting, especially from work's point of view, as did the autobuild concept. Might have to have a look.<br/><br/>At lunch the laptop took exception to sudden removal of the wireless card (so I won't do that, then) and POE revealed a burning need for a makefile, so I need to figure out how to pull all the bits together to make that work. I'm sure there are tutorials linked somewhere off macperl.org, so it's probably just Google and grokking. I hope...<br/><br/>This afternoon I've been shuttling between $room[2] and the O'Reilly room for the lightning talks. Upstairs, that meant H.ÃÂ MerijnÃÂ Brand's ebullient espousal of getting involved in p5p (and the use of format statements, which feels like such a throwback these days &lt;smiley/&gt;) and HugoÃÂ vanÃÂ derÃÂ Sanden's look at tainting and regular expressions, which was a little utilitarian as talks go, but useful, and it's nice to see people driving vi well- gives me incentive to get better.<br/><br/>Downstairs, the pick of the lightning talks was probably Jeremy Gurney's anti-security parody (although of course including Acme::Buffy was always going to convert the London posse), while Ingy's Larry Wall and YAML talks were a recap of stuff from Monday (for me) but still good. (His Inline talk, which I passed up because I'd seen a version on Monday, seemed to get a good reaction, from what I saw at the end.) Nicholas Clark made good use of not using a computer, and I think I vaguely got the hang of what the C core does, a bit, for arithmetic. Oh, and Marty did another scary Quantum module, but then I'd previewed that one too. (London.pm is a Good Thing for technical meetings.)<br/><br/>Pub crawl and #perl photo tonight. I might not make an entry tommorow morning quite so early...</p>
