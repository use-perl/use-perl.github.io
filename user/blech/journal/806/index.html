<p>Not much interesting code to report upon (although I did make the front page, at least, of <a href="http://london.pm.org/">london.pm.org</a> XHTML compliant), but there was a technical meeting last night, so here's a quick summary.<br/><br/>After the obligatory announcements, and the squeezing of a quart of london.pm into the pint pot that was <a href="http://www.readingroom.net/">Reading Room's</a> conference room, I gave my talk on 'RSS, Infobots and You', which was a demo of my <a href="http://husk.org/perl/bbcnews.html">bbc news</a> rss convertor as discussed previously here; despite basically wittering off the cuff it seemd to go well. Another few patch ideas came from the audience, and I really should check out that ticker.<br/><br/>Then Michael Stevens and Richard Clamp gave a brief overview of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Pod-Coverage">Pod::Coverage</a>; people seemed to ask a lot of questions, but this was apparently a good thing. Then Michael talked about <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=">Mail::Listdetector</a> and urged us all to test it for him; a nice idea, but being the Mac recidivist I am Eudora Filters work for me.<br/><br/>As the last talk before the break was the epic Wax::On, Wax::Off, surviving (mainly) undaunted from two laptop failures, a lack of dual head displaying, the usual london.pm heckling and muttering and the fact that some of the audience had heard all the jokes before. A sterling effort.<br/><br/>After a break so we didn't all suffocate each other, Simon Cozens turned up to talk about the <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2001/09/18/parrot.html">Parrot virtual machine</a> (which someone- Piers, perhaps- suggested might be better known as the Parrot Virtual Computer, purely for its initials). Leon talked about his work in converting Java bytecode to Parrot bytecode, which is, um, interestingly scary, and then we had a Sekrit Talk that didn't happen. Honest.<br/><br/>After that we, obviously, went down the pub, where Trelane and I discussed various infobot hackery. In a shock move for the group, people seemed to go home on or about pub closing time, but even so, it was a good meeting. Hurrah.</p>
