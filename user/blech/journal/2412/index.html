<p>Well, the time swung round for the first technical meeting during my stint as leader of London.pm. It was a week late (since I left it a bit late confirming a venue; <a href="http://www.codix.net">codix.net</a> hosted their second meeting in a row, which was great). The turnout was a little less than the November meeting, but that was fine as the meeting was a bit crowded last time, and through no fault of the kind volunteer who was meant to be bringing a projector, he couldn't. We ended up using a biggish monitor and hoping.<br/><br/><a href="~richardc">Richard Clamp</a> was the first to speak, talking about his scary hacking with parameters. Then <a href="~davorg">Dave Cross</a> stood in while Mark booted his laptop and gave his <a href="http://www.mag-sol.com/talks/idiotic/">Idiotic Perl</a> talk, which will ring bells for those of you've been keeping up with his journals. <a href="~2shortplanks">Mark Fowler</a> spoke on the building of the 2001 <a href="http://www.twoshortplanks.com/xmas/">Advent Calendar</a>, which seems to have been a triumph over adversity of some magnitude, and also revealed some of the thoughts he has for the one next (uh, this) year.<br/><br/>After the break, Nick Clark talked about his work in long numbers for Perl 5.8; it all looked nice and scary. Finally <a href="~acme">Leon Brocard</a> plugged <a href="http://www.parrotcode.org/">Parrot</a> a bit more; it was a good update on what's in there (yay, Perlish PMCs!) and it seems to have encouraged a few more installs, and critiques on documentation, which is all to the good.<br/><br/>Anyway, it seemed to go fairly well, which was a nice surprise, and there's only five more to go before I hand over the reins later toward the end of the year. If only I could delegate this all to someone...</p>
