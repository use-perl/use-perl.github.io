<p>Having wireless networking at a conference <i>rocks</i>. It's a shame how badly it depletes battery life, though. (On a train I usually squeeze two or two and a half hours out of a battery. This morning, I think it was looking more like an hour and a half. Might have to do the richardc solution and run two. Media Bays also rock.)<br/><br/>It's nice that all our mobile phones (mainly) are working, too. Most of us even got welcome SMSes from the local operators, too. They must really want us to use their information services. (Those of us on the vaguely branded trip to NY really missed them.)<br/><br/>Kevin's opening talk was rapid but useful; the bags of goodies are pretty, well, good; Abigail's talk made my head hurt, but was good while I could cope, and now it's lunch, and I'm draining juice (muttley gets bonus karma for bringing the UK four plug strip, so we don't have to lug about power adapters). Mind you, given the laptop he's using, he should be able to haul boulders by the time the conference is over.<br/><br/>This afternoon? Well, being lazy sounds good. (And yes, that is a talk, not just sitting in the cafe area. Insert smileys as required.)</p>
