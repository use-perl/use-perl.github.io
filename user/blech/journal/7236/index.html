<div class="span8">
<p>Way back in July, there was a fairly big <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Matts/journal/6274" index="Matts's journal post">thread</a> ensued on use.perl about people leaving, and keeping track of their journals. In the wake of that I knocked up <a href="http://husk.org/perl/friends.html">a bit of code</a> that visits a site, reads the RDF feed, and generates a listing a lot like the use.perl friends page. (Note that RSS 0.91 feeds are a bit useless, as they don't have time metadata. More on that later.)<br/><br/>I've been prompted to revisit it because <a href="http://london.pm.org/">London.pm</a> is looking at how (and whether) to revamp the site, and it struck <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme/journal/">acme</a> that maybe collating people's use.perl.org journals would be a good idea. It turns out that plugging the <a href="http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?content_type=rss&op=rss&uid=1597">RSS feed</a> of this journal into the CGI works fine, except it doesn't have a timestamp on the entry. (Pudge? Please? :) In any case, hey presto, instant community content!<br/><br/>In a similar vein, I've seen an interesting collection of blogs on <a href="http://haddock.org/blogs/">haddock.org</a>, which instead of presenting snapshots of entries like my code does, provides a chronology of updates. This is also pretty nifty.</p>

<h2>Feedage</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hex/">hex</a> on 2002-08-25T23:40:25</h3>
Coo. I didn't know that this site did RSS as well. Another thing for me to code up for the front page of $my_site.



<h2>body text</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jerakeen/">jerakeen</a> on 2002-08-25T23:52:40</h3>
Ok, is there any way of getting a feed with full body text in it? I'd like to read important journals in my feed browser, but all this feed provides is the first few words of the body...
<p>Or am I totally misunderstanding the purpose of rss?</p>

I'm not 100% on this, but it looks like they're cramming the start of articles into the &lt;summary&gt;, which smells like a bit of a hack to me. Then again, what do I expect, AI summarisation?



<h2>Re:body text</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/blech/">blech</a> on 2002-08-26T10:43:52</h3>
Possibly, but if you are, you're not the only one.<br> <br>There seem to be a wide range of RSS 1.0 feeds out there. For example, Matt Webb's Interconnected RSS feed has the full text of entries, whereas a default MT feed has only titles and an 'entry excerpt' (which is usually not manually written, and thus turns out to be the first few lines of the entry). I'm sure there are some people who just send journal entry titles, but I can't think of an example right now.<br> <br>However, given RSS (possibly) has one of the Ses as short for 'summary', I think expecting full text is probably overly hopeful.

Then how can all these magic agregator things <i>work</i>, then? The whole point, to me, is being able to use one app to see all the new posts on all my friend's journals, and read them, without having to actually open a web browser for every article.
