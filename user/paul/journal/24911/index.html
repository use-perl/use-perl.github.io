<p>I downloaded and installed slashcode a couple weeks ago.  The install was long, but fairly straightforward and I'm pretty impressed with the software.  It seems pretty powerful, though a bit hard to configure.  
<p>
I couldn't find any good documentation on the web and the local BN didn't have the slashcode book.  I figure  I'll just post my experiences here as I poke around and maybe someone will have some good advice.  I'm sure there are plenty of slashcode experts lurking about.
<p>
One thing I'm trying to figure out is how to change which blocks display on the right side of the main index page.  Maybe it's obvious, but I'm not seeing it...
<p>
Anyway, check out my site at

<p>I've been playing with setting up a Slash installation on-and-off for a while now.</p>

<p>Have you discovered slashguide.shtml in the root of your site?  On the subject of blocks, it says that the 'Ordernum' field on a block definition controls whether it appears and in which order, for people who aren't logged in.  Values of -1 and 0 have special significance.</p>

<p>Once people have set up a login they can chose which blocks they want to see using the 'Homepage' link under user 'Preferences'.  You control which options they see using 'Blocks' on the Admin menu.</p>

Thanks.  Yeah, I have been editing the blocks.  It was confusing, because I'd edit a block and the old content would show up randomly with the new.  Looks  like server-side caching somewhere, but it's not consistent.
