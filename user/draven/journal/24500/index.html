<p><h3>Hey kids.</h3>

<p>Sorry about the lack of updates this weekend, but really, it's been sorta quiet, and I've spent most of my time either outdoors or painting my office, so time has been scarce.</p>
<p>I did manage to squeeze in time for a interview with <a href="http://perlcast.com/">Perlcast</a> tho. It was included in <a href="http://perlcast.com/2005/05/01/perlcast-7/">Perlcast #7</a>. Go check it out for a good laught at my expence. :)</p>
<p>There's also been some CPAN activity. On saturday we pushed some needed fixes for existing modules. The <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/mramberg/Catalyst-Model-CDBI-0.08/">CDBI model</a> was updated to require the latest CDBI-Loader, to let the user see any error messages on initialization, which had been supressed before. The <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/mramberg/Catalyst-Plugin-Browser-0.02/">Browser</a> & <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/mramberg/Catalyst-Plugin-Unicode-0.2/">Unicode</a> plugins also needed some bug fixes, one my fault, the other chansen's :). Finally, we released a updated <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/mramberg/Catalyst-Model-CDBI-Sweet-0.02/">Catalyst::Model::CDBI::Sweet</a>, in preparation for moving the core to a stand alone Class::DBI module.</p>
<p>I also found time on Sunday to package up and release Chansen's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/mramberg/Catalyst-Plugin-Geography-0.01/">Geography plugin</a>. It's pretty sweet, lets you get country/code from the user's ip.</p>
Omega finally found some time to put his <a href="http://svn.palle.net/svn/repos/omega/easycms/trunk/EasyCMS/">EasyCMS repo</a> online. This is another nice Catalyst example. He's got a demo online <a href="http://easycms.palle.net">here</a>, but no public login so far. I've gotten a peek tho, and have to say I'm impressed, just need a designer's touch, and the html looks quite sane, so that should be piece of cake. Gabb, are you up for the challenge? :)</p>
<p>Some more views are coming today, you can check the repo if you are curious. They are all packaged up, just need to be pushed out.</p>
<p>Last night, when they should be in their beds, Sri and Chansen had a long discussion about reusable application components. There's a reusable article something coming up, once we finish the discussion on how to name everything :)</p></p>
