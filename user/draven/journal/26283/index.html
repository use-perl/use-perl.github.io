<p>What where you thinking in posting that here? Here is what I was thinking while reading it <em>"So now there is one less annoying person doing CGI::App"</em>. Good.</p>

That wasn't very polite!<br><br>I don't *dislike* CGI::App at all! I got pretty good at it, in fact, and enjoyed it for what it did. But there were certain things that I wanted to do, which I ended up having to hack in myself; run-modes simply didn't cover the extent of my requirements. This is not a slight against CGI::App, but more Catalyst fills my needs better for what I want to do -- and some of that *is* annoying, at least to me (a certified unprogrammer).<br><br>But yes, obviously I am an annoying and stupid person, and my usage or non-usage of a piece of software affects you in some unspecified but very intimate way. Possibly involving bananas and scented candles.<br><br>I can only assume that draven posted it here because, well, it can't rain *all* the time.

I think the objection was to the general tone of your IRC comment.  Saying that CGI::App is annoying and that things built with are toys is a pretty inflammatory statement.  You have to expect you will offend some people when you say things like that.

You could certainly take it that way, if you were a zealot.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br/><br/>Look at it from a self-deprecating standpoint, wherein I am only capable of writing toys. If you spend any time in #catalyst (or #perl when I was in there) it would become immediately obvious I tend towards the facetious and have a healthy respect for the powers of self-deprecation. Of course, if you spent any time on IRC, you would probably understand that IRC quotes are almost always taken out of context (though in this case I think the only context is knowing anything about me as a "developer").<br/><br/>And the things I was trying to do *were* annoying -- so it's either a statement of fact that those things were a pain to do in CGI::App (but are easier to do within the larger framework of Catalyst), or that I am simply not very skilled.<br/><br/>As I've admitted to the latter, well.<br/><br/>At any rate: Dongs for all and a hearty EOF.

I'm sorry, didn't realize it could be parsed as "all CGI::App based apps are toys", rather than "I made toys in cgi::app",
