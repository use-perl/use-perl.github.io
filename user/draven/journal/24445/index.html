<p>After the flood of modules yesterday, we had to take a breather to write some more, so pretty much no news on CPAN today. Actually, that's not quite true. I didn't mention yesterday's release of Christian's <b>sweet</b> Class::DBI model, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/sri/Catalyst-Model-CDBI-Sweet-0.01/">Catalyst::Model::CDBI::Sweet</a>.  This adds some pretty nice features to the standard Catalyst models, like transparent abstract search, pluggable Cache support and UUID generation.</p>
<p>Christian hasn't been resting tho, and he's got a Geography plugin and a HTML::Tidy view coming soon, more about that when we've got them to CPAN. There's also some work afoot to make smaller legos for auth and autz, rumors of SMTP auth and other interesting things are rampant as well.</p>
<pre>
16:23 <@chansen> $c->geography->country
16:23 <@chansen> $c->geography->code
16:23 <@chansen> without arguments they return the current users country or code16:24 < chisel> sounds cool
16:24 <@chansen> can also be called $c->geography->country('SE')
16:25 <@chansen> sri: Stop thinking about verbosity!
16:25 <@chansen> sri: there is an alias for ya, $c->geo ;)
</pre>
<p>Sri feels badly about the <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/d/Module-Pluggable-Fast">reviews</a> for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/sri/Module-Pluggable-Fast-0.15/">Module::Pluggable::Fast</a>. Personally I don't care, but I think the comments are stupid. If you don't get it, don't use it, but don't come bitching about it. M-P-F is essential for the way Catalyst & Class::DBI::Loader initializes it's classes.</p>
<p>AndyG is doing a shopping cart for his wife using Catalyst, as well as a presentatation of his ServerDB example for work and promises to release once they are done. We've also had a request for a interview from the <a href="http://www.joshmcadams.com/perlcast/">Perlcast</a> pod cast. I hadn't heard about them before, but it's quite good stuff, and getting better, so definitively worth a look. They even mentioned us in last week's issue :)</p>
<p>Ah, I did forget one important new Catalyst release yesterday. <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme">Acme</a> released 0.42 of his <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/lbrocard/Devel-ebug-0.42/">Devel::ebug</a> module, with the sweet Ajax Catalyst frontend. Definitively worth checking out as well!</p>
<p>On the design front, gabb is almost done htmlifying the Catalyst web design. One of the Ngmedia designers are helping as well, doing a proper vector version of the catalyst logo, and he's promised to deliver some original artwork for the web site as well. We haven't seen any of it yet, so we're quite excited.</p>
