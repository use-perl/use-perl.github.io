<p><p>Hey, and welcome to the first Catalyst summary. I'll try to keep this daily, if I can find the time required to read all the idle chatter on #catalyst, and pick out the gems for you guys.</p>

Anyways, let's go through todays events.
<ul>
<li>Puck is going to write a Class::DBI transaction plugin for CDBI. At least he promises to do it.</li>
<li>Work starts on CForum, which is meant to be a simple showcase application for the Catalyst Framework. Also, hopefully it will be a worthy alternative to all the crappy PHP forums out there. It will not have a feature focus tho, just the basics.</li>
<li>SRI is on the drugs again, so expect good things.</li>
<li>SRI finishes the first version of HTML::Prototype and launches it as a replacement for HTML::Ajax. It's an implementation of the
 ajax library Rails uses, thus the name. Still, a lot of discussion on irc and on the mailing list about the name, which most people find non-descript, SRI can't be moved on this issue tho.</li>
<li>A major bug in $c->forward is fixed, and tests are added to make sure it doesn't rear it's ugly head again.
<li>New Policy for comitters: Any commits without a good log message will result in 10 lashings with SRIs tounge. Also:<br>
Every message should be prefixed with Added/Fixed/Changed/Improved/...:</li>
<li> - A new "examples" dir is added to the repository, containing MiniMojo and the newly started CForum app.</li>
<li>Christian writes a new module soon to reach CPAN which extends search and adds SQL::Abstract in a backwards compatible fashion. It also handles deflation of objects so you can use them as search arguments if they are defined with has_as. This new plugin will also have count functionality with the same features.
<li>SRI preaches SVK on IRC, and everybody agrees it is sweet.</li>
<li>Ask, if you are reading this, we still want our domain :( . Seems we can't get any of the Catalyst top domains either.</li>
