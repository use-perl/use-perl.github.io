<ul>
<li>Ooops. discovered some missing files in the 5.01 release. Time to add some manifest tests. Released 5.02 with the missing files.
<li>Some of us start collaborating on a Catalyst article. A lot of discussion on what the example should be. Some folks find wikis boring. I'm not among them, and neither is Sri, who makes the Final Decision this time.
<li>A minor naming mistake in the fillinform plugin's test is corrected.</li>
<li>Fordmason complains about all the poorly documented modules, then proceeds to do something about it by writing Catalyst::Manual::Plugins</li>.
<li>Started a new example 'Clobe' - Catalyst planet clone.</li>

16:28 <gabb> Imagine a board meeting and suddenly those three guys crash the party on their two-wheel scooters like the apocalyptic riders.

16:29 <autrijus> actually they've upgraded.

16:29 <autrijus> far more apocalyptic
16:30 <gabb> Wow ... I couldn't imagine this becoming any more geeky or scary - they proved me wrong.

<i>Some of us start collaborating on a Catalyst article. A lot of discussion on what the example should be.</i>
<br> <br>
There is a reason everyone does the "Hello World" thing. It makes it very easy to compare amongst languages.
<br> <br>
More importantly, it is something the reader may already know how to do in some other language. This makes evaluating the technology against what the reader already knows much easier.
<br> <br>
With that said, may I suggest the ever so typical and boring database application?<br/><br/><ul> <li>Add entries</li>
<li>Edit entries</li>
<li>Remove entries</li>
<li>List entries</li>
</ul><br/><br/>That's what I'd like to see.
<br> <br>
FWIW I'm looking from a Mason and Maypole point of view.

<p>I'm not sure it does make comparing decent technologies easier.  Sure, "Hello, World!" in J2EE fares particularly badly, but J2EE supposedly has lots of advantages for more complicated tasks.</p>

<p>If it's a completely new language, it's probably the right way to start, but if you want to show off a platform or framework to people who will compare it to others, choose an example that shows off your strengths.</p>

Hey,

This add/edit/remove/list is done by simple CRUD plugin for Catalyst. You can view an example of its usage in

<a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/sri/Catalyst-5.02/lib/Catalyst/Manual/Cookbook.pod#Scaffolding" title="cpan.org">http://search.cpan.org/user/sri/Catalyst-5.02/lib/Catalyst/Manual/Cookbook.pod#Scaf<nobr>f<wbr></nobr>  olding</a cpan.org>
<p>
And also check out Catalyst::Manual::Intro and Cookbook, they both get you started well.</p>
