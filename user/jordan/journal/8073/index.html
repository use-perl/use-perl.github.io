<div class="span8">
<p><blockquote>In other words, any prophecy from God is guaranteed to be accurate, and any prophecy which is not from God but given in his name shall guarantee the death of the prophet. I am risking my life to tell you this.</blockquote>
<p>I have the slashbox (useperlbox?) active for Random Alex Chiu quotes and it's coming up with the above right now.
<p>This one is incredible!  So, is he telling a prophecy which is not from God above or what?  Is this one of those circular paradoxes?  If this is a prophecy from God, then it's the truth and Alex has nothing to fear, even though he says he does, or it's not a prophecy from God, in which case he fears for his life, but wait, then the statement he's making is not trustworthy.  But wait, if he tells a prophecy not from God, his death is certain, so fearing for your life would seem silly.  Is Alex hinting at some secret society that doesn't want this truth about prophecies to get out?  
<p>And besides, why would Alex Chiu ever fear for his life?  He has the Patented Eternal Life Device &trade; and, just to be sure, believes in the inevitabililty of resurrection.</p>

It's best not to think too hard on what that boy says.  He's just not right in the head.
