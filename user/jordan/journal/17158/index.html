<p>Looks like we'll be using Java for a serious project at work.  I've dabbled in Java in the past, but I was always kind of scared away by the huge intellectual footprint.  It just seems like so much infrastructure for so little advantage.
<p>Be that as it may, it's probably time now to swallow these objections and get into it in a serious way.
<p>The resources and advice out on the web there are daunting and confusing.  Here, there are people that I trust, at least none of you will try and sell me a Java book or course.  Some of you have done significant Java, I would imagine.
<p>What do you folks recommend would be a good course to really get into Java?  What are the good books?  What about the books available on <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com>Safari</a>?</p>

<h2>Two Good Books</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2004-02-03T00:02:29</h3>
<p>Bruce Eckel's <a href="http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIJ/" title="mindview.net">Thinking in Java</a mindview.net> is quite handy.  You also might appreciate <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/hfjava/" title="oreilly.com">Head First Java</a oreilly.com>.  (Though the style puts off a lot of people initially, it works really well.  I was prepared to hate it.)</p>



<h2>a few resources</h2>

<p>I second chromatic's recommendation of Thinking in Java -- it's a little wordy but pretty clear. O'Reilly's Java Cookbook[1] is very good, as is their Java in a Nutshell[2], and Joshua Bloch's Effective Java[3] is a must once you've got some code under your belt. Fowler's Refactoring[4] is also fantastic.

</p><p>Sun actually has quite a few tutorials on their site [5] that aren't bad.

</p><p>There are a ton (some say too many) of opensource projects under the Jakarta [6] umbrella. If you're the sort of person who learns by reading other code it's not a bad place to start, particularly some of the simpler projects like commons-lang and commons-collections. You'll wind up getting frustrated because some functionality that takes 10 or 20 lines in Java will in Perl will be one or two.

</p><p>If you're doing server-side application development I'd recommend spending some time with the Spring framework. [7] It's well-documented, well-designed and strives for simplicity, which is a big difference from many overdesigned Java projects.

</p><p>Finally, in terms of development environments take a look at IntelliJ IDEA.[8] It's the IDE that got me away from xemacs for Java -- don't think bloated editors like JBuilder, think supersmart and productive. I seriously wish I had this for Perl. Some folks like Eclipse[9] as much as I like IDEA, but IDEA is more polished and  straightforward as Eclipse makes you buy into its worldview to get anything done.
