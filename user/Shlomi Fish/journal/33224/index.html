As 
<a href="http://news.perl-foundation.org/2007/05/xmlrss_cleanup_grant_completed.html">I 
wrote on the TPF blog</a>, the XML::RSS grant was officially completed. Most
of what we set to achieve in the scope of the grant has been achieved -
the upcoming XML::RSS 1.30 has close to full test coverage, a much more
modular codebase, and much fewer bugs. The grant being successful and all,
I'm going to receive the money as a cheque in the mail.
</p>

<p>
A few people whom I talked with about the grant congratulated me for it,
or expressed some interest in it in its technicalities.
</p>

<p>
So what's next? Ask told me that he'd like to see a unified interface for
all versions supported by XML::RSS. However, that would mean having some
keys that affect all of them, and possibly an option to trigger this
unified API on and off. Plus, this exact functionality is provided by 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Feed/">XML-Feed</a>.
While XML-Feed also does other things like fetching feeds or handling
Atom feeds, which it is possible that should be abstracted out, I would still
rather not duplicate its functionality. So I think that when I'm in the
mood, I'll contribute to XML-Feed.
