Despite all the problems I had with my old Linux hard-disk (see 
<a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/16075.html">this entry</a>,
<a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/16227.html">this entry</a>
and <a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/16586.html">this entry</a>)
I was able to get some hacking done. Among else, I was able to work a bit on
Test::Run, which is my improved fork of Test::Harness.
</p>

<p>
At first I found out that Ovid added some methods to the interface of 
the TAPx::Parser iterator. So I dumped Test::Run::Iterator (essentially the 
same as Test::Harness::Iterator) and used the internal TAPx::Parser iterator
instead. This worked fine, but after raising this issue in the perl-qa mailing
list, 
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl-qa%40perl.org/msg06929.html">Ovid
    suggested a better way</a>, and so I converted to it.
</p>

<p>
Making use of TAPx::Parser allowed me to remove Test::Run::Iterator
and Test::Run::Point, which were no longer needed. Afterwards, I spent a lot
of time refactoring Test::Run::Straps and to a lesser extent Test::Run
itself. I converted string errors, to classes. Added some missing functionality
that I removed by mistake, and changed the 
<tt>$self-&gt;mymethod(%args)</tt> calling convention to the
<tt>$self-&gt;mymethod({%args})</tt> calling convention, which is more
recommended (by "Perl Best Practices") and other sources.
</p>

<p>
I also refactored the code of some of the tests. One of them
(<tt>t/output.t</tt>) had a lot of duplicate code, which I abstracted in
a convenient function.
</p>

<p>
Now I got a bit tired of endless refactoring and am instead considering 
extracting all the STDOUT/STDERR output specific functionality into
separate plugins. That and possibly relying on the TAPx::Parser statistics
collection functionality for keeping track of some of the statistics. 
(Assuming it is in fact doable).
</p>

<p>
I can't promise I'll work on it because the Israeli Welcome-to-Linux series
is going to take place soon, and I'm one of the organisers. There's also
the website of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamakor">Hamakor, the
    Israeli FOSS NPO</a> which I'd like to revamp. In fact, I've been 
procrastinating working on it by working on Test::Run instead.
