Back when I was looking for a way to aggregate several RSS feeds, a
few years back, I found
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-RSS-Aggregate/">XML-RSS-Aggregate</a>
by Audrey Tang. Using it turned out to be problematic and I had to patch
it, sub-class it, and write a lot of code above it to have it behave with
my feeds.
</p>

<p>
Then after I asked Audrey about it on the IRC, she told me that 
XML-RSS-Aggregate was no longer recommended and that 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Feed/">XML-Feed</a> was then
the way to go. So I happily switched to using XML-Feed and even packaged
it for Mandriva, and all was all. I wrote a 5 star review for it on CPAN
ratings, and wrote a 1 star review on XML-RSS-Aggregate directing people
to XML-Feed instead.
</p>

<p>
My problems started again, when after setting up the feed for my
<a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/modules/XML-Grammar-Fortune/">XML-Grammar-Fortune</a>-based 
fortunes, I discovered that the Atom feed did not validate and the RSS feed
had many warnings. I ended up maintaining XML-Feed in my own repository,
and tried to <a 
href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.module-authors/2008/08/msg6778.html">contact 
the author of XML-Feed</a> about becoming a co-maintainer.
</p>

<p>
Now, yesterday, I joined #plagger on Freenode, trying to see how I can
make progress there, and miyagawa told me about <a 
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Data-Feed/">Data-Feed</a>, which is 
a new module, which aims to be even better than XML-Feed. I thought to myself
"Thanks God!" and decided to try to install it.
</p>

<p>
Not wanting to pollute my system, I decided to prepare 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/packages/Mandriva/Cooker/SRPMS/?C=M;O=D">Mandriva RPMs</a> of it and its dependencies, which you can find
in the link. I ran into a problem with its tests failing due to the fact
what Data-Feed tried doing only worked with XML-RSS-LibXML and not with
XML-RSS which was all I had installed. I 
<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=38173">reported 
a bug</a> about it, and am hoping for the best.
</p>

<p>
Today, I decided to try to convert the XML-Grammar-Fortune-Synd code to
use Data-Feed instead of XML-Feed and see if it would help me. But then
I tried to look up some classes with which I was familiar from XML-RSS
and realised that <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Data-Feed/">Data-Feed 
had practically non-existent documentation</a>. So I could not look up
that information even if I wanted to. 
</p>

<p>
So I decided to stick with XML-Feed for the time being. Right now 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Grammar-Fortune-Synd/">XML-Grammar-Fortune-Synd</a>
depends on XML-Feed with my downstream patches, and fails all tests, and the 
Atom feed still does not validate. So it's only mostly broken.
</p>
