I've gotten somewhat excited lately, and had lots of great ideas for essays,
articles, etc. As a result, most of what I could get myself to write was
text rather than code, and the code I wrote was relatively small shell or Perl
code for my own use. However, a few days ago, I decided to return
to <a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/modules/Test-Run/">Test-Run</a>, and
hack on it a bit.
</p>

<p>
At first I wrote
<a href="http://www.hexten.net/pipermail/tapx-dev/2007-April/000337.html">an
email message</a> that made the case for converting the core Test::Run module
from the GPL+Artistic licence to the MIT X11 licence. Now, since the
GPL+Artistic combo is recursive, this involves a gradual rewrite. I started
working on doing that for Test::Run::Plugin::CmdLine::Output, which I
since have completely rewritten. In the course of this, I was able to
heavily refactor and improve the quality of the code, which was a nice
by-product of the rewrite.
</p>

<p>
In the middle, I got a bit tired of doing that, and instead went on to refactor
and extend the functionality of the command line modules. I added a 
more generalised and re-usable environment variables handling for handling
reading data structures from YAML files, or for specifying a hash mapping 
in LS_COLORS style. 
</p>

<p>
As it turns out, I eventually found a use for 
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Shlomi+Fish/journal/31704">Text-Sprintf-Named</a>
in Test:Run, although not in the original context, but rather to allow
some refactoring of the <tt>::Output</tt> plugin. Since I wanted to call
some methods on an object reference, instead of accessing the variables 
themselves, I had to release a new version of the module (version 0.02).
</p>

<p>
The Berlios.de Subversion server is down at the moment, so if you want
to try it for yourself, you'll have to download
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/code/perl/Test/Test-Run/Test-Run-trunk-2007-04-22.tar.bz2">the temporary snapshot of my working copy</a>.
</p>

<p>
Writing code again feels really good.
