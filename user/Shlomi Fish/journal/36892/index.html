This entry will be a technical entry, but on a relatively lighter side:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitaire">Solitaire games</a>. Solitaire
games (also known as "patience" games) are any of several kinds of
single-player games played using one or more decks of cards. Despite common
belief, the Windows-game called "Solitaire" is actually 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_(solitaire)">Klondike</a>,
which is only one variant of Solitaire. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCell">Freecell</a> is another famous variant of Solitaire.
</p>

<p>
So anyway, I spent some of the past two weeks working on <a 
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Games-Solitaire-Verify/">Games-Solitaire-Verify</a>, which is a CPAN module to <b>verify</b> automated solutions of
solitaire games. So far only Freecell is supported, but there's a lot of
modularity in place for other variants. The intention of this module is
to be used as part of the automated test suite of <a 
href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a>, which is a solver
for several variants of Solitaire, which lacks a comprehensive test suite.
</p>

<p>
I should note that I implemented the very first version of Freecell Solver 
in Perl, but it was horribly slow. Of course, I did some very illogical things 
speed-wise, like <b>(1)</b> putting all the states into an unsorted array and
using linear search to scan it - and <b>(2)</b> constantly deserialising
states into objects and data strcutures of individual cards, columns, and
boards, and doing the comparison the hard way. So it was dog slow. I ended
up re-implementing it as (saner) C code which turned out to be considerably 
faster than the Perl version. Moreover, my next C version was faster by
a factor of about 100 (not because I was smarter, but I was less dumb), and
since then I incorporated many other speed optimisations. (There are also
several C and Assembly-hosted solvers that are much faster than mine.)
</p>

<p>
In any case, someone contacted me about the solver on Facebook, and after
talking to him on Yahoo Messenger, we decided that he, I and another guy
will talk on Freenode on the newly started #solitaire. There, I was quickly
quickly joined by <a href="http://home.pacbell.net/rklement/">tybalt89</a>,
who is a master golfer, and who decided to write <a 
href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/tybalt-klondike-solver/">his own solver
for Klondike in Perl</a>. After a while he finished it and so
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/tybalt-klondike-solver/tybalt-klondike-solver.pl">I 
took a look at the source code</a>.
</p>

<p>
From my impression it seems like the kind of code a golfer would write: 
strings instead of objects (with regular expressions and other text processing
to manipulate them), a call to shuffle() from List::Util with a random seed,
no use warnings, lots of obscure two-letter variable names, 
a lot of trailing "or" clauses, and it also has <tt>$hearts</tt>, 
<tt>$clubs</tt>, etc. instead of a hash. I talked about it with another 
master golfer and he said that "golfing rots the brain", and he said
a program he gave as a solution to someone's problem had many golfish 
paradigms as well.
</p>

<p>
tybalt89 reported that his program is relatively fast, but still fails
on many deals. 
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, I finished writing <a 
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Games-Solitaire-Verify/">Games-Solitaire-Verify</a> and released it on the CPAN. Then I decided to test if it
could detect than invalid solution was indeed invalid. And it turned out 
an invalid solution was still reported as valid (!) making the reported 
verdict useless. What I found out was that the complete
solution analysis silently stopped after the first move or two. 
</p>

<p>
I fixed the bug and released a better version (with more tests). Then I 
decided to extract a few more classes 
(<tt>Games::Solitaire::Verify::Freecells</tt> and
<tt>Games::Solitaire::Verify::Foundations</tt>) out of the 
relatively monolithic <tt>::State</tt> class (which represents positions
of the board, including those at midplay), and uploaded version 0.02.
</p>

<p>
I still need to adapt the module to verify solutions of other variants
except Freecell, and that's what I'm planning to work on next. But it was
good enough to add some system tests to Freecell Solver (using Perl, Test::More
and TAP). What I hope is that tests such as this will allow me to revamp
, refactor and enhance Freecell Solver with more confidence that I didn't 
break anything. I'm especially looking forward to the conversion from 
GNU Autoconf to <a href="http://www.cmake.org/HTML/index.html">CMake</a>,
which depends on the test suite to make sure it doesn't break anything.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I also found out that my C-based Freecell Solver program, did not
always output things the right way, without trailing whitespace, etc.
Since my primary motivation with Games-Solitaire-Verify was to verify the
solutions of Freecell Solver, and because I wanted to compare to
the precise output, I needed to emulate these mis-behaviours in my Perl
code as well. I don't like it very much, but I guess I'd rather emulate
Freecell Solver to test it, than fix it and risk breaking something.
Nevertheless, my intention is to provide flags for a saner output for
both the C and Perl programs in the future.
</p>

<p>
Happy Solitaire!
