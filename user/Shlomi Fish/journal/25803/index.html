Yesterday I uploaded the first public release of 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Acme-Gosub/">Acme::Gosub</a> to CPAN. 
This allows you to emulate BASIC's "GOSUB" and "RETURN" statements in Perl. It
all started a long time ago when I thought that Perl's "goto EXPR" statement
was powerful enough to emulate goto, by keeping a stack of labels, and where
RETURN would be something like <tt>goto pop(@labels)</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Then I came to the idea of writing a module to do it. I searched CPAN for
gosub but couldn't find anything relevant so the coast was clear. However,
I then got stucked up in a technicality. A few days ago, I was able to find 
a way to resolve it, and so set down to write the module.
</p>
<p>
I started from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Switch/">Switch.pm</a>
which I knew utilized a code filter. My needs were simpler except for trying to
have a "gosub EXPR;" as a statement, for which I tricked Text::Balanced into
doing it by prepending a leading semicolon and then asking to find a match
code-block that was delimited by semi-colons. (it's a kludge, but it works).
</p>
<p>
I finished it in one afternoon, and then uploaded it. It has a nice test-suite
with some funky functions that make use of gosub. At the moment, it has some
glaring bugs and limitations, but hopefully they will be resolved in a future
work.
</p>
<p>
So now I give you the Acme::Gosub JAPH:
</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

use Acme::Gosub;

my @japh = ("Just another", " Perl", " and Acme::Gosub", " Hacker\n");

sub print_japh
{
    my $print_me;
    $print_me = $japh[0];
    gosub PRINT;
    $print_me = $japh[1];
    gosub PRINT;
    $print_me = $japh[2];
    gosub PRINT;
    $print_me = $japh[3];
    gosub PRINT;
    return;
    PRINT:
    print $print_me;
    greturn;
}
print_japh();
</pre>

</p>
