It all started when I attended a presentation about 
<a href="http://testoob.sourceforge.net/">TestOOB</a> in the first new
<a href="http://www.python.org.il/">Israeli Pythoneers</a> meeting. One thing
that was mentioned there was that it enabled colouring the output of the
tests.
</p>
<p>
Then I decided I wanted the same, only for the final line of the tests in
the "make test" or "./Build test" output. So I looked at Test::Harness, but
then saw that the line printing the OK was buried deep inside the conditional
of a certain function, without an ability to easily override it. Not to
mention that the entire module was not object oriented, so over-riding
functions there was kind of a black magic.
</p>
<p>
I posted 
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl-qa%40perl.org/msg04489.html">a
message to perl-qa</a> asking if someone knew of a good way to do it. Then 
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl-qa%40perl.org/msg04611.html">I
noted</a> that I'd like to spin Test::Harness off and create a better module
while possibly breaking the semantics a lot of the internals. 
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl-qa%40perl.org/msg04620.html">The 
reply of Andy Lester</a> (the Test::Harness maintainer) was "Show me the 
Code".
</p>
<p>
It took me some time, but I finally came to it. I renamed Test::Harness into
Test::Shlomif::Harness and started heavily refactoring and revamping 
it: converting it to an object, extracting methods, converting hashes into
objects, moving function parameters to instance variables, and generally giving
it some <b>loove</b>. My first 
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl-qa%40perl.org/msg04777.html">I 
announced my first release</a> to perl-qa as well. Michael Schwern 
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl-qa%40perl.org/msg04778.html">wrote a 
message with some errata</a>, which I incorporated. 
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl-qa%40perl.org/msg04779.html">Andy 
also had something to say</a>, and this started an active discussion.
</p>
<p>
Since then I did more refactorings and stuff. Today, I released
<a href="http://download.berlios.de/web-cpan/Test-Shlomif-Harness-0.0100_04.tar.gz">version
0.0100_04 onto a non-suspecting world</a>. (especially for this announcement).
The code is maintained in a Subversion repository as part of the 
<a href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/web-cpan/">web-cpan project
on Berlios</a>, so the most up-to-date version is available there.
</p>
<p>
Test::Shlomif::Harness is only a temporary name, but I hope to release it
into CPAN soon. Ironically, I did not yet implement a derived class that does
the colour highlighting of the output.
