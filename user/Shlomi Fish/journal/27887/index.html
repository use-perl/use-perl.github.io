<div class="span8">
<p><p>
Well, upon uploading the first version of Test::Shlomif::Harness to CPAN,
I had to pick a good name for it. I brainstormed with people on 
<a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/perl/">Freenode's #perl channel</a>,
and eventually thought about something like Test::RunTests. Then I checked
if there was already a module named "Test::Run" and guess what - there wasn't!
</p>

<p>
As a result, Test-Run is the new name and 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Run/">it is now on CPAN</a>.
Test::Run itself is just an API, and is not meant to be called from
the command line directly (for prove or for "make test"). To do that, I also
started to work on 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Run-CmdLine/">Test-Run-CmdLine</a>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, to achieve the summary line in colour (which if you recall was my 
original motivation for this hacktivity), I wrote 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Run-CmdLine-Drivers-ColorSummary/">Test-Run-CmdLine-Drivers-ColorSummary</a>.
The latter is now functional and 
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/81969889%40N00/68430623/">actually 
works</a>. It weights in at 27 lines (excluding comments and POD), but part
of it is quite sub-optimal at the moment, and may be implemented better with
some refactoring of Test::Run.
</p>

<p>
Now for some issues:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
I couldn't figure out how to set tags for the image I posted to 
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>. I thought I have set tags when
I uploaded it, but they weren't being set and the image does not appear on a
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/perl/">lookup of the 
"perl" tag</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I discovered Test::Harness' tests have not tested for the correct output (even
the most elementary stuff like "All tests successful"). After my refactoring
broke some stuff, I had to add some tests like that on my own. I
<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.qa/5116">submitted the extra
    tests</a>, and talked with Andy about it in AIM, but he said that he'd 
rather not add these, because the output itself is "getting redone".
</p>
<p>
If you ask me, I think a test coverage should still cover these things, and be
modified for the new behaviour when it is changed. This is so they'll have
full coverage, and bugs that change the behaviour won't be introduced, when
working or refactoring a code. Working on Test::Run has made me realise that
refactoring without good test coverage can be dangerous.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
At the moment, Test::Run itself depends on Class::Accessor. Is it a bad thing?
Should a module like Test::Run that aims to be in the core eventually, have no
dependencies except those that are distributed in perl? 
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, I can lobby for the inclusion of Class::Accessor into the
core. In my humble opinion, it's high time that it was included.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
While I've been thinking that as far as code quality is concerned Test::Run is 
in pretty good shape, (much more so in comparison to Test::Harness), I often
discover a piece of code there that just cries "refactor me". It is usually
a function that's just too long for its own good. So I end up refactoring it.
But I still appreciate the fact that 
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000348.html">I started 
from a working code</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Reading Parameters from the command line and from %ENV is generally something
I'd like to keep out of Test::Run::Obj itself. That's because I want its entire
behaviour to be controllable from its API. Now, the problem is that I'd like
to people to be able to write sub-classes of Test::Run::Obj that will enhance
and customise it. But these classes may have their own necessary customisations
from the environment or command line. (e.g: the ::ColorSummary module should
have customisable colour codes).
</p>
<p>
So the million Dollars question is whether the sub-classes should handle the
CmdLine/Env handling themselves? Probably not, because a programmer may wish
to control them too, from their API.
</p>
<p>
Right now I'm leaning on both sub-classing Test::Run::Obj and sub-classing
an appropriate command line front-end object. The front-end sub-class will pass
the arguments to the Test::Run::Obj sub-class. And there will probably be a
thin wrapper module that just invokes the appropriate sub-classed front-end.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
"Documentation? We don't need no stinkin' documentation!" Or at least we don't
need an up-to-date documentation. At the moment, most of the documentation 
of Test::Run was preserved almost verbatim from that of Test::Harness and 
was not updated to reflect the newer changes. It needs to be updated.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Naturally, if someone writes one enhancement to Test::Run::Obj as a sub-class,
and someone (else or the same) writes another one, why the two of them
shouldn't be combined? This probably calls for plug-ins like I saw in 
Catalyst. This may mean we'll have to use Module::Pluggable and also the
<tt>NEXT::</tt> meta-class. I don't remember at which major perl 5 version it
was introduced, but in this case, it may mean some enhancements will not be
available in some older perls.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Finally, how you can help: first of all you can submit patches to the 
documentation to update it to the newer code. Or write new documentation for
all them method extractions. Also, if you feel like refactoring one of the
places which is still quite hairy - go for it. You can find the code 
<a href="http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=2352">in the Subversion 
repository</a>. A few patches like that and you'll become a commiter. 
</p>

<p>
A second thing you can do is suggest ways in which you'd like to see Test::Run
(or Test::Harness) enhanced or customised. You can create drivers now, but 
they may become broken even in the not-so-far future, as I didn't settle on the 
API and the Subclassing API yet.
</p>

<p>
And last, but not least, if you find my effort noteworthy, please 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/donate/">consider donating</a>. The
more money I receive by donations, the more financially-worthy it would be
for me to work on Test-Run. If you make a donation
<a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">drop me a note</a> saying why you
did it, so I can try to invest some more time on that particular cause.

<h2>Core modules</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rafael/">rafael</a> on 2005-12-08T15:52:21</h3>
The general line about new core modules is : "no". So, <tt>Class::Accessor</tt> is not going into the core unless it's absolutely necessary to save the world; and I really don't see why we need another test harness in the standard Perl distribution.

<p>
Hi Rafael! Thanks for your response. Now to my comments.
</p>

<blockquote>

</p></div>
</blockquote>

<p>
I see. Well, I suppose I can create an internal Class::Accessor replacement inside Test::Run called something like Test::Run::ClassAcc or whatever, with just the functionality that I need. However, this may create problems with inheriting from Class::Accessor as well, so I'd rather avoid it if I can.
</p>

<p>
One may might as well argue that CGI.pm is not "absolutely necessary" in the Perl distribution, but it was still included because most people ended up installing it separately. Almost all of my modules end up inheriting from Class::Accessor (not to mention that Class::DBI and many other modules also depend on it), and if another candidate for a core module requires it, why not put it there while we're at it.
</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>
Isn't CPANPLUS.pm going to be part of the core Perl distribution? And yet CPAN.pm is still present. However, CPANPLUS.pm is far superior to it. So is Test::Run in comparison to Test::Harness.
</p>

<p>
You may wish to consider <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Shlomi%20Fish/journal/27467" title="perl.org">my previous entry</a perl.org> and the links there for some more information about the advantages offered by Test::Run.
</p>

<p>
On one leg, Test::Run (as opposed to Test::Harness):
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Is fully object oriented. As a result, any methods can easily be overrided by derived classes, making it possible to create customised or enhanced harnesses, while still re-using a lot of the code. Test::Harness, OTOH, is completely procedural.
</li>
<li>
Much more modular. Many methods were extracted (most methods are much shorter)
, duplicate code was eliminated, hashes were created to classes (which is why
I need Class::Accessor), with some utility methods, perl formats were
eliminated, etc.
</li>
<li>
Its internal (and to some extent external) APIs are much cleaner than
those of Test::Harness. The command-line/%ENV handling is being separated from
the core.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The Test::Run code still has some problems, which need to be addressed before
it's ready for prime-time, and I'm not saying it should be included now. But
it's still heading in a better direction, and hope to see it eventually
integrated into Module::Build,  ExtUtils::MakeMaker and other frameworks that
make use of Test::Harness.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, putting it in the core is not a critical issue at the moment. If
Test::Run is good enough, then I believe many people will end up installing
it until it becomes a de-facto standard. But there's still a lot of work to
do (which is why I asked for help).

<h2>Note about the Donations</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Shlomi Fish/">Shlomi Fish</a> on 2005-12-09T11:31:16</h3>
<p>
Replying to myself, I'd like to clarify what I said about the donations. Some people on the IRC claimed what I said sounded like some spam messages, and had some issues with the perceived message. I'd just like to say, that I'm not working on open-source code for the money, but rather out of passion like most other open source developers, who are not employed to do so, are. I will not stop working on Test::Run (or any other project in general), if I don't receive any money.
</p>

<p>
However, I still naturally need money to survive, which is why I'm asking for donations. If I find a steady job, then I will, most probably, have less time to work on open source software. If, on the other hand, I will receive enough money from  donations and from text Ads on my site, then I can invest all my time on working on non-commercial endeavours. This is quite unlikely at this point, but it illustrates a point.
</p>

<p>
What I wanted to say is that if someone gives me a donation, saying he donated it out of appreciation for doing X, then I will try to invest some time enhancing it further, out of appreciation for the donation. But my hacktivity is not conditioned in me receiving donations, and never will be.
</p>

<p>
Hope everything has been clarified now.
</p>



<h2>Adding Tags to a Flick Picture</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Shlomi Fish/">Shlomi Fish</a> on 2005-12-17T21:01:24</h3>
Replying to myself, I'd like to note that I found out that one can add tags to a Flick picture by pressing the "Edit" link to the right of the picture. It's pretty small so I did not notice it.<br><br>Have fun!
