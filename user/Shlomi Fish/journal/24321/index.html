Is the world ready for 
<a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/latemp/">Latemp</a>? After I learned
<a href="http://thewml.org/">Web Meta Language</a>, I used it extensively to
maintain all of my serious sites. What I did when I started working on a new
site was export the templates, makefile and individual files from an old site, 
and then hack on them until they resembled the site I wanted to achieve.
</p>
<p>
As time went by, my knowledge of site design has grown and I built various
new features into the pages, and the build system. However, I still had a lot
of sites that derived from older knowledge and incorporated less advanced
techniques. They had to be constantly forward ported. After I worked on 
the new <a href="http://better-scm.berlios.de/">Better SCM Site</a>, I 
decided that enough is enough and that I should create a content management
system out of what I had so far.
</p>
<p>
So enter <a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/latemp/">Latemp</a> (a play on
"Template"). Latemp combines Web Meta Language with 
<a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/modules/HTML-Widgets-NavMenu/">HTML::Widgets::NavMenu</a>, 
with GNU Make, and with other modules and tools that play a lesser role, and 
transforms them into a coherent, customizable content management system for
static HTML pages. You can take a look at 
<a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/latemp/examples/">some 
    of the sites that I already was able to convert to Latemp</a>. Ironically,
the Better SCM site which was the basis for this, was not converted yet,
because its Subversion repository got corrupted and I have inadequate 
permissions on the server to try and run recover. (I think it was all because
of <a href="http://viewcvs.sourceforge.net/">ViewCVS</a>).
</p>
<p>
<b>Update:</b> Now the Better-SCM has been converted. I had to switch to an older repository in a different hosting, and check in the latest and greatest source from my local working copy.
</p>
<p>
I also took the time to write some 
<a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/latemp/docs/">documentation</a> which 
together with the sources of the examples, should get you up to speed.
</p>
<p>
Have fun filling the web with wonderful sites!
</p>
