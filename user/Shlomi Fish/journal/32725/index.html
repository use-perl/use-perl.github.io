<p><p>
A lot of work has been done on 
<a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/modules/Test-Run/">Test-Run</a> since
the <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Shlomi+Fish/journal/32493">last update</a>
and I'd like to summarise it here.
</p>

<p>
I discovered that when running 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Run-CmdLine/bin/runprove">runprove</a>
(the Test::Run prove counterpart), without any command line arguments then 
it barfed with weird and confusing errors. I fixed it to exit gracefully
without any message in a similar manner to prove.
</p>

<p>
Next, on 12 March, I converted the code to make use of 
<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.qa/2007/03/msg8255.html">TAP::Parser 0.51</a>,
which is the new release of TAPx::Parser, that broke some compatibility with
older versions. Then I released Test-Run 0.0105.
</p>

<p>
I also did a lot of refactoring: removing unused variables, putting classes
in their own .pm modules, extracting methods, moving methods to specialised
classes (instead of passing data from one method to the other) and converting
arguments to instance properties.
</p>

<p>
I mentioned the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Run-Plugin-AlternateInterpreters/">alternate 
interpreters plugin</a> in my previous entry. Well, I
continued to work on it, and released the first few versions on the CPAN. The
first two releases were broken, and I received automated smoking failure
reports for them despite the fact I quickly uploaded newer packages.
</p>

<p>
This weekend (Friday and Saturday) I was sick, but I guess every cloud has
a silver lining because I was able to get a lot of work done. During these
two days I've done 68 commits to the repository, and had a diff in which
I added 2,602 lines and removed (or replaced) 431 lines. (Many of the added
lines are copy-and-paste, template-generated, moves and renames, or otherwise
small tweaks, though). It's been a while since I felt I was so productive.
</p>

<p>
I also worked and released 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Run-Plugin-CollectStats/">Test-Run-Plugin-CollectStats</a>,
which collects and stores data and statistics from the entire test run. I
initially feared it was hard, but it turned out to be easier than I expected.
Doing it properly involved documenting the meaning of the fields of some of the 
struct-like classes I stored there.
</p>

<p>
I did some work on <a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/modules/Test-Run/">the
Test-Run homepage</a> and made it somewhat less embarrassing. Then I 
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/test-run/">added it to Freshmeat</a>
and <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/test-run/?branch_id=68853&amp;release_id=249395">announced a release</a>.
</p>

<p>
I joined irc.perl.org's #parrot to witness the fun of 
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2007/03/parrot_bug_day_on_17_march_200.html">the 
Parrot bug day</a>,
and while I was in the neighbourhood decided to write a patch for Parrot
to have an option of making use of Test::Run to run its tests. It took me
some time to find out what to change, but after I did, the coding itself
was very easy. I submitted 
<a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41877">a 
patch</a> to the bug tracker, and it was applied less than an hour later. Gee,
I love open source!
</p>

<p>
After guiding one of the people who chatted there on how to get Test::Run
configured and to output in colour, he asked how to get the verdicts of the
individual test files ("ok", "NOK", "dubious", etc.) in colour as well. I
told him one will have to write a plugin for that, and then decided
to do it myself. This involved more refactoring to the core Test::Run code,
and I'm still working on it. While I did, I refactored on of the methods
to be this:
</p>

<pre>
sub _get_dubious_message_components
{
    my $self = shift;

    return 
    [
           $self->_get_dubious_message_ml()
        ,  $self->_get_dubious_verdict_message()
        ,  $self->_get_dubious_message_line_end() 
        ,  $self->_get_dubious_status_message_indent_prefix()
        ,  $self->_get_dubious_status_message()
    ];
}
</pre>

<p>
While <tt>_get_dubious_message_line_end</tt> and 
<tt>_get_dubious_status_message_indent_prefix</tt> to read:
</p>

<pre>
sub _get_dubious_message_line_end
{
    return "\n";
}

sub _get_dubious_status_message_indent_prefix
{
    return "\t";
}

</pre>
<p>

<p>
Don't look at me - it seemed like the right thing to do!
</p>

<p>
Next on my agenda is:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
Finish the plugin that colours the test file components, and release it.
</li>

<li>
Write a freshmeat.net announcement with all the new stuff.
</li>

<li>
Write a plugin based on <tt>::CollectStats</tt> that serialises the data
to XML. Write an XSLT stylesheet to transform it into 
<a href="http://www.docbook.org/">DocBook/XML</a>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
That's all folks! Have a lot of fun!
