<p><p>
So I decided I'd like to write my first Perl 6 program, so I can see
what's it like. So I downloaded and compiled Pugs and then started translating
<a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/user/shlomif/lecture/Perl/Graham-Function/">my 
    solution to the Graham function quiz-of-the-week.</a> to Perl 6.
</p>

<p>
So I started the translation. I first translated two small functions, and they
did not work as expected. After I logged on to #perl6 on Freenode, and asked
around it turned out it was a bug. This bug:
</p>

<code>
#!/usr/bin/pugs<br>
<br>
use v6;<br>
<br>
sub func()<br>
{<br>
    my $d = [];<br>
    if (($d.elems() &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; ($d.[0] == 1))<br>
    {<br>
        return 0;<br>
    }<br>
    else<br>
    {<br>
        return $d;<br>
    }<br>
}<br>
<br>
say "func().perl == ", func().perl;<br>
</code>

<p>
This function returned the array instead of 0, and I used a variant of it
in my code. After noting it, Audrey Tang fixed it, and I was able to proceed.
</p>

<p>
Then I encountered another bug. :-). Eventually I got a commit access so I can
put the bugs test files in the t/pugsbugs/ directory. I found two more bugs,
until I finished writing my program. Surprisngly, most of these bugs were
pretty basic, and I wonder how people didn't encounter them earlier.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, after I sorted the expressions' starting sigils, etc. and
all the bugs were fixed in pugs, it worked. Sort of - it still had a horrible
start-up time and was much slower than its perl5 program. But it worked.
</p>

<p>
Audrey told me to commit the converted program into the examples directory
of pugs where the other quiz-of-the-week. Nothingmuch gave me a lot of
commentary on how it can be made more perl6y when he reviewed the code on the
channel, but I was too lazy to do anything about it, so I just commited it
as is. Hopefully someone will hack on it further while it is inside the
pugs repository.
</p>

<p>
So that's it - now back to perl 5 hacking.
