As part of the Hackers-IL wiki, I started writing 
<a href="http://www.hackers.org.il/mediawiki/index.php/A_Brief_History_of_Linux_in_Israel">a brief history of Linux in Israel</a>. Now at first the opening 
paragraph <a href="http://www.hackers.org.il/mediawiki/index.php?title=A_Brief_History_of_Linux_in_Israel&amp;oldid=1568">read</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Israel has been a Capitalistic, prosperous country for a long time. While it
has many problems (such as heavy taxation, irrational and abundant regulations,
quite a lot of terrorist activity, etc.), it is relatively peaceful, has an
abundant food supply...
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
At a point someone was unhappy with it and 
<a href="http://www.hackers.org.il/mediawiki/index.php?title=A_Brief_History_of_Linux_in_Israel&amp;diff=1572&amp;oldid=1568">changed 
it</a> to read only "quite a lot of terrorist activity"). Now, having seen, it
I felt that it was then inaccurate and misleading, because Israel has much
more serious problems than the occassional act of terrorism, despite what
many people have been misled to believe by the International media. So I
completely removed the "such as" parenthesis. 
</p>

<p>
Why am I telling you all this? Because this convergence to mediocricity and 
Political-Correctness of wikis happened again, this time at 
<a href="http://perl.net.au/">PerlNet</a>. Read on for the details.
</p>

<p>
I have a copy of the Linux Journal that a friend bought me when he was
abroad. Its focus was on blogs, wikis, audiocasts, etc. One of the most amusing
articles there was a rant by an editor about why he hates wikis. And in it,
one keeps seeing edits and re-edits of the text by the surfers, as if it were
a wiki article. Paul Graham also 
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/web20.html">wrote about it</a> in a 
different context:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
My experience of writing for magazines suggests an explanation. Editors. They
control the topics you can write about, and they can generally rewrite whatever
you produce. The result is to damp extremes. Editing yields 95th percentile
writing&#8212;95% of articles are improved by it, but 5% are dragged down. 5% of the
time you get "throngs of geeks."
</p>

<p>
On the web, people can publish whatever they want. Nearly all of it falls short
of the editor-damped writing in print publications. But the pool of writers is
very, very large. If it's large enough, the lack of damping means the best
writing online should surpass the best in print. [3] And now that the web has
evolved mechanisms for selecting good stuff, the web wins net. Selection beats
damping, for the same reason market economies beat centrally planned ones.
</p>
</blockquote> 

<p>
Now a wiki gives the power of editing to the masses, so it may get worse. Often
you'll see a state of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock#Livelock">livelock</a>, where
two or more people keep changing one another's content. Or alternatively to
satisfy everybody, the wiki converges to a commonly acceptable 
pseduo-"politically-correct" content.
</p>

<p>
I admit I've been guilty of such abuse as well. For example I once edited the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberians">Wikipedia article about the
Iberians</a> to say that they were an Afro-Asian people, while they in fact
were not. This eventually got reverted, and the article as it stands now is
otherwise much richer than what was there when I first read it.
</p>

<p>
Now for PerlNet. The 
<a href="http://perl.net.au/wiki/Freenode_Sharp_Perl_FAQ">Freenode 
#perl FAQ</a> is hosted there because I'd like it to be a wiki page,
and perl.net.au is my favourite "central" Perl wiki. One of the sections there
describes the channel regulars. I wrote this in the about "beth" there:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
beth, also known as 
<a href="http://loxosceles.org/">Beth Skwarecki</a> is a Biology graduate from 
Ithaca, New York, the United States, who studied Perl in order to deal with 
Bio-Informatics. Surprisingly, she knows her Perl (and UNIX) pretty well. Due 
to her knowledge and 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/images/Friends/freenode/beth/beth-in-waterfall.jpg">good looks</a>, she had been unofficially considered as the 
channel diva.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Now, Jarich (an admin of perl.net.au) <a href="http://perl.net.au/wiki/?title=Freenode_Sharp_Perl_FAQ&amp;diff=7449&amp;oldid=7448">changed it</a> to read:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
beth, also known as Beth Skwarecki is a Biology graduate from Ithaca, 
New York, the United States, who studied Perl in order to deal with 
Bio-Informatics.  Beth is the unofficial #perl channel diva.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Now, while the original version probably left somethings to be desired, I feel
that the new version as it stands now, is much lamer, lost most of its colour,
and is much more cryptic. (Why is Beth the unofficial #perl channel diva?)
</p>

<p>
When talking with Jarich on the IRC, she asked me if I had rights to put
beth' waterfall photo on my website. I told her that I originally found this
photo on beth' site, and downloaded it to my machine so it was temporarily
used as a wallpaper for one of my virtual workspaces. Then I uploaded it
to my site because it was a great photo and I could no longer find it on the
site of beth, and Flickr and Google weren't any help. (And in case you're
wondering and haven't clicked on the photo yet, Beth is fully groomed there.)
</p>

<p>
She also said that I was patronising the fact that she surprisingly knows Perl 
very well just because she's a woman. However, the reason I said that was
because Perl is the first language Beth has learned (and so far only one), and 
she hasn't been working with it too much, and because she otherwise hasn't
been a computer geek for too long. (And has many other interests and talents 
besides computing.). So I'm not patronising her because of her sex, but rather 
say she is surprisingly doing very well. I indeed did not specifically
mention it in what I wrote, but would rather see such an explanation added than
the sentence deleted.
</p>

<p>
And naturally the new paragraph does not explain why she is considered the
unofficial channel diva. And Jarich told me she further believed that the 
other paragraph that gives a link to most of the other "real-life" interests 
of Beth is patronising, just because one of them happens to be knitting
and sewing. Beth has chosen to put all her life online on her home site, blog
and Flickr stream. I'm pretty sure she wouldn't mind those two paragraphs
on the Freenode #perl FAQ.
</p>

<p>
I've ranted about this for a long time now, disproportionally to the length of 
the original text, and the time it would take me to reach a compromise. I was
trying to illustrate a point about wikis and collaborative work in general:
while it is important that everyone will have access and possibly even
modification rights to every aspect of the project, one should make sure that
people don't step on each other toes. Even if something is shared, there is
the concept of propriety. 
</p>

<p>
As Paul Graham notes later on in his articles, the top 1% of blogs, due to the
fact they are un-edited and written by the top 1% of bloggers, eventually 
achieve or exceed the quality of the articles in the magazine, who due to 
their heavy editing, often lose a lot of their edge. Wikis suffer from a
similar problem.
</p>

<p>
I still think wikis are a great concept, and have proven and will probably
prove to have a huge potential. However, I think that there are some temporary
growing pains for some wikis, in which many people misbehave or abuse their
power. And what I described here is not the only problem faced by wikipedia
and other popular wikis. I hope that the text of the wikis of the future, won't 
fall to the Paul Graham "95%-high-quality" syndrome, and instead will be 
better than that.

The original statement written about "beth" does come off like "wow, she is a woman and she knows Perl." It does read, at least to me, in a condescending way. While you explain why she is the unofficial diva, you should restructure that sentence a little to mean what you think it means.

<p>To me it read like a non-sequitur &#8211; I had no idea why that would be surprising. I did wonder whether the writer was surprised because she&#8217;s a woman, but there was no clear referee for the surprisingness in that text, so I drew no conclusion. It just seemed random and pointless.</p>

<p>The text was <em>quite clearly</em> in need of editing, contrary to Shlomi&#8217;s apparent conviction that editors only serve to castrate writing.</p>

<p>
Yes, you are probably right. In this case, however, the right thing to do would be to complain about it in the Page talk page, or to me by email, or perhaps add an inline paragraph in the text with "FIXME" so I'll notice.
</p>

<p>
Removing the offending text just because it's offensive, and converting it to a more boring version is similar to removing a feature from a program because it introduced several bugs. It's the wrong way to think about the problem.
</p>

<p>
And I hope you agree that in the first case (the Israel issue) it was the wrong thing to do, and that my post was indicative of a larger inherent issue with wikis.

<p>Do you <em>seriously</em> mean that?</p>

<p>Writing something that may be offensive about another person, in public, who doesn't want to talk to you is okay, as long as it's not boring?</p>

<p>Shlomi, this is why you get banned from various places.  Your approach to dealing with other people is broken.  Even if you don't understand that other people have feelings or <em>why</em> they feel the way they do, if you barrel on and trample all over those feelings, they're going to react in ways that you don't like.</p>

<p>No matter how rational you think you're being, no matter how logical and non-emotional the arguments are in your own head, you have emotions and moods and little irrationalities as much as anyone else.</p>

<p>You'll have a lot more success dealing with other people if you accept both of those facts.</p>

<p>
I'll consider the diva thing. But it is a fact that we still consider her this way. Perhaps phrasing it in a different way is possible.
</p>

<p>
I should note that in Hebrew it sounds strange to call a woman a "guru", because Hebrew has gender-distinction and "guru" is a masculine word. Now we could say "guru'ith", but it sounds incredibly strange, and "diva" is much nicer, and sounds more sexy. According to the wikipedia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diva" title="wikipedia.org">a Diva is used to describe "any extremely independent and talented woman"</a wikipedia.org>. There's also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divo" title="wikipedia.org">Divo</a wikipedia.org>. Both "Diva" and "Divus" are from Latin, while "guru" is an Indian word.
</p>

<p>
I could say Beth has been considered the channel unofficial female guru. I'll think about it.

I tried asking her, but she never responds to what I say, and like I said has been incredibly inactive. I know for a fact that she doesn't<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>/ignore me</tt>, but she may find my questions and the interest I show in her a bit annoying. She also didn't reply to my email. If she complains, I'll paraphrase what I said, but if she is worried about what people would think about her from the Freenode #perl FAQ, she should be twice as worried from the stuff she puts on her own.
</p>

<p>
Don't get me wrong, there's nothing particularly bad there, but people can still think more lowly of her, because of that due to prejudice. And no, as you know - I'm not better in this regard, and don't mind having most of my life online (privacy and ethos non-withstanding of course). Like Richard Feynman, I don't care too much what every random joe think of me.

<p>
OK. Sorry about that. (And for the record - the word "sexy" did not appear anywhere in what I wrote on the wiki, or here).
</p>

<p>
As for being a "diva" - you should take it as a compliment. (A "diva" is female for "guru"). What I meant was that you were the primary female guru of Freenode's #perl.

I suppose I can, in fact. The question is - how exactly? In one presentation I attended there was a short attribution blurb below any CC-licensed photo, which was kind of annoying. At the moment, the photo is lying in a web-served directory - only the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.jpg file. I will add an "ATTRIBUTION.html" file if it will comply with the licence.
</p>

<p>
In any case, I can correct the dis-information on the wiki in accordance with your input, or you can do it yourself. Please just register first, so we won't mistake it for vandalism.

<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2007-05-29T18:50:48</h3>
<p>You astound me time and again, Shlomi.</p>

<ul> <li>

<p>Firstly, ob the text about <tt>beth</tt>, I agree with Alias: pointing out her looks and that she is the &#8220;channel diva&#8221; is what seems patronising to me. And if she&#8217;s not replying, just <em>maybe</em> you should not assume it&#8217;s fine to put these things in the wiki?</p>

<p>Something appropriate, according to how you&#8217;ve described her here, would read like this:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><p>beth, also known as Beth Skwarecki, is a Biology graduate from Ithaca, New York, the United States, who studied Perl in order to deal with Bio-Informatics. She doesn&#8217;t actually use it much and is isn&#8217;t very active in the channel, but surprisingly, she still knows her Perl well.</p></div> </blockquote>

<p>Try that on for size and let&#8217;s see if it gets challenged.</p>

</li> <li>

<p>Secondly, on your point about editors: newspapers articles are edited by a single person. Active wikis are edited by large multitude of people. Are you at all familiar with the conclusions of <a href="http://tomayko.com/articles/2006/10/27/galtons-ox" title="tomayko.com">Galton&#8217;s <i>Vox Populi</i> paper</a tomayko.com>?</p>

<p>Not that it even matters, because you refute yourself without even noticing:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><p>the top 1% of bloggers, eventually achieve or exceed the quality of the articles in the magazine, who due to their heavy editing, often lose a lot of their edge</p></div> </blockquote>

<p>Are you seriously suggesting that everyone who <em>adds</em> to wikis is as good as the top 1% of essayists and journalists whose writing is so good that editors would dull rather than improve it? Because, of course, what Graham <em>also</em> says (on which you did not quote him) is that the other 99% of writers <em>do</em> actually <em>benefit</em> from an editor brushing up their work.</p>

<p>Guess which group most people adding to wikis belong to?</p>

<p>
Allow me to now invoke my corrolary to Godwyn's law, as applied to Perl-related discussions: whenever people start to criticse the personal character or behaviour of Shlomi Fish (= me), then every discussion is over, because it has deteriorated and will only deteriorate further.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to thank the first three top-posters, and others who kept this discussion on the original topic (i.e: a wiki editing pattern and good wiki netiqutte), without throwing personal accusation of me or anything. But it is obvious that at least two people here (you can tell who they are by their comments), who I otherwise have high respects for, could not help but going into personal attacks of mine.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for playing!

</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>(15:30:24) jarich: rindolf: Saying that it's surprising someone knows Perl and UNIX "pretty well" is offensive, because it suggests that the default assumption should be otherwise.<br>(15:30:47) jarich: since you don't link to photos for the others, I think it's odd to link to a photo just because it's of a female<br>(15:31:11) jarich: I'm not quite sure the diva bit needs to be mentioned at all<br> <br>[comment from other user]<br> <br>(15:36:15) jarich: well "beth" is likely to be female....&nbsp; If the channel has some sort of importance associated with the idea of the "channel diva" then it's relevant and should stay.&nbsp; If Beth gets the title just because she's the best (or only) known woman then.... it's probably being sexist.<br>(15:37:04) jarich: sorry: not "it is relevant" after all it's "unofficial", maybe "it may be relevant"</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>
You didn't respond at all... until now.

I didn't say you were patronising; or even that you're implying that her skill is surprising just because she's female.  I didn't mention her real life interests, although another channel user did.   But I'm happy to respond anyway.

You wrote in another comment:
</p> <p><blockquote><div>"diva" is much nicer, and sounds more sexy.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Are you aware of how ick that sounds?  Most people are not "sexy" professionally (or they shouldn't be).  When dealing with people in a technical context I never want to be viewed as "sexy" just because I'm a woman.  I don't even want to be viewed as sexy because someone has seen photos of me.  I want to interact with my technical peers in a professional, technical way.  I'd like to think that they have both hands on the keyboard at all times; that it'd be nice (rather than unpleasant or scary) to meet them in real life.  I would be uncomfortable to find out that a photo of me was used as a wallpaper for a technical peer of mine who I'd never met in real life.

It's a wiki and you can fix it.  So can other Freenode #perl users.  As you said above, this matter doesn't really deserve such a long rant.  Be aware though that every time you edit a page on perlnet you are warned:
</p> <p><blockquote> <div><b>
If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly [...] then don't submit it here.
</b></div> </blockquote>
<p>
I will continue to edit all and any articles on PerlNet where I feel I can improve them.

<p><blockquote> <div><i>
I told [Jarich] that I originally found this photo on beth' site, and downloaded it to my machine so it was temporarily used as a wallpaper [....] (And in case you're wondering and haven't clicked on the photo yet, Beth is fully groomed there.)

<p>
That is a very creepy paragraph to read. Beth is probably taking precautionary measures, like carrying pepper spray on the off chance that you show up on campus one day for an unexpected stalker visit.</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with some general trend toward blandness and political correctness of edited content. It would be one thing if you were good friends with Beth, and had a rapport where you could joke around with her, but I have the impression that this is not the case at all, however desperately you want it to be, and that you're creeping her (and Jarich) out.</p>
<p>
I also agree with others that "Surprisingly, she knows her Perl (and UNIX) pretty well. Due to her knowledge and good looks, she had been unofficially considered as the channel diva" sounds really condescending. "surprisingly", "pretty well", "due to<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... good looks". If you were intending to be complimentary, you really need to work on your writing skills (not to mention your people skills, but I don't have much room to talk there, being fairly socially retarded myself<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) ).
