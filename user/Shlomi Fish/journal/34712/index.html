I started

the transcript</a> for 
<a href="http://perlcast.com/2006/02/09/interview-with-tom-limoncelli/">this 
Perlcast interview with Tom Limoncelli</a>. I could use some help, in either
transcripting more of the interview, or going over what was already
transcripted, and correcting it.

<p>
I marked words that I could not understand with <tt>*FILL IN*</tt> and words 
that I was not sure if they are correct with <tt>[?]</tt>. Be bold and edit,
but please log in to the wiki first.

<h2>unclear speech</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mr_bean/">mr_bean</a> on 2007-10-19T14:01:43</h3>
I was also unable to tell what most of the unclear comments were. But some I was able to hear were:
<br> <br>
The one at 9:07: 'and use them _EVEN FOR OUR OWN_ personal planning.'
<br> <br>
TL:  the  Palm  Pilot  software  is  great  software,  but  it has a lot of areas of improvements,  shall I say. If you purchase _DATEBK_ five, for example, it enhances Palm  _OS_  to give you all the different features that you would need to do a much  better  job at time management. And in fact everything with the cycle works if you use _DATEBK_ five. That's from PIMLICO software.
<br> <br>
Sometime after 13:16
<br> <br>
They said, well, finally, _I CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT_ the hell you do all day.
<br> <br>
Time management's an interesting subject. One trick I have at work is leaving everything to the last minute. That way, I can beat Parkinson's Law, which is, Work expands to fill the time available.
<br> <br>
He has an interesting observation on his website:
<br> <br>
        [T]here are three points in the class
        where I say things that make people say,
        "That can't be possible!" and then
        realize that it is possible because of a
        simple technique or skill that I've just
        taught. Each time this happens I feel
        like I've told people that I've invented
        faster-than-light travel and then
        demonstrated it.
