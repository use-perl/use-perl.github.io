<h1>XML::RSS Update: Full Test Coverage</h1>

<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/shlomif/363258995/">Read it and weep</a>: 
XML::RSS now has full test coverage - 
<a href="http://svn.perl.org/modules/XML-RSS/trunk/">in the Subversion 
trunk</a> at least, but
coming to a CPAN mirror near you. On the day after 
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Shlomi+Fish/journal/32121">my last update</a>,
I spent some time increasing the test coverage, and ran into a few dillemas
with which I had to consult <a href="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/">Ask</a>.
He indeed provided some useful advice.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday (and a bit before) I spent some time on further increasing the 
test coverage - this time mainly in the parsing stage. I had to modify the
core code slightly to allow for better coverage, and to fix some bugs that
were caused by that. Here are some things I discovered in the process that
may prove useful:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
It is actually possible to have an XML element of an undefined 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">XML namespace</a>
inside a document with a default defined namespace. To do that one can use
the attribute <tt>xmlns=""</tt> on an element. 
</p>
<p>
XML::RSS had a check for such a case and I needed to verify that it is
actually possible.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
One can update a 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-Cover/">Devel::Cover</a> database
incrementally by using the following pattern:
</p>
<pre>
# Run the test script.
# You can also use prove instead of runprove

HARNESS_PERL_SWITCHES="-MDevel::Cover" runprove --blib t/0.9-strict.t

# Update the display.

cover
</pre>
<p>
From some reason, however, Devel::Cover sometimes forced me to use "cover
-delete" and run all the test scripts through it again, but still this pattern
can sometimes be a huge time saver.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The script <tt>items-are-0.t</tt> which I wrote when I started to bug-fix the
"values equal 0" bug, and continued to implement various RSS generation tests
there, itself yields a total coverage of 88.5%. And it is larger and has
more line than the XML::RSS .pm module itself.
</p>

<p>
I initially wanted to give some statistics about the code and the tests, but
I think it would be a waste of time, and you can always calculate them by
checking out the code from the repository. Next on my agenda is to refactor
the code, fix rt.cpan.org bugs, and possibly also enhance it a bit. XML::RSS
uses a lot of hard-coded maps implemented as hash tables and I'd like to 
make them more customisable.
</p>

<p>
Cheers everybody!
