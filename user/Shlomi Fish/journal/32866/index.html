In addition to the Chuck Norris facts, the 
<a href="http://geekz.co.uk/schneierfacts/">Bruce Schneier facts</a> and
the <a href="http://geekz.co.uk/esrfacts/">Eric S. Raymond facts</a>, I decided
to start writing some "Larry Wall facts":
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Larry Wall can understand the Perl code he wrote last year.
</li>

<li>
Larry Wall gets the colon.
</li>

<li>
There are at least 137 Larry Walls in the U.S. but only one that matters.
</li>

<li>
Larry Wall applies a patch manually quicker than GNU patch.
</li>

<li>
Larry Wall dreams in Perl.
</li>

<li>
Larry Wall can program in his sleep.
</li>

<li>
Larry Wall is lazy, impatient and full of hubris.
</li>

<li>
Larry Wall has more dollars in the bank than in his Perl code.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
More additions are welcome.

<p>I don't think Mr. Wall would agree with this one:</p> <p><div class="quote">There are at least 137 Larry Walls in the U.S. but only one that matters.</div>  <p>Minor quibble I know...</p>

Larry Wall applies a patch manually quicker than GNU patch (which he himself wrote).

Larry did not write GNU patch. GNU patch may have been a fork of his patch program (though I doubt it), but I think it was a rewrite. In any case, GNU patch has much more features than the original patch by lwall, which is now good enough only as a historical curiousity.
</p>

<p>
That put aside, I was hoping people would come up with more funny facts of their own. Did April Fools' (or Passover) ate your sense of humour?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

The GNU patch says:<p><blockquote><div>Larry Wall wrote the original version of patch.</div></blockquote><br>As well as:<p><blockquote><div>Copyright (C) 1984, 1985, 1986, 1988 Larry Wall.</div></blockquote><br>Yes, I imagine there is little (if any) of Larry's code left but I figured it was true enough for a joke!<br><br>I also thought of it a being a nice reference to the "bolder so heavy" (or "burrito so hot") type question.

Cool! Thanks for the research and letting us know. Here's <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/net.bugs/browse_thread/thread/483259dbc938d02a/a6d60c6f925e4e88" title="google.com">the original patch announcement</a google.com> as far as I could tell. I still don't know whether its licence was GPL or BSD.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, it's nice that some of the people at the GNU project are re-using code like this. I do wish they did not have the tendency to convert perfectly fine BSD/Public Domain code into the GPL or LGPL.
