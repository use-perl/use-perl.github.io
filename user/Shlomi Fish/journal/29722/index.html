<p><p>
As part of my ongoing effort to create a better web-based newsreader for 
<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/">nntp.perl.org</a>, I'd like to take a 
look at its current code, to learn exactly how things are done. (especially,
the RSS feeds generation).
</p>

<p>
However, I am unable to find out where to find this code. There used to be
a perl.org repository under svn.perl.org, with an account of guest, but
this account has been disabled (at least with the original password which
I was given and which I otherwise was able to find). I sent an email to the
Perl NOC guys (Ask BjÃÂ¸rn Hansen and Robert Spier) about a week ago, but still
haven't received any reply from either (not even an acknowledgement). I tried
talking to Ask on Jabber (twice) but he did not respond.
</p>

<p>
So I'd like to query the knowledge and wisdom of the collective Perl community
about where I can find the source code for nntp.perl.org. If you can help,
please post a comment below. (Or otherwise 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/me/contact-me/">contact me</a>.)
</p>

<p>
As for some news about CGI-Application-NetNewsIface itself: I released the
first non-developers release on CPAN (version 0.0101), in order to help reach
the 10,000 CPAN modules barrier before YAPC::NA. Since then, I quite stopped
working on it (due to my new full-time job and a voluntary project I'm 
involved in.) Yesterday and today however, I added support for a MySQL-based 
cache (a very small code modification), and also added a front page, and an 
"About this App" page. Both are in the Subversion repository.
</p>

<p>
I'd really like to add RSS-support next, which is why I'd like to take a look
at the code of www.nntp.perl.org.
</p>

Well, Ask has responded to me in Jabber, and gave me a link to the code that generates the RSS. So I think I'll be OK now.<br><br>Thanks, Ask!<br>



<h2>Atom</h2>

<p>Forget RSS, generate Atom. It&#8217;s better in every way.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m currently putting the last touches on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Atom-SimpleFeed/" title="cpan.org">XML::Atom::SimpleFeed</a cpan.org> before I stick a fork in it and ship it.</p>

<p>
Except for not being RSS 1.0. (Ha ha only serious!)</p>

<p>Atom still has a number of advantages over RSS 1.x. If you aren&#8217;t using an RDF parser to read RSS 1.x, but just parsing its serialisation with an XML parser (as almost everyone does&#8230;), then Atom is clearly preferrable. But yeah, <i>RSS 1.x via an RDF parser</i> vs. <i>Atom via an XML parser</i> is a close race.</p>

Well, your suggestion is orthogonal to my original problem. What I wanted to do is find out what exactly should be placed in the feed (be it RSS or Atom) and how exactly it is generated.<br><br>Other than that, I'd like to generate RSS 2.0 first, because some feed-readers don't support Atom yet. But I'll keep your suggestion in mind, and eventually implement Atom support.<br>

<p>I hear that objection somewhat frequently, but so far noone has actually pointed out an aggregator which doesn&#8217;t support Atom, just said that &#8220;some don&#8217;t.&#8221; Can you name one?</p>
