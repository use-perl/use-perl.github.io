<p><p>
I haven't updated this journal in a long time, and mostly been writing
in my <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/">LiveJournal
Technical blog</a>. I've emailed to <a href="http://perlsphere.net/">the
Perlsphere</a> maintainer about including that blog there (once from
my home address and once from gmail.com), but received no reply, and so far
it is not included there.
</p>

<p>
In any case, this post is about
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/File-Find-Object/">File-Find-Object,
which is an object-oriented alternative to the core File::Find module</a>.
Originally by <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/nanardon/">Nanardon</a>,
I've maintained it since version 0.0.3.
</p>

<p>
Recently, I've been meaning to write a project, and contemplated whether
to use File-Find-Object or roll-out my own directory traversal logic, but
then decided that improving F-F-O so it will do what I want was a better idea,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_one%27s_own_dog_food">in an
"Eating one's own dog food"</a> and not-re-inventing the wheel fashion.
So I needed to extend F-F-O to do what I want.
</p>

<p>
While I took a closer look at the code to inspect it, I found it had some
"bad smells", and decided to fix it by refactoring, as a necessary 
pre-requisite for extending it.
</p>

<p>
The first thing I did was notice that many methods accepted a <tt>$current</tt>
parameter that was passed from one method to another, and then used. As it
turned out, most of these simply originate from 
<tt>$self-&gt;_current()</tt>, which I now used to retrieve the value in
each method, without passing a parameter.
</p>

<p>
Another fact I noticed was that there were many 
<tt>if ($self eq $current)</tt> checks in the code. Since <tt>$current</tt>
is dynamic, I decided to create a predicate <tt>_is_top()</tt> which will 
encapsulate it and to create the following method maker:
</p>

<pre>
sub _top_it
{
    my ($pkg, $methods) = @_;

    no strict 'refs';
    foreach my $method (@$methods)
    {
        *{$pkg."::".$method} =
            do {
                my $m = $method;
                my $top = "_top_$m";
                my $non = "_non_top_$m";
                sub {
                    my $self = shift;
                    return $self->_is_top()
                        ? $self->$top(@_)
                        : $self->$non(@_)
                        ;
                };
            };
    }

    return;
}
</pre>

<p>
Thus, when _is_top evaluates to true I call <tt>_top_mymethod</tt>
and otherwise <tt>_non_top_mymethod</tt>. This is a variation on
the <a 
href="http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/replace-conditional-with-polymorphism">"replace
conditional with polymorphism" refactoring</a>.
</p>

<p>
Now <tt>-&gt;_current()</tt> returned the 
<tt>-&gt;_current_idx()</tt>'th item from an internal stack
representing the directories which the object is traversing. I wanted
to see where "_current_idx" was set and discovered it was incremented when
an item was pushed to the stack, and decremented when an item was popped.
As a result, I eliminated "_current_idx" completely and replaced 
<tt>_current()</tt> with <tt>$self-&gt;_dir_stack()-&gt;[-1]</tt>. That
removed a lot of cruft from the code.
</p>

<p>
I also was able to do what I wanted, and make sure the paths are maintained
as the base path for the traversal followed by a list of extra components of
each inner directory. 
</p>

<p>
I noticed that I flat-copied the return of a method returning
an array reference several times (E.g: 
<tt>[ @{$self-&gt;_components()} ]</tt>) and so created another method 
maker - this time for "_copy" methods.
</p>

<p>
And naturally, I extracted many methods.
</p>

<p>
All this enabled me to create <tt>-&gt;next_obj()</tt> and 
<tt>-&gt;item_obj()</tt> API methods that return objects instead of plain
strings. Naturally, this is not refactoring, but extending.
</p>

<p>
While I was in the neighbourhood, I discovered that <a 
href="http://www.securiteam.com/unixfocus/6S00L20MUE.html">the code
had a format-string-issue</a>, which I fixed, and released
File-Find-Object-0.1.1 immediately.
</p>

<p>
After the release, I received three failure reports from CPAN Testers. Two
of them were for a missing dependency, that wasn't installed due to a bug
in the tests' smoking setup. One of them, however, was for Win32, where it
was a real bug. I was able to reproduce it using Strawberry Perl on my WinXP
computer, and released File-Find-Object-0.1.2 that corrected it. The problem
was that on non-cygwin-Win32 all inodes are returned as 0 in the calls to
stat().
</p>

<p>
Today, I started writing the project that required all this work on 
File-Find-Object. So far it doesn't do much, but it's a start.
