<h1>Plugins for Helper Objects</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>
In this entry, I'd like to discuss an OOP technique of having a class with
plugins, where the plugins specify plugins for the objects used ("has-a")
by instances of the class. 
</p>

<p>
This occured to me in 
<a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/modules/Test-Run/">Test-Run</a>, where
I implemented several classes which I called "Structs" (like in C) which
wrapped around a hash ref using accessors. The instances of these classes
were referenced by the main class ("Test::Run::Core"). I graudually moved 
more and more methods into the helper classes, if I saw they only referred 
to their own data.
</p>

<p>
Now, I have some plugins of the Test::Run::Core class. It happened to me
at least once now, that after I moved a few methods to the helper classes,
the plugin broke, because the method in question was no longer present in
the main class. I had to find a way to <b>extend the helper 
classes</b>, and it made me thinking that I'd like to have some plugins 
for it too.
</p>

<p>
Plugins in Perl, at least as implemented by Catalyst and Test-Run, are done
by creating an empty class (let's say <tt>MyPluggableClass</tt>), adding all 
the plugins, in front to <tt>@MyPluggableClass::ISA</tt>, and adding the master
class which the plugins enhance at the end. So <tt>@MyPluggableClass::ISA</tt>
will look something like:
</p>

<pre>
( qw(Plugin::Foo Plugin::Bar Plugin::Quux MasterClass) )
</pre>

<p>
Now, I'd like a way for plugins of the Test::Run main class, to add plugins
to its helper classes. I already have some code to traverse the inheritance
tree and collect an array from the individual methods (shamelessly borrowed
from a similar paradigm in <tt>Class::Std</tt>). Using it, I can collect
all the plugins, append the master class at the end, and initialise a new
instance of the helper class.
</p>

<p>
I can even abstract this functionality into its own meta class. So my questions
are:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
Was this done before?
</li>

<li>
Is there a better way to do it?
</li>

<li>
Does <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Moose/">Moose</a> support a
similar paradigm?
</li>

<li>
Should I rethink my strategy?
</li>

</ol>

<p>
I think one big monolithic class is not the way to go, so I'd appreciate any
comments.
</p>
</p>

OK, so I suppose that as far as consulting you, my way is good enough.

Nice. In any case, I was looking for a built-in or default way for plugins of main classes to specify the plugins of the helper classes, without me having to write too much helper code. What you showed was a generic plugin mechanism for Moose, not such a way. What I want is still doable, but should still be done explicitly.

OK, no problem.
