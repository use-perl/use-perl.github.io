<p><p>
While 
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Shlomi+Fish/journal/30039">I'm working with PHP
    now at work</a>, I still like to do some Perl hacking once in a while. As
it turned out, this weekend (an extended one due to the fact we were given
Thursday off because of
<a href="http://www.hebcal.com/holidays/tzom-tammuz.html">Tzom Tammuz</a>.),
I spent a lot of time working on Perl and Perl-related projects. This entry
aims to summarise what I've done so far, and what I'd like to do in the remains
of the weekend and the upcoming days.
</p>

<p>
I uploaded 4 modules to the CPAN this weekend:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
    <p>
    <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-Search-MSN/">WWW-Search-MSN</a> 
    (version 0.0102). This fixed a small Build.PL bug where Encode was not
    mentioned in the dependencies, which caused "./Build test" to silently
    fail on perl 5.6.1 and below. (I always thought Encode was part of the
    core since perl 5.6.0, but I guess I had been wrong).
    </p>
    <p>
    This bug was reported by <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/purdy/">purdy</a>
    who's now credited in the Changes file (but not in the POD yet). There's
    another bug in the RT, but I may have fixed it in the process of getting
    W-S-MSN to recognise <tt>https://</tt> URLs.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTML-Latemp-GenMakeHelpers/">HTML-Latemp-GenMakeHelpers</a> - this 
    <a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/latemp/">Latemp</a>-assisting module
    was enhanced a bit. I used to use the wml interpreter with redirection 
    (<tt>&gt; $@</tt>) but this had a tendency to create empty files upon 
    failure. Now it's more robust. While the make commands are written in
    shell, I had to use a <tt>File::Spec-&gt;rel2abs()</tt> invocation for
    getting the absolute location. Maybe there's a better way to do it in
    pure bash.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Error/">Error</a> has been updated
    to version 0.17. A lot of the enhancements in it are the work of 
    <a href="http://www.leonerd.org.uk/">LeoNerd</a>, which was given commit
    access to the Subversion repository. Other enhancements include
    an examples directory with some useful examples. (by LeoNerd and me).
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    Last but not least is 
    <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/File-Find-Object/">File-Find-Object</a>,
    version 0.0.3,
    which as mentioned in this journal earlier is a File::Find replacement with
    some advantages like being instantiable and the fact that the directory 
    tree traversal scan can be stopped in the middle. This version has 
    some cleanups, a more comprehensive test suite (with some meta-tests for 
    the testing API ;-)), etc. 
    </p>
    <p>
    It aims to be the last release before we convert the code to use
    File::Spec, as well as clean up the internals. At the moment
    File::Find::Object::internal is derived from File::Find::Object, and
    each of them contain one of the other. I told
    <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/nanardon/">the original
        maintainer</a> that I'd like to convert it into one class and
    one object, possibly with some helper objects of completely different
    classes.
    </p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
But CPAN was not the only thing I worked on this weekend. I also started
working on the site of 
<a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/Fullperl/">a top-secret Perl 
    distribution</a> (ssshh! Don't tell anyone). I don't mind sharing this
idea, because ideas are cheap, but I'd like to make a more official
announcement when I have something to show for. (such as packages for one
Linux distribution).
</p>

<p>
I also did some wiki work on 
<a href="http://perl.net.au/">http://perl.net.au/</a> and the Wikipedia. Another
plan of mine was to start seriously learning Common Lisp this weekend. However,
<a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/lispbox/">Lisp in a Box</a> refused to 
build cleanly on my Linux machine. I guess I'll have to install XEmacs, SLIME 
and CLisp or SBCL the "hard way". I wonder if SLIME and one of Emacs' 
vi-emulation modes can play together well.
</p>

<p>
Finally, what would be a weekend without IRC? On #perlcafe we discussed
Politics, religion, Julian Jaynes' Theory of the emergence of Human sentience,
history and archaelogy and everything in between. Someone there seemed to
have understood what I wanted to say (about animals not being sentient and
about humans not having sentience until roughly ~1,000 B.C.) almost right
away. Either he's more open for this, or I'm getting better at explaining
this. 
</p>

<p>
On #perl, we discussed many things with most of the regulars. One thing we
touched upon was whether C has its place (buu does not seem to think so, but
trying to convince him is futile), and also whether the fact that in perl
doing <tt>$myobj-&gt;method_name()</tt> without knowing anything about 
<tt>$myobj</tt> and the interpreter just does the "right" thing is good 
or not. In C++, for example, it's impossible, yet some people feel it's 
better from "software engineery" point-of-view.
</p>

<p>
Finally, sili, mjl69 and I have decided to form the 
perl-lovers-who-are-forced-to-use-PHP-against-their-will support group:<br />
-- "Hi! My name is Shlomi, and I'm getting paid to write PHP code." <br/>
-- "Hello Shlomi! We all love you!"<br />
</p>

<p>
In any case - cheers!
</p>

</p>

<h2>your top secret perl distribution</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dagolden/">dagolden</a> on 2006-07-15T12:24:42</h3>
<p>As you work on the "top secret" distribution, keep an eye out for Perl::Dist.  Right now it's a terribly hacky conversion of scripts to a module and far too hardcoded towards <a href="http://vanillaperl.com/" title="vanillaperl.com">Vanilla/Strawberry Perl</a vanillaperl.com> builds.  It needs to be rebuilt from the ground up, but conceptually, it's going to be going in a direction that should be useful to you.</p>

<p>In working on Vanilla and Strawberry, I can say that it's an amazing, gleefully cool feeling to type:</p>

<code>
&gt; perl bin\build_all.pl
</code>

<p>And then watch 100 Meg of Perl plus compiler plus modules download and assemble themselves into a working perl distribution.</p>

<p>(Er, except for the occasionally annoying "monkey hit the button" moments in various Makefile.PL's)</p>

<p>
Thanks for the tip.
</p>

<p>
In any case, my intention in Fullperl is to individually package each Perl CPAN module in its own system distribution's package, with external dependencies on the other (C-based, etc.) packages in the system's distribution. So one can still manage them using apt-get on debian, urpmi on Mandriva, yum on Red Hat, emerge on Gentoo, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
I'll make a more official announcement when I have something more substantial to show for.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I think that Makefile.PL has a standard flag or env vars to disable asking such interactive questions, which most scripts should respect. Another alternative is to use Expect.
