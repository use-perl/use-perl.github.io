As <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Shlomi+Fish/journal/31651">promised</a>, I
wrote and released 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-Sprintf-Named/">Text-Sprintf-Named</a> 
onto the CPAN. This is an implementation of a Python-like sprintf with named
conversions. So you can do 
<tt>my $formatter = Text::Sprintf::Named-&gt;new({fmt =&gt; 'Hello %(name)s! You have $%(money)04d in your bank account!');</tt> 
and then 
<tt>$formatter-&gt;format({args =&gt; {name =&gt; "Joey", money =&gt; 350}})</tt>
and get 'Hello Joey! You have $0350 in your bank account!' in return.
</p>

<p>
Now that I look at its POD again I see that the code in the synopsis is wrong. 
I guess I'll have to release version 0.01001 soonishly. If you find
this module useful, that's good, and if not, I hope I haven't made your
situation any worse. I wrote it because I thought it may prove useful for 
a Test::Run plugin, so necessity was the mother of implementation in this
case.
</p>

<p>
Cheers all, and a Happy Thanksgiving to all Americans.

<h2>Text vs. String</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2006-11-23T20:29:10</h3>
I see, by the acknowledgements in your docs, that you've seen my module, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?String::Sprintf" title="cpan.org">String::Sprintf</a cpan.org>. I'm wondering why you chose the name <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Text::Sprintf::Named" title="cpan.org">Text::Sprintf::Named </a cpan.org> instead of String::Sprintf::Named... Not that I think you're wrong, I'm just wondering. A bit of consistency among module authors would be nice. And I'm wondering what other people prefer...?<br><br>BTW I got my choice for "String" from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?String::Format" title="cpan.org">String::Format</a cpan.org>.<br><br>Oh yeah: I'm planning to support numerically indexed parameters, like <code>%2$.3fs</code> to format the second parameter (the part before the "$") as a float with 3 decimals.

<p>
When I first came up with the idea of having a sprintf with named conversions, I wanted to call the module <tt>Text-Sprintf-Named</tt>. That was before I learned about your efforts, and when I implemented it, I followed my initial mental inertia.

<p>
To <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/21259" title="perl.org">quote Larry Wall</a perl.org>: "The problem with being consistent is that there are lots of ways to be consistent, and they're all inconsistent with each other.". Seriously now, Text::Sprintf::Named can optionally make use of String::Sprintf or any other customised sprintf by over-riding its <tt>_sprintf</tt> method. Note that at the moment every conversion is rendered separately, but I'd like to fix this problem sometime.

<p>
Indeed. This is one reason I believe <tt>String-Sprintf</tt> is not a good enough name for the module you wrote, because there may be other <tt>String-Sprintf-*</tt> modules, with different takes on an enhanced sprintf-like functionality. I used <tt>*-Sprintf-Named</tt>
to indicate something on the enhancement I intended the module to have.

<p>
Like I said in my previous reply upthread, it should be doable.
