I was given at work an assignment to convert all the PHP in a certain PHP 
and Flash 8 application to Perl. So I started doing it using CGI::Application
and a bootload of Perl modules I was familiar with or heard of. (a lot of them
in core).
</p>

<p>
I've been trying to maintain as much compatibility with the PHP application
as I can. (Due to the fact I'm not sure I can modify the Flash application
effectively.) Next, I'll need to work on Windows and Linux simultaneously
because Flash 8 only runs on Windows (*grunt*), and I'd rather run Perl
, PHP and Apache on Linux. 
</p>

<p>
For this end, I can either use a VNC viewer on any Windows XP machine, or
remote desktop to a Windows machine. Only problem is that Windows XP Home does 
not support Remote Desktop, and Windows XP Professional allows only one user
at a time to work on the machine (remotely or locally). So I'm a bit limited.
(Did I already mention that I hate Microsoft and am beginning to hate 
Adobe for not releasing Flash 8 for Linux?)
</p>

<p>
Right now, I got stuck a little on trying to find a Perl equivalent for
<a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.imagefilter.php">some of the PHP 
    imageiflter()'s</a>. I'm using the GD module, but could not find anything
there. So I'm planning to roll my own routines using XS, and hope that my
work will allow me to submit them to CPAN as open source. (I don't see why
not, but I'll ask anyway.)
</p>

<p>
In order to make sure I'm starting with a working app, and gradually testing
the Perl parts, I'm going to use some Apache games to pass stuff to the PHP
scripts or the Perl app. Fun, fun, fun. 
</p>

<p>
PHP, Perl, Apache, GD, XS, Flash 8, Windows, Linux, VNC, Rdesktop - it sure 
may seem like an easy task, but isn't. In any case, cheers!
</p>

<h2>Tried Imager?</h2>

Have you considered <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Imager/" title="cpan.org">Imager</a cpan.org>?
  It rocks!  I'm not suggesting it supports all the php image filter effects, but patching Imager may be easier than start wih XS from scratch.

<p>
I'm already using the GD module, which is an interface to libgd, which is also what the PHP code is using. I'm planning on implementing the missing functions in the GD module, which isn't a lot.
