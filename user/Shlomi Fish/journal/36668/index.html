<p><p>
One of my many computerised passions is to collect quotes in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)">UNIX-like
fortune format</a>. Throughout the years, I have formed 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">a moderately large 
collection of them</a> in several files. As time went on, I noticed a few
problems. First of all, they were all in large plaintext files, and pointing
someone to a quote involved giving a link to the fortune, and saying 
"search for Foobar". Moreover, since they were just chunks of text, they
couldn't hold any meta-data.
</p>

<p>
At one time, I heard of someone who created an XML grammar to describe Unix
fortunes, but a Google search was no help in finding that. And I also have
the grand <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/ideas/fortunes-mania/">"Fortunes 
Mania"</a> vision for a community site that for collecting and sorting 
quotes. This vision was very intimidating, but recently, I decided to take
a small baby step by defining a grammar for fortunes as XMLs. So I present
to you the <a href="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/web-cpan/XML-Grammar-Fortune/">XML-Grammar-Fortune</a> distribution.
</p>

<p>
I've taken quite a lot of time to think about what I wanted there. One
thing I concluded was that there are several different types of
fortune cookies: run-of-the-mill quotes, IRC conversations, excerpts
from screenplays, structured plaintext, HTML, etc. Therefore, the XML grammar 
should be able to have several different types of sub-nodes, which each
corresponds to a certain class of fortune cookies
</p>

<p>
Until now I've used <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Definition">DTDs</a> for
defining my XML schemas, but for XML-Grammar-Fortune, I decided to learn
<a href="http://relaxng.org/">Relax NG</a>, which I was told was easier
than the W3C XML Schemas. I was very impressed from Relax NG - it's easy,
it's fun, and it's powerful. One problem I've encountered was that, when
validating a document using it, XML::LibXML (version
<tt>perl-XML-LibXML-1.66-1mdv2008.1</tt>), does not give the line number
where the validation error has occured. To overcome such problems, one needs
to look at the diffs or bisect the document.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I defined a 
<a href="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/web-cpan/XML-Grammar-Fortune/trunk/XML-Grammar-Fortune/module/extradata/fortune-xml.rng">Relax
NG Schema for the documents</a>, and made sure that some basic examples will
validate (test-driven-development-style). Then I worked on 
<a href="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/web-cpan/XML-Grammar-Fortune/trunk/XML-Grammar-Fortune/module/extradata/fortune-xml-to-html.xslt">an XSLT 
stylesheet to convert them to XHTML</a>.
</p>

<p>
When I started, I only had one fortune type - <tt>&lt;raw&gt;</tt>, which
is a gigantic <tt>&lt;pre&gt;</tt> block with some meta-data. I gradually
implemented more fortune types: <tt>irc</tt>, <tt>quote</tt>
and <tt>screenplay</tt>, whose RNG and XSLT were based on 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Grammar-Screenplay/">XML-Grammar-Screenplay</a>,
with a lot of ugly copying-and-pasting.
</p>

<p>
I gradually converted more and more fortunes to have a richer XML semantics.
The XML grammar requires an id for each fortune, and also allows specifying
a title-element, and some fields in the <tt>&lt;info&gt;</tt> tag, like
"author" or "work". For example 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/friends.html">all 
the "Friends" fortunes</a> were converted to XML by first normalising the
screenplay and then using a script I wrote to convert them to XML.
</p>

<p>
So I had all the fortunes as XMLs, but now the plaintext versions went
out of sync. So I coded 
<a href="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/web-cpan/XML-Grammar-Fortune/trunk/XML-Grammar-Fortune/module/lib/XML/Grammar/Fortune/ToText.pm">a 
Perl module to convert them from XML to plaintext</a>.
</p>

<p>
I should note that due to 
<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=35781">a 
problem with XML-LibXSLT and perl-5.10.0</a>, I didn't upload it to CPAN
yet, because I do not want to receive so many failure reports.
</p>

<p>
On a different note: my former co-worker has read 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Newbies/">"Perl 
for Perl Newbies"</a> in order to learn Perl, liked it a lot, and told me I
should add more to it. That also feels good.
