<h1>Creating Mandriva Packages for XML::Feed</h1>

<p><p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandriva_Linux">Mandriva Linux</a> is
the new name of the Linux distribution formerly known as "Mandrake", and is my
distribution of choice. I'm using it as a desktop both at home, and at work. 
</p>

<p>
For a long time, I've been an <a href="http://www.rpm.org/">RPM</a> hacker and 
tinkered with RPMs: fixing problems, creating new ones, or updating them. Now,
however, I decided to take a more active role within Mandriva and become a
first-class packager. I was referred 
<a href="http://wiki.mandriva.com/Development/Howto/Submitter">to 
this resource</a> on the Mandriva wiki, and realised that before I ask for
the packager bit, I should upload some packages.
</p>

<p>
Now, since I've lately been playing 
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Shlomi+Fish/journal/32478">with Plagger</a>,
I decided to get some of its dependencies into Mandriva. Starting with 
XML::Feed, I created packages for its Perl modules suitable for inclusion into
Mandriva. I did not use cpan2rpm, 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Ovid/">Ovid</a> (the CPAN Module not 
Curtis "Ovid" Poe) or friends, but rather started from an existing RPM .spec
file and tweaked it.
</p>

<p>
One thing I realised was that I shouldn't have tweaked an XS-enabled module's
.spec into a pure-Perl one, because there are several fundamental differences
in the packaging. I ended up fixing some modules I prepared, one after the
other.
</p>

<p>
As it turned out, XML-Feed did not have too many dependencies that were not 
already present in the Mandriva pool of packages. Now, I should probably work
on the rest of Plagger. (If I disappear for a few weeks, you know I'll be
buried in hacking on RPM .specs).
</p>

<p>
The packages are available in 
<a href="ftp://ftp.mandriva.com/incoming/cooker/">the incoming directory</a>
but as far as I know were not included in the pool yet.
</p>
