<p><p>
After going over some of the recent and not-so-recent 
<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=XML-RSS">XML::RSS 
bugs</a>, I noticed a common pattern of people wanting support for replicable
XML elements. What they wanted was that when two elements with identical
names were specified (in many RSS use cases where doing this would make
sense), then the value pointed by the keyname would become a reference
to an array instead of just concatenated together in an unhelpful manner.
</p>

<p>
In the past days, I decided to work on this meta-problem in one concentrated
swoop. I naturally had to implement it in several places for both output and 
parsing, though tended to do them in separate commits.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-RSS/">XML-RSS</a> version 1.40
contains the result of this effort. I should note that some use-cases for
multiple tags probably won't do the right thing, and the internal code
has garnered some ugliness. I ended up extracting some methods, but I can still
be happier from the quality of code. I suppose I can always refactor it later.
</p>

<p>
All of this work reduced the number of active bugs in XML-RSS to 3, which
I intend to deal with shortly, if all goes well.
</p>

<p>
In other news, I released a new version of 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-Search-MSN/">WWW::Search::MSN</a>,
which has been adapted to the new HTML generated by the MSN search. The
hardest part in the process, was figuring out how to instruct the libwww-perl
that the WWW::Search front-end used to send a "Language:" header to cancel
the location-based localisation.
</p>

<p>
That was my boring "recent hacktivity" report. You may now go on with whatever
you did earlier.
