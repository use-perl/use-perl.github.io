Here is another cool use for Perl: pre-processing the HTML/JS/CSS markup of
poorly-written sites before it reaches the web browser. In this post, I'll
tell the story of how I ended up writing the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/yjobs-on-mozilla/">yjobs-proxy
markup-transforming proxy</a> using CPAN's 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTTP-Proxy/">HTTP-Proxy</a> to make
www.yjobs.co.il work with Firefox on my Linux system.
</p>

<p>
It all started when I was job-hunting, and was dismayed to discover
that there were much fewer Info-Tech job ads in the newspaper's "Wanted Ads"
section than there used to be. The section proudly announced that now it has
an Internet counterpart - 
<a href="http://www.yjobs.co.il/">www.yjobs.co.il</a>. But much to my
disappointment, it didn't work in my Linux-based, open-source browsers.
</p>

<p>
I almost immediately thought of writing a 
<a href="http://www.greasespot.net/">Greasemonkey</a> script to whip the
JavaScript code there into a shape where it can work with Firefox. Eventually,
I started writing it, and looked for a way to inject new declarations of
JavaScript functions into the page, to replace the existing and broken 
ones. <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/greasemonkey-users/browse_frm/thread/9b6c33e3e3cf5bbd/6d9cd1a4fa556ca6?lnk=gst&amp;q=shlomi+fish#6d9cd1a4fa556ca6">I
found a way to do that</a>, but it turned out to have some limitations due
to the architecture of Greasemonkey and the way it interacts with the page.
</p>

<p>
After thinking about it for a moment, I realised I could achieve the same
thing by transforming the code that Firefox receives from the site into
a more agreeable version. So I thought of a transforming proxy. Someone here
on use.perl.org mentioned HTTP::Proxy in one of his posts, so I went to check
it out and see if it can solve my problems.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, I was distracted and delayed a bit by
investigating <a href="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13750">this
X Server bug</a>. But then I resumed to work on the proxy. HTTP-Proxy turned
out to be a great way to implement what I had in mind, but I still ran into
a few problems. (Which weren't HTTP-Proxy's fault.).
</p>

<p>
The first one from what I recall was that it refused to filter JavaScript code.
As it turned out yjobs sent the "Content-Type:" of the JavaScript code either
as "application/x-javascript" or an undefined one, while I used 
"text/javascript". I ended up filtering them by the <tt>.js</tt> extension in
the path, and by specifying a mime filter of "undef".
</p>

<p>
Then I ran into a problem where a variable called "Data" was assigned
to, but not used anywhere else. As it turned out, my logging proxy, which I
used to dump all the traffic, did not log the particular script where it was
made use of. Maybe Firefox cached it. After that, I found out where it was
used and used the Venkman JavaScript debugger to the problem I had getting
it displayed on the page. It was fixed using a JavaScript transformation
specific to that particular script. 
</p>

<p>
Another problem I encountered was an original function was called despite
the fact I overrided it in the bottom. As it turned out, this was caused
because it was invoked before the JS interpreter reached the 
definition at the end. Like this code:
</p>

<code>
&lt;html&gt;<br />
&lt;body&gt;<br />
&lt;script&gt;<br />
function mytest()<br />
{<br />
    return &quot;FirstFoo&quot;;<br />
}<br />
<br />
var myvar = mytest();<br />
&lt;/script&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;h1 id=&quot;put_here&quot;&gt;Put Here&lt;/h1&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;script&gt;<br />
document.getElementById(&quot;put_here&quot;).innerHTML = myvar;<br />
&lt;/script&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;script&gt;<br />
function mytest()<br />
{<br />
    return &quot;Second&quot;;<br />
}<br />
&lt;/script&gt;<br />
&lt;/body&gt;<br />
&lt;/html&gt;<br />
</code>

<p>
This was resolved by transforming the JS code in the original function.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, I got it working enough. Then I cleaned up the proxy code, and
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/yjobs-on-mozilla/">released 
it</a> for the world's consumption.
</p>

<p>
My future plans for this proxy, is to investigate a way to implement it as
a Firefox extension that will be transform the markup from within Firefox.
</p>

<p>
A fellow Perl programmer I talked with on AIM that I pointed to the download 
page, said that "that's nucking futs, man" and then that "oh, it's cool.  I just
mean, that's pretty crazy.  A proxy to make a site work...  crazy.  and
awesome.". :-)
</p>

<p>
So this is one way Perl has given Power to the People. Hack on!
