I received several emails about the XML-RSS grant - nothing that I have a lot
to tell about. Ask has commited the rest of the changes that were present
in my repository (leading to an empty diff) and then I asked him for a commit
bit on the XML-RSS master repository. He set it up yesterday's night, but
because of several difficulties, I could only commit this morning. I really
needed this because I wanted to move files from one place to another, which
isn't handled properly by unified diffs.
</p>

<p>
Today I've not felt very well, so I stayed at home, and spent some time
working on XML::RSS. I've made 20 commits so far, which involved:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Moving the files from under <tt>examples</tt> to under <tt>t/data</tt>.
</li>
<li>
Some other build system tweaks.
</li>
<li>
Made all files that were left executable in the repository non-executable
as there's no reason for them to be so.
</li>
<li>
Added better test coverage, according to the input of 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-Cover/">Devel::Cover</a>.
</li>
<li>
While I was in the neigbourhood, I also fixed some bugs and made some of the
code more correct.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
All the changes are at the moment 
<a href="http://svn.perl.org/modules/XML-RSS/trunk/">in the trunk</a>. Thus,
my work after receiving the grant is off to a start. Friday and Saturday are
the weekend in Israel, so hopefully I can get even more work done. Happy
RSSing!
