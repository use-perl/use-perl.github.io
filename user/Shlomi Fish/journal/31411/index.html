<h1>XML::RSS Meta Bug</h1>

<p><p>
So I continued working on XML::RSS. Then I encountered 
<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=11415">this 
    bug</a>. Essentially it complains about the fact that one cannot put "0"
as the value of many elements. This was caused by statements such as
<tt>if ($self-&gt;{channel}-&gt;{title})</tt> that rejected the values "0",
the empty string, etc. The attached patch converted it to <tt>ne ''</tt>,
but that was not a good solution because it would accept <tt>undef</tt>,
and reject the empty string. Plus, the patch did not contain a test suite.
</p>

<p>
So I had to go over all the places in the code and write a patch that will
add suitable test cases, and then fix the problem. One problem I encountered
was that the default values of the fields were initialised as the empty string,
which was accepted by <tt>if (defined(...))</tt> and I had to convert them
to undef (one by one).
</p>

<p>
So, 61 SVK commits, 88 individual tests, 1390 lines of the test file, and 4
days later, I fixed all these cases, and submitted 
<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Attachment/255121/110275/XML-RSS-11415-rev3.patch">a 
    patch</a>. Working on it proved to be fun in a braindead kind of way.
I kept feeling that I want to work on it, like I was addicted to some bad
drug. But now it's over.
</p>

<p>
On the plus side, I was able to refactor some of the XML::RSS code in the 
process, and also found a way to create Test::Run targets into a 
Makefile.PL+
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Manifest/">Test::Manifest</a> setup.
</p>

<p>
In other news:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Someone reported that he could not install Error.pm using CPAN.pm. Turns out 
he had Module::Build as the default and ran into 
<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=22534">this bug</a>, which
I reproduced, isolated and reported.
</li>
<li>
Trying to subscribe to the XML-RSS Request Tracker traffic caused me to 
<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.module-authors/4874">run into
a strange rt.cpan.org bug</a>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
And with this hopeful tone - good bye, and happy hacking.
</p>

<h2>Common bug</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nik/">nik</a> on 2006-10-25T11:46:05</h3>
That's a common bug.  I recently ran in to the same thing in Text::Diff::Parser (<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=22284" title="cpan.org">22284</a cpan.org>)
