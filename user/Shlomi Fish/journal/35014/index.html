<h1>A Blast from the Past - perl-5.005</h1>

<p><p>
After uploading Error-0.17010, I received several installation failures from
testers who tested using perl-5.005. I wanted to simply deprecate perl-5.005,
but I talked with my co-maintainer to see what he thinks about it. From what
I understood, he wanted me to fix the problems that caused the failures on
perl-5.005 and then to upload it again to see if it helps.
</p>

<p>
I didn't want to upload something without making sure the tests pass, because
otherwise it will take a while to get it working. So I decided to install 
perl-5.005.
</p>

<p>
After downloading perl-5.005, the first thing I noticed was that running "make"
failed immediately. This was due to a gcc-4.2 regression which can be fixed 
using
<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2006/11/msg117739.html">this fix</a>. Apparently it also affects more recent versions of perl5.
</p>

<p>
After applying the fix, everything compiled, and "make test" passed.
</p>

<p>
Error.pm requires Scalar::Util so I had to build it. As it turns out 
"perl5.005 Makefile.PL" does not work there properly for some reason,
while "perl5.005 -d Makefile.PL" (and then "c" in the debugger) works fine.
</p>

<p>
Retrospectively I learned that it requires an up-to-date Test::Harness.
</p>

<p>
Error.pm also made use of the warnings module so I need to install 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/warnings-compat/">warnings-compat</a>. This
in turn required Test-More, which is part of the Test-Simple distribution.
This in turn required Test-Harness so I had to install Test-Harness-2.64, whose
building worked. Then I backtracked until I had everything installed.
</p>

<p>
Now to Error.pm. I changed an <tt>open I, "&gt;", "Changes"</tt> 
to <tt>open I, "&gt;Changes"</tt>. However, it still didn't work. There's
one bug in the script <tt>05text-errors-with-file-handles.t</tt> which
works fine in perl-5.8.8. There were also failures in a script that my
co-maintainer originally wrote, which I didn't understand.
</p>

<p>
So after all this work, I gave up. I told the co-maintainer that if he wanted
to have Error working with perl-5.005, he should do the work himself. 
Otherwise, I'll just bump the minimum version to perl-5.6.x.
</p>

<p>
Triaging Error.pm with perl-5.005 made me realise how much the more modern
perls are better to work with. I pity the people who still have to work with
such old versions of perl.
</p>

<h2>You are using warnings?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2007-12-18T11:50:03</h3>
You should run Perl::MinimumVersion over that code, you shouldn't ever "use warnings" on anything that you want to be 5.005 compatible.<br><br>Just put $^W = 1; in your test scripts to make sure warnings are on during tests.
