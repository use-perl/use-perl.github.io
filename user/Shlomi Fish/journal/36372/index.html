Well, Per <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/brian_d_foy/journal/36356">brian 
d foy's blog post</a>, I'd like to answer the question "Why I'm Passionate
About Perl". First of all, I should note my 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/perl/joy-of-perl/">"The 
Joy of Perl"</a> 
essay, which I wrote back in 2004. It gave a lot of good reasons why
I like Perl so much and am still passionate about it. But now to answer brian's
questions:
</p>

<p>
<b>The person who introduced me to Perl showed me that...</b> - I still
remember him (Ran) telling me that one can write a TCP/IP client in 4 lines, and
a TCP/IP server in 10 lines. (Or something like that). I ended up not
understanding what regular expressions were all about and he explained that
they matched patterns in texts. Back then, I had to learn perl 5 from
perl*.pod (what are now the perldocs). 
</p>

<p>
<b>I first started using Perl to...</b> -  had to learn Perl (and Unix) 
because I wanted the job working for Ran's company. I liked both Perl and Unix
so much that I understood why I had not been content with all the technologies
I encountered previously. (DOS and Windows 3.11). 
</p>

<p>
<b>I kept using Perl because...</b> that was what I knew and I was comfortable
writing it, and found that most various techniques were readily available
in some form or another. For example, after reading 
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a> I was able to easily
implement the closure-based techniques shown there in Perl. Then after I
learned Object-Oriented Programming in Perl, I found out how nice it was,
and how much better it was than C++. (Which if you ask me now supports 
Object-Oriented Programming roughly as much as COBOL supports Functional
Programming.)
</p>

<p>
I later on learned how to effectively use the CPAN, use accessors, and many
other tricks and techniques. I got involved in the Local and International
Perl community, which was also a lot of fun. 
</p>

<p>
I'm not a Perl fanatic and see myself sometimes using, learning or
experimenting with other technologies. But I still like Perl 5 the most.
</p>

<p>
<b>I can't stop thinking about Perl...</b> - actually I often can. The amount
of time I spend coding is small, and Perl is even less than that.
</p>

<p>
<b>I get other people to use Perl by</b> quietly telling them how Perl is
important and how it is enlightening and useful, and also telling them about
the things I'm doing with Perl.
</p>

<p>
<b>I also program in</b> Bash, C/C++, PHP and a little Python (and small 
experimental stuff in many other languages) <b>but I like Perl better
since</b>: 1. It's a real, and safe programming language unlike Bash. 
2. It's much more easier to write than C, C++ or Bash. 3. It's more
comfortable to me than Python due to the TMTOWTDY, use strict
and other factors. (Though I can understand why Python has its appeal
to some people.) 4. It's much less hacky than Bash and PHP. 5. The Perl
community is great, and has a very healthy attitude.
</p>

<p>
Note that I'm still using bash for the command line and for some really
minimal scripts, and am happy with it, and prefer it over Perl.
</p>

<p>
Comments are welcome. (I leave the comments open, as I almost always do).
