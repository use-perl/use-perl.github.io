<p><p>
Hi! This is the first time I make use of my "use Perl" web-log. I'm doing it 
in order to raise an issue I encountered with the Perl IRC world. If you 
participate in IRC discussions in Perl-related channels, please help spread
the word, or if you are knowledgeable enough comment below or 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/me/contact-me/">contact me</a>.
</a>
</p>
<p>
My IRC reputation in the Perl-related channels has become tarnished lately, I
don't know exactly why, and I'd like to get to the bottom of it. The first time
I encountered it was on January 22 this year. I logged in to irc.perl.org and
joined #perl in order to look for Mark Fowler (of the Perl Advent Calendar).
There someone named sungo said "rindolf: [that's my nick] are you who i think
you are.", and shortly afterward banned me from the channel. I tried to talk
with him, (using a dedicated /msg talk channel), but he told me that he doesn't
want to explain his actions to me, and that I shouldn't /msg him.
</p>
<p>
Two days ago, I joined irc.perl.org again, and wanted to ask a question in 
#perl. (about CPAN smoking). The ban was still there. So I joined #poe and 
asked if the ban could be lifted. Eventually it was, and I was able to get
the help I needed and then just stayed there without doing anything. When 
sungo logged on a few hours later, and noticed I was there, he banned me again.
</p>
<p>
Now today, I logged into FreeNode's #perl, and Jonathan Scott Duff (a.k.a 
PerlJam), told me:
</p>
<p>
<i>"For the past several days now your name has come up on the other #perls 
    quite a bit  (usually in phrases like "If that rindolf guy shows up, I'll 
    kick+ban him!" or "make sure rindolf is banned" etc.)  What did you do 
    that's got people up in arms against you again?"</i>
</p>
<p>
And I honestly don't know. In the last days, I've hanged out mostly in 
FreeNode, Moznet, and GimpNet, (with a couple of logins to irc.perl.org and to
OFTC). I did not mis-behave, and was not impolite or a troll. What caused 
that?
</p>
<p>
I realize I wrote some essays in the past that evoked antagonism from some 
parts of the Perl community. However that was quite a long time ago (the
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/1339/">Critique of Perl 6</a> was
published 6 months ago), and I did not brought them into discussions in the 
IRC unless I was asked about them first. I also contributed some code, 
documentation and help to perl, and open-source in general, so my karma cannot
be entirely negative.
</p>
<p>
Can anyone bring any evidence as to why I am mistreated this way, with no
fault of my own? Something is fishy here.
</p>

</p>

<em>I don't think expressing crazy ideas in a crazy manner, should bring irrational IRC bans.</em> <br> <br>I agree entirely.  But you're talking about sungo here, so reason is irrelevant.<br> <br> <em>Is the Perl community such that rejects people who think differently than the rest, and express their different opinions?</em> <br> <br>If by "reject" you mean "ban," you're referring to the actions of one person, not the Perl community; as the question presumes a state which does not exist, no answer is possible, except for the perhaps unfulfilling "no."<br> <br> <em>Then what business does he have being an IRC operator?</em> <br> <br>Are you new to IRC?  Being +o is not based on merit, it's based on popularity and politics and machine ownership and other such things.<br>

Well, first I apologize for generalizing to the Perl community. And then - regarding sungo - ok I understand now. But it doesn't explain how it propagated to other #perl's in other networks, just because sungo banned me (and noone knew about it).

You're ignoring the issues here, and focusing on sungo and IRC.
<p>
Your real problem is that you don't listen to what people say, and are not interested in conversing with anyone.  You're an output-only data stream.

</p><p>
You disagree with the way some things are in Perl 5, so you start waving a flag about how you're going to fork Perl into a new language named after yourself.
</p><p>
You come in and say "The Camel Book should be given away!" and people explain why that won't happen, and that's not good enough for you.
</p><p>
You say things like Perl 6 sucks, and gripe and complain, and then do nothing about it.
</p><p>People have explained this to you in this very thread, and you ignore what people have said and latch on to "sungo's a meanie!"

</p><p>
<b>Open up your ears.</b>
</p><p>
<b>Do something more than gripe.</b>
</p><p>
<b>LISTEN.</b></p>

Be careful with that "Perl community". It's not just IRC (or use.perl, or whatever).  It's not as if we all agree on everything, or anything. Pudge, for instance, is a fascist republican gun-lover who likes the Red Sox, and I'm not. Still, he lets me post on use.perl.

Crazy ideas are fine
<p>
I've read some of shlomi fish's essays about why perl sucks so badly.
</p><p>
No wonder few people welcome him. I doubt I'd be welcome at a meeting of pro-software patent laywers and MEP's right now. But I don't expect them to like or welcome me.
</p><p>
Of course when I bitched about them it was based on informed opinion and what I have seen in practice and I got of my arse and did something useful (lobby my politicians join and contribute to ffii mailing list debates and correspondance with the UKPO)
</p><p>
Shlomi - perhaps you could take back the many insults and rants you have made and apologise before you whine and whinge some more.

<p>
Well, I revised some of my original opinions (or at least the impressions they commonly left from the "Usability of the Perl World to Newcomers" essay <a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/perl-att-newbies/year-after/perl-att-newbies-year-later.html" title="berlios.de">in the year and some later conclusion</a berlios.de>. As for the Perl 6 Critique - it was not directed at anyone personally, but rather at the Perl 6-related activity, which I predicted to accomplish little good. I realize I may have stepped on the nerves of some people, but this was my opinion and I still stand by it.
</p>
<p>
If I have ever offended anyone unjustly (in regards to Perl or otherwise) - I apologize.
</p>
<p>
P.S: none of my essays say that Perl "sucks so badly". In fact, <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.advocacy/2108" title="perl.org">one of my essays says precisely the opposite</a perl.org>. My essays instead criticized several undesirable aspects of the Perl world, and gave better alternatives.
</p>
<p>
However, I think we are missing the point. What difference does it make what opinions I expressed as long as my IRC behaviour is perfectly acceptable, and I don't step on anyone nerves on the IRC?

"If you want to talk to Mark Fowler, you could have simply gotten his contact information from"
</p>
<p>
Mark Fowler's <a href="http://2shortplanks.com/contact/" title="2shortplanks.com">contact information</a 2shortplanks.com> says he has an E-mail address, and also can be reached by IRC on irc.perl.org and more rarely on AIM. The issue was that I wrote several E-mails to him for which I did not receive a reply, and wanted to find out if he received them and what he thought about them. So I needed to find an interactive way to talk to him, and IRC was my best choice.

People usually answer my E-mails - that's not the problem. Fowler had a good reason for not answering my E-mails, and I was able to talk to him on IRC a couple of times, and get updated. That's not a problem either.

<h2>A brief history of #perl and why you were banned</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/schwern/">schwern</a> on 2005-04-06T20:44:31</h3>
<p>To understand irc.perl.org and #perl (THE #perl not just A #perl) you must know something of the history of #perl.

</p><p>#perl started out on EFNet, at the time the largest, most popular, most unregulated IRC network with over 40,000 users on at any time.  #perl was very popular.  There were regulars.  There were folks who strolled in asking questions.  Some of them were interesting questions, some of them were FAQs.  Some were grateful, some were dicks, some were whiners.  The regulars got sick of answering the FAQs (this is how purl was born) over and over again and started kicking people out if they didn't read and follow the topic.  This generated ill will.  #perl got attacked.  A lot.  We had a few takeover attempts a week.  We devised an elaborate botnet to defend the channel and befriended IRC ops to help us get the channel back when it was lost.

</p><p>Finally a bunch of the regulars decided it wasn't fair to hold #perl on the most popular network for their own social club, because that's what #perl is.  So we left EFNet and started our own, MagNET.  Once off EFNet we didn't have to worry about helping newbies, answering FAQs, defending against channel takeovers, maintaining the ban list... we could be a bunch of elitist, arrogant jerks talking about whatever amused us without worrying about offending someone who just happened to walk in or feeling any obligation to answer Perl questions.

</p><p>#perl remains a social club.  We like to have somewhere to go where we can hang out and not have to work.  Folks that want a more serious, technical #perl can go to any of the other popular networks... EFNet, DALnet and freenode to name three.  And they do, a lot of the #perl regulars hang out on another network as well.

</p><p>Point is, #perl is not "the Perl community" its our little social club that's tried to isolate itself (I'm not sure adding irc.perl.org to MagNET was such a hot idea).  We answer Perl questions when we feel like it.  Its not a nice place.  Whether you think that's a good idea or not, too bad!  We run the network on our machines.  You've got aaaaaall those other public networks to find acceptance in.

</p><p>As to why you were banned... well, part of it is just sungo, and he runs the machines.  I would have waited until you shoved your foot in your mouth again, but I don't entirely disagree with it.  Let's call it a preemptive ban based on past behavior.  Your ideas are arrogant, ignorant and you don't appear to learn from your mistakes.  And worst of all you don't produce anywhere near the amount of perl patches to match the amount of dust you kick up.  Signal-to-noise ratio very low.  You've dug your hole and saying "Oh, the last moronic thing I said was six months ago" ain't gonna get you very far.

</p><p> <a href="http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/1339/" title="freshmeat.net">Critique of Where Perl 6 is Heading</a freshmeat.net>

</p><p>We just don't want to hear about it.  And we know that, or something like it, is going to come up.  You've established a pattern.  So we banned you.  And we can do that, because its our own little corner of the Internet.  #perl's corner, not Perl's.  If you want fair and rational there's #perl on EFNet, DALnet and freenode.

</p><p>And that's why you were banned.</p>

16:31 &lt; purl&gt; shlomi has karma of -20</code> </div></blockquote>Thought the record should be set straight there, and that might help you understand a bit more....

Schlomi, don't you have a mother or someone who could explain why it was a really dumb idea to post that whine? I mean, these boys have few social skills but you make even Uri and Randal look almost mature. Not to beat on you, but son, you're old enough to know better. No, I am not going to be the one to explain it to you. What were you expecting from a community with a long, long history of assholes and whiners? Helpful, nice people are rare.
</p>
<p>
As for the rest of you dumb assholes, some things just never change do they? Years pass, you marry, you get that house in the suburbs and you have kids and yet, online you still behave like the dumb little boys who found someone to kick and will do so at every available opportunity. And it's not just IRC. Even dogs are smarter since they will either kill it or ignore it.
</p>
<p>
And still you wonder why women don't bother hanging around.

<p>By using my vast powers of english-language parsing, I determine that in fact she *didn't* call the opers dogs.</p>
<p>She called them dumber than dogs</p>

Yes. I find a lot less time for anything perl related anymore. For some reason, after all these years and investment of time, I still piss my time away being the one of the few who will at least say something in the midst of a school shooting on the short bus as a pointless exercise. Clearly, I haven't changed enough.
