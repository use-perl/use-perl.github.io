Well, here is an update on 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/File-Find-Object/">File-Find-Object</a>.
As it turned out the has-a network was somewhat more complicated: every
directory object contained a reference to the root object, and to the main
directory object. And like I said each one of them is-a File-Find-Object.
</p>

<p>
After a medium amount of refactoring, what happens now is that every directory
object is independant, and does not contain a link to either the main object
or the directory above it. It still, however, is-a File-Find-Object, and I 
have yet to successfully work around it.
</p>

<p>
I recall trying to do too much refactoring at once at everytime, and failed
miserably. The tests did not run from some reason. Then when I did a little
refactoring each time, I was more successful. I still think it is wrong for
the directory class (File-Find-Object-internal) to be is-a of the main class,
but when I tried to do it the other way around I failed. I guess I'd have to
find a way to refactor it bit by bit.
</p>

<p>
Next on the agenda:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Converting everything to File::Spec.
</li>
<li>
Adding more required features like pruning, customised sorting, etc.
</li>
<li>
Normalising the functions - which should be part of the API and which should
be preceded by an underscore. Add POD to everything that's part of the API.
</li>
<li>
More kwalitee improvements.
</li>
<li>
Integrating into File-Find-Rule and friends instead or in addition to
File::Find.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Hopefully I'll get do some of it tomorrow. Too little time, too many things to do.
