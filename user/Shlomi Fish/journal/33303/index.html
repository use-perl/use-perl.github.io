<div class="span8">

<b>Note:</b> I clarified the text a bit due to the input.
</p>

<p>
So I wanted to submit a small patch to Parrot. Where do I start? Possibly
<a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/">its Bug Tracker</a>. However, there isn't
any link there on how to post bugs. None whatsoever. Not even a link to an
explanation. None.
</p>

<p>
So I had to ask the #parrot channel. They referred me to 
<a href="http://www.parrotcode.org/docs/submissions.html">this document</a>.
After reading it, it said to prepare the patch, and send it to 
"parrotbug at parrotcode dot org" (a spam-obfuscated email "address" of 
<a href="mailto:parrotbug@parrotcode.org">parrotbug@parrotcode.org,
which is the address for sending patches to parrot</a>).
However, since I could not press the link in my browser to invoke the email
client (or right-click+copied it), I had to type it from memory. So I typed
it as parrotbug@parrot.org which is the incorrect address. I received a
bounce which I didn't notice, and naturally the mail did not arrive there.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, after the patch recipient complained that the email did not
arrive, I sent it again (using my mailer's "Send Again" feature) while CCing her. She received the email with the patch, but the patch was still not registered in the issue tracker, because it was  still sent to the wrong address.
</p>

<p>
I see several usability problems here:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
The bug tracker, which is where people expect to be able to submit bugs
doesn't have a link to submit them, or at least explaining how to.
</li>
<li>
The email address is spam-obfuscated, and so people mistake it for something else.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
I hope both these issues will be corrected.
</p>

It sounds like you can't do things correctly, so you like to blame your problems on other people. You made a typo and got a bounce message which you ignored. Apparently you then forgot to include the patch with the next email.<br><br>Still, you blame every one else.

<h3><a href="/user/Shlomi Fish/">Shlomi Fish</a> on 2007-05-18T16:50:03</h3>
<p>
For the record, I included the patch in that message. It's just that I still sent it again to the same address believing it was correct.
</p>

<p>
And for the record, if I could not get something right, and had to consult people, and then the admins on something (and I'm very intelligent and computer savvy) then the blame is on the system. It's bad usabilty as I demonstrated.
</p>

<p>
If I designed a program, and someone had a problem using it, and he asked me what to do, then I should first explain him how to do it, and then restructure the program in a way that will eliminate future people not finding their way around the program. Likewise for a web-site or any other computerised system. It should not make you ask questions.
</p>

<p>

<p>
So please don't throw the old "You're an idiot." card. If someone intelligent has a problem using a system someone else designed, then the blame is usually on the implementor.

Actually, Norman Walsh talks about that in <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/books-recommends/#design_of_everyday_things" title="shlomifish.org">"The Design of Everyday Things"</a shlomifish.org>. He shows how some everyday objects have serious usability problems, and the signs of them don't help at that. So these doors are badly designed.
</p>

<p>
I demonstrated two easily fixed things in which the parrot bug and patch submission process got it wrong:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
There wasn't a way to submit bugs from the bug tracker, not even a referral to a document that explains how. Yet, people expect it to be there, because that's normally the way to do it.
</p>
<p>
So I had to ask the people on #parrot (twice) and they referred me to the document. But any such request ticket should also be fixed by permanently fixing the problem, as <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html" title="joelonsoftware.com">Joel says</a joelonsoftware.com>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The Parrot help page had the address, and a non-trivial one in obfuscated text, as people can mistake it with parrotbugs@<b>parrot.org</b> or whatever, instead of the more convenient click on a mailto: link.
</p>
</li>

<li><p>
It will save a lot of time of the developers and webmasters into the future to fix these problems once and for all.
</p></li></ol>

<p>Completely wrong.  See <a href="http://bugs6.perl.org/" title="perl.org">bugs6.perl.org</a perl.org> as well as <a href="http://rt.perl.org/" title="perl.org">rt.perl.org</a perl.org>.  You said that you visited the latter.</p>

<p>I'm still waiting for an explanation as to how people have the magic knowledge of the URL of the Parrot bug tracker such that they can type it from institutional memory without error without having to use a search engine or ask someone, yet are completely incapable of copying and pasting an e-mail address.</p>

<p>Somehow, you visited the wrong page and didn't see the directions posted prominently elsewhere on every entry point we can reasonably expect a novice to see.  You made a bad assumption based on knowledge we don't reasonably expect users to have, and hide that bad assumption and the resulting mistakes behind a veneer of logic errors while waving the flag of bad usability.</p>

<p>You screwed up.  That's okay.  Everyone does.  Yet ranting and raving isn't the way to get what you want here.</p>

<p>
Let me tell you something: if you're living today and think that you're protecting your addresses from spam by obfuscating them, then you're really deluded. Spammers can and do:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Use web crawlers that read all addresses off web-sites.
</li>
<li>
Install malware on millions of exploited computers and periodically keep record of all the addresses in their address books or received or sent email messages.
</li>
<li>
Subscribe to mailing lists and listen to the traffic.
</li>
<li>
Etc.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
If you think you can keep an obfuscated address from the clatches of the spammers for long, you're wrong.

Just for the record, this is the "Disqualifier disqualifies based on his own fault" or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem" title="wikipedia.org">Ad-hominem</a wikipedia.org> fallacy. And I never complained that Perl developers are rude, just that some of the resources available for beginners were sub-optimal.

<p>Obfuscated e-mail addresses are like copy protection systems. They annoy the legitimate user and pose absolutely zero problems to a spammer gang. I mean, how hard is it to write s/ AT<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/@/g and see what falls out? And how much effort do I have to go through to decode the latest trick to fool the harvesters?</p>

<p>For all I know, there's a Mozilla filter that deobfuscates addresses on the fly, which means the code is out there to do this. In that light, Shlomi posting a normal e-mail address is neither here nor there.</p>

<p>Sure, there's code out there to do this. But usually (at least for me) de-obfuscated email adresses work pretty good. Since the net is full with non-obfuscated mail adresses, why should the spammers bother with the small part that is?</p>

<p>I second the thought that deobfuscating it was rude and childish, and Shlomi owes a big apology.</p>

Well, I'm used to rt.cpan.org where I have a convenient "New Bug" link at the top. And a bug tracker is the first place I'd expect to find that, because that's where every other project expects you to submit bugs.

<p>Again, how do you expect people to <em>find</em> the bug tracker?  Magic powers?  Innate knowledge?  Is it part of Joseph Campbell's monomyth, or some sort of Jungian archetype that me in my pushes-pull-doors-occasionally cluelessness have failed to integrate into my worldview?</p>

<p>Me, I think that the link to the Parrot Bugs Page on the Parrot homepage trumps knowledge mystically encoded into our DNA, because <em>not everyone in the world is Shlomi Fish</em>.</p> <p><blockquote><div><nobr> <wbr></nobr><em>... that's where every other project expects you to submit bugs.</em></div> </blockquote>

chromatic, most of the large or semi-large projects I know allow you to submit bugs using the bug tracker: <a href="http://bugs.kde.org/" title="kde.org">KDE</a kde.org>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/" title="mozilla.org">Mozilla</a mozilla.org>, <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/" title="gnome.org">GNOME</a gnome.org>, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/" title="sourceforge.net">all the Various SourceForge projects</a sourceforge.net>, <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/" title="cpan.org">CPAN</a cpan.org>. Etc. This is the default behaviour of most bug trackers, and it meets the users' expectations.
</p>

<p>
And as for my generalisation, let me invoke <a href="http://perl.net.au/wiki/Joel's_Generalisation" title="perl.net.au">Joel's Generalisation</a perl.net.au> here: if it applies to me, it applies to everybody. I'm probably not the first one to make this mistake, and I won't be the last.

<p>
When someone points a usability problem in your system, the easy-way-out is to claim he's an idiot or an exceptional user. But this is also the most costly way, that will make many people unhappy, clog your support system with a lot of constant questions, and in general doesn't scale well.

<p>Shlomi, I've actually defended you before in some forums because I think you're actually trying to be helpful. But frankly, at some point people have to consider whether the annoyance of dealing with you is worth the potential benefit of receiving your patches or other input.</p>

<p>I mean, you're bitching about having to correctly type in an email address, for fuck's sake. Think about it objectively: do you think it's worth someone's time to look at patches from someone who is unable to type in an email address? "From memory"? It is possible that the process of submitting patches should <b>not</b> be so easy that random lusers can do it? That they have to put in a little bit of effort as a kind of minimal filter?</p>

<p>My comment <em>is</em> perfectly meaningful and understandable English. The conclusion (&#8220;I had to type it from memory&#8221;) does not follow from the premise (&#8220;I could not press the link in my browser to invoke the email client (or right-click+copied it)&#8221;).

<p>This is a lesson I learned from another programmer long ago (as a fledgling console user, but the lesson applies to many other things): do not typewrite a name (such as a filename) that you see on the screen, as that is too prone to errors &#8211; either copy-paste it or use some form of completion.</p>
