After learning some Ruby on Rails from the O'Reilly-Net tutorial, I went
over the <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2005/06/02/catalyst.html">Perl.com
    Catalyst Tutorial</a>. Then I decided that I'll write an application in
it in order to learn it better.
</p>
<p>
So I began to write it. It took me two or three days and right
now I only have a record display page, an edit form and an addition form
for one of the tables. Part of it is because I'm not very familiar with
Class::DBI and other technologies Catalyst is making use of. 
Hopefully I'll become more familiar with everything as I invest more time.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, I discovered a misbehaviour in the Catalyst core: trailing slashes
in the PATH_INFO are ignored. So <tt>/myapp/path1/</tt> would be reported the
same as <tt>/myapp/path1</tt>. This may break a lot of relative URLs.
I traced the problem to a line containing 
<code>split /\//, $c-&gt;req-&gt;path</code>, which throws away components
that are empty from the end. A Patch I wrote to change it to 
<code>split /\//, $c-&gt;req-&gt;path, -1</code> <a href="http://www.loglibrary.com/show_page/view/141?Multiplier=3600&Interval=6&StartTime=1118148545">was 
    rejected</a> after I was told some people may depend on this erroneous 
behaviour.
</p>
<p>
I was instructed to write a Plugin instead, which I did. A problem I
encountered was that this call to split appeared right at the beginning of a 
much larger function. I wrote another patch, to extract a method with this,
but it was rejected because they did not want to clutter the API.
</p>
<p>
Thus, 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Catalyst-Plugin-SanitizeUrl/">Catalyst-Plugin-SanitizeUrl</a>
has to duplicate the code of the function, extract a method out of it, and 
then override this method. &lt;sigh /&gt; But it works([tm]).
</p>

<h2>contrast to CGI::Application</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/markjugg/">markjugg</a> on 2005-06-11T14:09:44</h3>
That sounds a lot of work to get going with a framework that's supposed to be easy to use.
<p>
I'm curious how find it compares to the more established <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/markstos/CGI-Application-4.0/lib/CGI/Application.pm#Existing_plug-ins" title="cpan.org">CGI::Application</a cpan.org> MVC framework.
</p> <p>
It's now about turn 5 years old and features over a dozen plugins. (disclaimer: I contribute to CGI::App).</p>

I don't know how easy to use is Catalyst supposed to be, but it's certainly quite complex and gives one a lot of functionality. Add to that the fact that I did not yet read all of the documentation, and it may indicate why it takes me so much time to get the hang of it.
</p>
<p>
I have worked with CGI::Application in the past. It may be a little stretch calling CGI::App a true MVC framework, especially considering the fact that it's not really RDBMS-aware. In any case, CGI::App is nice and all, but Catalyst gives you much more than CGI::App does.

<p>
I'm not sure when RDBMS became part of the MVC definition, but it's very easy to add database integration:</p> <blockquote> <div> <tt>package My::Class;<br>use base CGI::Application';<br>use CGI::Application::Plugin::DBI (qw/dbh dbh_config/);</tt> </div> </blockquote> <p>
If you want to use Class::DBI, you can use it normally. CGI::App doesn't need to get the middle.

What's one example?</p>

Well, Catalyst implements caching very well. It has a built-in way to map URLs to methods and parameters, and it also has a much larger number of Plugins than CGI::App has. And there's still a lot to be done in it.

<h2>You have my sympathy</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2005-06-14T08:07:21</h3>
For what it's worth, I'm on your side on this. URLs ending in a slash and those that don't, are not the same, neither to web servers, or to browsers. A framework that makes it impossible to distinguish between the two, is buggy, IMO.
Hiding behind backward compatibility to leave it like this, is wrongheaded. In my eyes.
<p>Furthermore, I think it's <em>they</em> who should provide a plugin to get back the old, buggy behaviour, after it's been fixed, for those people (if they even exist) silly enough to depend on these bugs,
and not you wanting to get it to behave correctly. Surely it must be a lot easier to do, too, as throwing away trailing slashes is easy; getting them back when they're thrown away first, isn't.</p>

<p>
Thanks for the support. I believe the solution of the Catalyst guys was that I should always use absolute URLs (such starting with a "/"). I personally don't buy that it's a good solution.
