<div class="span8">
<p><p>
This is another boring hacktivity summary, but this time mostly Perl-related
 - so I'm posting it here.
</p>

<p>
First order of business is <a 
href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/verify-code/">Games-Solitaire-Verify</a>. In
its first versions I implemented textual return values for the 
<tt>verify_and_perform_move()</tt> method. However, this makes it harder
and more error-prone to programmatically understand why exactly the verifier 
does not like your move . True to my ideals that errors that need to be
caught and processed must be objects, I converted everything to return
Exception::Class-subclasses. E::C really made my job easy and now my
main gripe with everything is that my error class names have become
unweildy. Some examples are:
</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>Games::Solitaire::Verify::Exception::Move::Src::Col::NotEnoughCards</tt></li>
<li><tt>Games::Solitaire::Verify::Exception::Move::Src::Col::NonSequence</tt>
</li>
<li><tt>Games::Solitaire::Verify::Exception::Move::Dest::Col::OnlyKingsCanFillEmpty</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>
Oh well. In any case, now that I've converted everthing to classes, I forgot
to add stringified versions of the errors (which Exception::Class supports), 
so if something breaks and is reported to the shell, it may not be very 
human-friendly. I guess it means a bit more work there.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards, I decided to work a bit on <a 
href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/modules/Test-Run/">Test-Run</a>, and after
I read its todo list, remembered that I still intended to create
some specialised 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Starter/">Module-Starter</a>
plugins for it. Then I remembered that I asked about M-S' test suite,
and found out it didn't have a comperensive one. So, I decided to
remedy this and <a 
href="http://code.google.com/p/module-starter/issues/detail?id=2">wrote
a patch to add a test script</a>. For the test script I parsed the generated
files step-by-step using a class and some test assertion methods. 
</p>

<p>
Since I had no repository access, the first versions of the patch were written 
by repeatedly running <tt>svn diff</tt> into files, but I decided I want a 
more robust version control for the local host. So I looked into svk
<a href="http://lists.bestpractical.com/pipermail/svk-users/2008-August/000312.html">but 
it had acquired a bug on my system.</a>. Then I decided to try 
<a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrForeignBranches/Subversion">bzr-svn</a>,
but it had a non-starter bug. Now since I dislike git quite a bit, I searched
for something Mercurial-based and found <a 
href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hgsvn">hgsvn</a>. This worked surprisingly
well for my purposes and I was able to version the local copy. Mercurial
seems pretty nifty so far.
</p>

<p>
The Module-Starter patch was not integrated into the repository yet.
Module-Starter has been suffering from quite a lot of neglect, and rjbs (who
performed its latest upload to the CPAN) told us on IRC he now uses a different
solution that was written by someone else and has not been made public yet.
I'd really like to see something better emerge, but I hope I won't have
to fork Module::Starter under a different name.
</p> 

<p>
I decided to stop patching it for the time being, but am getting anxious.
It makes me frustrated to have an uncommitted patch and no repository access
with which I can apply it.  
</p>

<p>
As I was working on Module-Starter I talked with the 
<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?smop">SMOP guys</a>,
and decided to try give it a spin. After checking out the source and doing
the <tt>make -f Makefile.cvs</tt>, <tt>./configure</tt>, <tt>make</tt>
dance, I ran into a few missing ".pm" files error. The first one was caused
by the lack of the rest of the pugs tree, and the later ones were easily
installable from CPAN. But then I ran into a strange error:
</p>

<pre>
../../../misc/elfish/elfX/../../STD_red/STD_red_run:93: syntax error, unexpected '>'
    whiteout = ->(s){s.gsub(/[^ \n]/,' ')};

</pre>

<p>
As it turned out, I needed Ruby-1.9.x (the development version that naturally
is not avaialable in Mandriva or other Linux distributions), and decided
that there's no way I'm installing it. This reminded me of
<a href="http://www.drivl.com/posts/view/700">Drivl.com recipe on
how to make square corners</a>, and I decided to give up on SMOP.
</p>

<p>
After all this, I also added a lot of text to 
<a href="http://cms.wikia.com/">the
CMS/Web-devel-framework/Web-design Wikia</a>, which I founded
and had neglected previously, and to
<a href="http://stexpanded.wikia.com/wiki/User:Shlomif">the
pages in the Star Trek "Expanded Wikia" which I maintain</a>, which were
a nice change in scenery from all the code I wrote.
</p>

<p>
Today I didn't do too much productive work, after having my usual 
post-productivty disorientation, and instead spent the first half of the 
day chatting on IRC (to a very interesting American linguist-wannabe), but
was also able to bike, for the first time since Saturday. Oh, and I saw 
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/">Wall-E on Sunday</a>,
which I liked. Been a while since I've been to the cinema.
