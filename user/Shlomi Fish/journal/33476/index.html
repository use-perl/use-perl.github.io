<p><p>
I
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Shlomi+Fish/journal/33293">blogged 
about XML-Grammar-Screenplay</a> here before. Right now, seeing that 
Parse::RecDescent is on the slow side, and that it's error reports are 
non-existent, I've decided that I want to write my own custom 
("Quick-and-Dirty") parser. So I <tt>svk cp</tt>'ed my main test file, that
tests the conversion of the proto-format to XML and validates the XML,
and started testing it with the custom parser.
</p>

<p>
Now, since I could not write the custom parser at once, I decided to
incrementally add more tests as I implement them. For this, I used the 
following:
</p>

<pre>
# TEST:$num_texts=6
@tests = splice(@tests, 0, 6);
</pre>

<p>
This is the first time I recall using <tt>splice()</tt> in production. I 
needed it so
the tests' counter (that makes use of 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Count/">Test-Count</a>) will
be easily capable of being synchronised with the actual number. This is
while not using something ugly like <tt>@tests = @tests[0 .. (6-1)]</tt>.
<tt>splice()</tt>'s substr()-like semantics made it ideal in this case.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I gradually added more tests and implemented them in the custom
parser. When planning it I wanted to write a parser that was
event based, with a dedicated user-land stack, and without functions calling
each other arbitrarily. However, I found it comfortable to implement it using
functions calling each other for each logical unit of the text, and it still
stayed this way. Thus, you can say it's a classic ad-hoc Recursive-Descent
parser, although a non-backtracking one.
</p>

<p>
One of the objectives for the parser was to make sure it does not 
backtrack. That's because it's completely unnecessary with my defined 
syntax, and because it is a possible reason for Parse::RecDescent's slowness
(especially on a slightly invalid syntax, which causes it to frantically
try different options).
</p>

<p>
The parser is now parsing a subset of the functionality and is getting there.
It indeed feels very "quick-and-dirty" and raw. Perhaps a better design would
be to use some kind of a state machine or a decision tree. I also found a use
for <tt>redo</tt> in the first time in a long while, as I had a 
<tt>while ... continue { $self-&gt;next_line() }</tt> construct, and was 
trying to avoid executing the <tt>continue {...}</tt> block.
</p>

<p>
One catch is that I split the text into lines, and handle one line at the 
time. Due to the sytnax, it sometimes complicates matters and sometimes
facilitates them.
</p>

<p>
It may actually be harder than having written the P::RD-based parser, and is
time consuming. I often find that I have to take rests in between and do
something which is more straightforward to do. But it is a fun, in a 
rather braindead way. At least when it's done, I (and others) would be able
to work on my screenplays with less frustrations and with more style, which 
is why I'm doing it.
