OK, as I expected <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Shlomi+Fish/journal/36050">my 
previous entry</a> sparked an active discussion - nothing like a good 
licences war to liven things up. But it was more civil than I expected.
Here's a much more technical entry.
</p>

<p>
As I discovered, <a href="http://cpantesters.perl.org/show/Test-Run.html#Test-Run-0.0115">Test-Run-0.0115 
consistently failed to pass "./Build test" on all BSD systems</a>, while doing
mostly fine on Linux. Inspecting the logs of the failure
yielded a "File name too long" error. What happened was that I created a
filename that was artificially very long (<tt>../t/../t/../t/</tt>), but still 
well within the limits of my Linux system's 4096 bytes limit for file paths. 
However, as I discovered the POSIX standard defined a minimum of 256 bytes
for maximal paths which is what BSD is supporting.
</p>

<p>
The reason I had this long path in the first place was to make sure long paths
are handled properly by the harness output after some customisations. This
in turn was inspired by a problem I found when using Test-Run at my workplace
for some internal test suite, which inspired me to write the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Run-Plugin-TrimDisplayedFilenames/">Trim-displayed-Filenames plugin</a>.
</p>

<p>
So after I received all these failure reports, I added some logic to
<tt>t/output.t</tt> that makes use of POSIX::PATH_MAX() to keep the
path at bay. A bit convulted, but it now 
<a href="http://cpantesters.perl.org/show/Test-Run.html#Test-Run-0.0116">passes
on BSD systems (as well as Linux and Solaris)</a>, with a two isolated
failures on Linux, which I have not looked into yet. I'd like to thank apeiron
from Freenode for testing the pre-release in Mac OS X and verifying it
works there.
</p>

<p>
In any case, I'm a bit tired of doing unknowledgable UNIX programming, and
therefore would like to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Environment-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0201433079">the 
2nd edition of Stevens' book</a> (which is considered the Bible of UNIX
programming). The book is kinda costy, and big (960 pages), so I think I'll
renew my <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">Safari subscription</a> and
see if I can read it there effectively. If I can't I'll just use it for
something else, and order a paper-copy of the book.
</p>

<p>
And finally, I wonder how a 256-octets path limit can ever be enough. In this
day and age of long filenames and UTF-8 ones (which require several bytes), 
one can expect that a path with a few especially long components
will quickly overflow such a short limit. Can any BSD users comment?
</p>

Thanks!
</p>

<p>
Interesting. I guess the original path I used was longer than 1024, but still shorter than 4096. 1024 does sound more reasonable. I guess the POSIX standard defines the minimal limit as "256" but some systems naturally have a greater value. I also know the Perl POSIX.pm contains "PATH_MAX", "_PC_PATH_MAX" and "_POSIX_PATH_MAX", but I'm not sure what the exact differences are.
</p>

Thanks for the link. It looks interesting, but since it's kinda long, I only skimmed it so far.
