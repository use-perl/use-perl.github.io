W00t! My grant application for working on 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-RSS/">XML-RSS</a>, 
<a href="http://news.perl-foundation.org/2007/01/grants_awards.html">has been
accepted</a>. I'd like to thank the grant committee for accepting it, and Ask
BjÃÂ¸rn Hansen for speaking for me, and for his support and cooperation in the 
previous XML::RSS hacking activity I did. 
</p>

<p>
I've been blogging about my XML::RSS work here previously, and so will probably
blog on as I go into the grant. So here is an update:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>We're down to 12 open bugs in the
<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=XML-RSS">XML-RSS
bugs queue</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
At the moment, the difference between my local SVK repository's trunk and the 
svn.perl.org trunk is 
<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=23983">this 
permaLink-related patch</a>, as well as a sample RSS file that is present in 
the distribution, but that was not commited yet. So thanks should go to Ask for
applying all my patches.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I've requested a commit bit on the master XML-RSS repository, so I can refactor
the code more conveniently, and do other changes. I hope Ask agrees to that.
If not, then perhaps I'll investigate pushing changesets from my local SVK 
repository to a remote subversion repository, from which Ask can later download
changes.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
One problem I've encountered is that ABH and I live in radically different
timezones, and that lately I've had trouble finding him logged on to his
Instant Messaging account. Hopefully we can figure out a proper workflow 
between us, despite these limitations.
</p>

<p>
And finally I'd like to remind people of <a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/offers/o-and-m-2006-08/">the 
Web-CPAN T-Shirts offer</a> that also applies to XML::RSS.
</p>
