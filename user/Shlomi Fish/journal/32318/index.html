<div class="span8">
<p><p>
This post is not strictly about Perl, but it is technical and about automated 
testing, which is a hot topic nowadays in the Perl world, so I decided to post
it here.
</p>

<p>
I have written <a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">an ANSI C library called
"Freecell Solver"</a>, which solves several variants of card solitaire. Now,
the problem is that it doesn't have any automated tests yet, and I'd like to
add some before I hack on it further. 
</p>

<p>
Now, having attended <a href="http://www.osdc.org.il/2006/talk.html?id=66">Ori 
Peleg's presentation "Thoughts on Testing"</a> on three different occassions,
I became convinced that testing can only be done with dynamic languages, and
writing complex test logic in C or Java should be avoided. Now, I may still be
able to use perl for generating some simple C code for unit tests, that will 
then be compiled, or for system tests of the solver. However, it will probably
not be very suitable for more complex unit or integration tests, because of
its complex C extension API. So I'm looking for a better alternative.
</p>

<p>
One thing I've decided is that all my tests will produce <a href="http://perl-qa.yi.org/index.php/TAP">TAP</a> 
output, so I can use a good TAP analyser like Test::Run or TAPx::Parser, to
process all the test scripts or a subset of them. If necessary, I will write
a rudimentary TAP-outputting test framework in the language I choose.
</p>

<p>
Let me enumerate the options I see and what I think of them:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
Perl with XS - like I said - too complex and will require a lot of coding.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Perl with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Inline/">Inline::C</a>. This 
could hide away some of the complexity but I believe some complexity will
still remain, as it still requires writing some code using XS.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I could use <a href="http://www.swig.or">SWIG</a> to write my bindings. My
former experience with SWIG, however, was not entirely positive as it doesn't 
handle pointers meaning arrays and other Cisms well, and often necessitates 
writing some glue code. By using SWIG, I could still write my unit tests in
Perl.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> - I'm not entirely fond of it and
think I'd like Ruby better.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> - I was told it has an even 
better extensibility API than Python, and it's also more similar to Perl. I
do not intend any normal end-user to run the test suite so I can rely on Ruby
being around.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.tcl.tk/">Tcl</a> - should have a good extensibility API,
but from what I know strings are null-terminated, and I dislike it quite a bit,
so if at all - Ruby would be preferable. I mentioned it here for completeness'
sake.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> - small and with a good extensibility
API. I don't think it's as rich as Ruby or Perl, but it probably won't matter
too much for testing.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.iolanguage.com/">The Io Language</a> - similar to Lua
in size. It's very interesting as a language, but I had some problems
deploying it properly on my system, and I dislike its syntax for its
"<b>[object]</b>[space]<b>method</b>" convention and other mis-conventions
like that.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a> - the Squeak
Virtual machine has a mind of its own, but there's 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/smalltalk/smalltalk.html">GNU Smalltalk</a>
which works better with C. However, I dislike the Smalltalk syntax, and GNU
Smalltalk is still a bit buggy, and I would probably prefer Ruby or Lua.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Haskell and O'Caml are strongly typed and which will be an obstacle for
testing.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Scheme - I could use 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html">Guile</a> or 
<a href="http://tinyscheme.sourceforge.net/">TinyScheme</a>. However, Scheme
tends to be overly verbose and to lack a lot of nice syntactic sugar. The
same can be said of Common Lisp, but there there's also a lack of a decent
ubiquitous implementation.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Maybe I missed a few players, but I think I covered the most prominent ones.
Like I said, all the tests will emit TAP so their results can be analysed and 
summarised with the Perl TAP tools. At the moment, I'm leaning towards using
either Ruby or Lua, but would love to hear what you think about all this.
</p>

<p>
Note that I don't need Unicode or Localisation or an interface to any 
third-party library, as my library relies exclusively on the ANSI C library.
But I do need to handle binary data (with '\0' and all) properly.
</p>

<h2>No SX with P5NCI and Python's ctypes package</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/wbl/">wbl</a> on 2007-02-05T19:01:30</h3>
I'm preparing to do the same thing with testing C/C++ libraries.  Currently, I'm planning to use Python with ctypes package:
<a href="http://python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/" title="python.net">http://python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/</a python.net><br/><br/>A similar thing (less mature) for Perl5 is P5NCI:<br/><br/><a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/chromatic/P5NCI-0.30/lib/P5NCI.pm" title="cpan.org">http://search.cpan.org/user/chromatic/P5NCI-0.30/lib/P5NCI.pm</a cpan.org>

<p>
ctypes looks very promising. Thanks for the recommendation. I'll also take a look at P5NCI.

<h2>Why dynamic languages for testing C?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/DAxelrod/">DAxelrod</a> on 2007-02-06T21:26:11</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, I haven't been able to attend "Thoughts on Testing." Is there any way you could summarize or provide a link to explain why you prefer to use a dynamic language to write tests for a C library? What language features are you looking for?</p>

<p>If you do in fact decide to write the tests in C, there's  <a href="http://jc.ngo.org.uk/trac-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/LibTap" title="ngo.org.uk">LibTap</a ngo.org.uk> (<a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2006/01/19/libtap.html?page=1" title="onlamp.com">tutorial</a onlamp.com>).</p>
