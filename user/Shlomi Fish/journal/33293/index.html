Being a creative writer, I recently started working on 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/">a
screenplay titled "Star Trek: We the Living Dead"</a>. I wrote it in a certain
well-formed text, using vim, and planned on creating a way to translate it
into HTML. Eventually it resulted in the newly released 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Grammar-Screenplay/">XML-Grammar-Screenplay</a> distribution on CPAN. Here's how I got it.
</p>

<p>
I decided that I first translate the well-formed text into a custom XML 
format, and from that into DocBook/XML and in the future possibly other 
formats. The well-formed text had XML-style tags, descriptions (<tt>[David
walks to Goliath.]</tt>), paragraphs and other elements, and so I looked at
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Parse-RecDescent/">Damian's 
Parse-RecDescent</a> for help in parsing it. Working with P::RD on something
so complex proved to be very time-consuming. I was again bitten by the fact
P::RD skipped various stuff based on <tt>$Parse::RecDescent::skip</tt>,
and had to assign a "" to it. (After banging my hand for several hours.)
</p>

<p>
I also found out it only reported that it failed to parse, and not why 
exactly, at least with the rudimentary logic that I built for it. While at 
first, I tried to use the <tt>$::RD_TRACE</tt> display, I eventually found
it that it is often more effective to binarily isolate the offending text
until one finds the problem. Sometimes I found I had a syntax error. 
And in other cases, I found out that the grammar I defined for P::RD was
lacking, including in many regular expression problems.
</p>

<p>
After a lot of trying, I could get the parser to work. Then I wrote an XSLT
stylesheet to translate the resultant XML to DocBook/XML. That was very
easy considering, but I got stomped on doing 
<tt>&lt;xsl-apply-templates match="*" /&gt;</tt> instead of 
"xsl:apply-templates" without any arguments, which caused the textnodes not
to render. Having solved that, everything worked fine.
</p>

<p>
As a bit of sugar, I created two <tt>XML::Grammar::Screenplay::App::</tt>
modules that can be used by <tt>perl -M</tt> and then 
<tt>-e 'run()' -- [ARGS]</tt> to process files from the command line. 
</p>

<p>
I already discovered one <tt>:utf8</tt> bug in it since I uploaded it, which I 
fixed in the trunk. 
</p>

<p>
On other news, I've received and cashed in my cheque for the XML::RSS grant. 
I'm planning to spend some of the money on
extending the 
<a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/offers/o-and-m-2006-08/">Web-CPAN 
T-shirts offer to have one T-shirt of choice from "Think Geek"</a> as well as 
the "Ozy&amp;Millie" T-shirt. And I also spent quite a lot of time working on
<a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/modules/Test-Run/">Test::Run</a>.
</p>

Just occurred to me I never received a wire transfer for the PPI/Strawberry stuff, I should look into that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
