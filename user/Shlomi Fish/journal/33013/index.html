One anti-pattern I noted in a previous workplace was what I called 
"Knowledge in the Ether": most of the instructions for getting the application
up and running, and a lot of the collective knowledge were not written down
in a collective place. 
<a href="http://tddpirate.livejournal.com/">TDDPirate</a> said he was familiar
with it and called it the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_Torah">"Oral Torah" syndrome</a>.
</p>

<p>
The solution for this is simple: set up a wiki for the company, and instruct
people to write a note there whenever they need to explain to someone how
to do it (or give a link to a previous note), <b>instead of</b> guiding him
how to do it. While this requires some discipline and getting used to, it can
also be done after the fact.
</p>

<p>
Obviously the amount of knowledge in people's head and in the Ether can never
be completely eliminated. But it should be kept down to a minimum.

...and then you automate.<br><br>Make sure part of the documentation process is typing it down in a scripting language.<br><br>Start out by just solving the immediate problem, then extracting out utility libraries and configuration patterns (make sure you do this, otherwise it will just end up being a mess of hardocded crap).<br><br>Soon it will be easier to script it than to document it.

<p>
Yes, you're right. But documentation in a wiki still has its uses, including to point to the right script to use.
