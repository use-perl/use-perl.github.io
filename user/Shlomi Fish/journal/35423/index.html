After I udpated my Mandriva Cooker system a few days ago (after the perl 
package there had been upgraded to 5.10.0), I noticed that SpamAssassin's 
"spamd" and "spamassassin" started generating the following warnings:
</p>

<pre>
Constant subroutine IO::Socket::INET6::AF_INET6 redefined at
/usr/lib/perl5/5.10.0/Exporter.pm line 66.
 at /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.8/IO/Socket/INET6.pm line 16
Prototype mismatch: sub IO::Socket::INET6::AF_INET6 () vs none at
/usr/lib/perl5/5.10.0/Exporter.pm line 66.
 at /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.8/IO/Socket/INET6.pm line 16
Constant subroutine IO::Socket::INET6::PF_INET6 redefined at
/usr/lib/perl5/5.10.0/Exporter.pm line 66.
 at /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.8/IO/Socket/INET6.pm line 16
Prototype mismatch: sub IO::Socket::INET6::PF_INET6 () vs none at
/usr/lib/perl5/5.10.0/Exporter.pm line 66.
 at /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.8/IO/Socket/INET6.pm line 16
</pre>

<p>
After investigating, I found out that there was a "use Socket6;" call
there, which imported the <tt>AF_INET6</tt> and <tt>PF_INET6</tt> symbols,
which were already imported into the <tt>IO::Socket::INET6</tt> package by
previous <tt>Socket</tt> and <tt>IO::Socket</tt> calls. 
</p>

<p>
In order to get rid of the warnings, I eventually decided to only selectively
import symbols from <tt>Socket6</tt>, and imported the necessary symbols
minus <tt>AF_INET6</tt> and <tt>PF_INET6</tt>. In order to get 
<tt>IO::Socket::INET6</tt> to pass its tests, I had to fix its tests, which
had been broken before any modifications to it started.
<a href="http://www.leonerd.org.uk/">LeoNerd</a> helped me with that,
so thanks!
Then I 
<a href="http://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=36889">submitted a modified 
SRPM to Mandriva</a> with a patch and went to sleep happy. 
</p>

<p>
Today, when I woke up and checked my email, I was surprised to discover that
about 20 spam mails landed at my inbox. As it turned out, they didn't have
the SpamAssassin headers. Running <tt>spamc</tt> from the command line, 
yielded an unmodified message, while the standalone <tt>spamassassin</tt> 
program worked perfectly. So I started to investigate why spamc and spamd 
failed.
</p>

<p>
I ran into some trouble trying to point <tt>spamd</tt> to a modified 
<tt>IO::Socket::INET6</tt> module, because it was tainted, and won't read
the <tt>PERL5LIB</tt> environment variable (it's documented in 
<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlrun.html">perlrun</a>. I had to 
modify the sources and use "use lib".
</p>

<p>
I also had a lot of trouble trying to see why <tt>IO::Socket::INET6</tt> 
fails and where. This eventually was resolved by running spamd like this:
</p>

<pre>
perl  -T blib/script/spamd -c -m5 -H --syslog="stderr info"
</pre>

<p>
Then I could see the error clearly. Apparently I missed importing 
<tt>inet_ntop()</tt> from the Socket6 module, which was called by some
functions that were not ran in the unit tests, and so it was only detected 
when spamd ran. This is one disadvantage of dynamic, symbolic languages such as
Perl, and can be prevented in statically compiled languages such as C and
as far as I know, Java as well.
</p>

<p>
Well, but since the code in question was Perl, I just added tests for the
functions calling <tt>inet_ntop()</tt> and added it to the imports. After
installing the modified module, spamd worked again, and 
<a href="http://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=36952">I submitted a new
patch for inclusion into Mandriva</a>. So the enhancements now are that
the warnings have been removed, the tests passing and the test suite made
more robust.
</p>

<p>
As these modifications, may be useful for other platforms besides Mandriva,
<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.module-authors/2008/01/msg6187.html">I
sent a message to the maintainer and other designated parties regarding
resuming the maintenance of IO::Socket::INET6</a>.
</p>

<p>
Some other lessons from this:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<tt>use MyModule ()</tt> is your friend. <tt>use MyModule;</tt> and then
using the symbols that are exported by default is more evil.
</li>

<li>
If you can use the symbols from the original package. If you can't, import
them selectively.
</li>

<li>
Make sure you have a comprehensive test suite with good (preferabaly 100%)
test coverage. Test-Driven Development is your friend.
</li>

</ol>

<p>
Right now I'm cranky and happy at the same time, because I've spent
half-a-day on this bug.
