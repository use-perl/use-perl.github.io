<p>And one another day where I'm kept out out of the monastery (www.perlmonks.org)<br>
<br>
I suppose, it's a sign I should write more here ;-)<br>
<br>
So for the news :<br>
<ul>
<li> I managed to screw my debian laptop<br>
(I REALLY broke the pcmcia part and thus the networking part...)
<li> I go on participating to the 'CPAN testing crusade'<br>
(I really like this picture :-)<br>
I have several ongoing projects about it...<br>
Probably more on this soon (I hope)
<li> I'm working on a module with a quite unusual interface (using filter) to assist debugging
</ul>
<br>
I know I should ask to the CPAN mailing list, but maybe some of you have an Idea :<br>
What name should I use for a module helping in the Debug Process,<br> the uncommon aspect is that all the provided functions are called through comments !<br>
<br>
For example :<br>
<code>
my $a; #!watch($a)!
</code><br>
<br>
will trigger a monitoring on <code>$a</code> telling me each time $a is accessed<br>
Most of you have already recognized the monitor's idea<br>described in 'Advanced programming in Perl' from Sriram Srinivasan.<br>
I also have an assert() function (I know there is a Carp::Assert) called the same way through comments.<br>
A wait(&lt;var&gt;,&lt;cond&gt;) which will wait that &lt;var&gt; match the &lt;cond&gt; to carp/croak a message.<br>
and of course a print() function.<br>
<br>
As nothing is new you may wonder why I code already existing things.<br>
Well, I thought that the <b>non-intrusive</b> module idea could be interesting :<br>
As the functions are called through comments,<br> all you have to do to trigger on/off the debugging is to comment the 'use &lt;yet-undefined-module-name&gt;;' line...<br>
There will be no remaining <b>debugging code</b>, not even a $DEBUG var...<br>
Furthermore the filter approach helps me (I hope) to hide some unnecessary technical difficulties<br> (about the watch() feature for example...)<br>
<br>
But may be I'm just plain wrong about the whole thing, so any advice (about what to add, the name...<br>
and/or any opinion (about its usefulness, its interface) will be really welcome...<br>
</p>

<h2>why not attributes?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2002-02-22T16:01:37</h3>
Attributes would be a much more elegant (and simple for you) solution here:<br> <br>
&nbsp; my $a : watch;

<h2>Beccause I'm following the non-intrusive path.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/arhuman/">arhuman</a> on 2002-02-22T19:06:52</h3>
I'm mostly playing with the "non-intrusive"  Idea,<br>
I mean look at the following code<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:<br>
<br>
<code>
#use MyDebug;<br/><br/>my $a;#!watch($a)!<br/><br/>for my $i (1..10) {
 $a*=$i;
}<br/><br/>print $a;
</code>
<br><br/><br/>This is perfectly valid code.<br>
Now If I uncomment the 'use Mydebug;' line it will alsos works,<br>
And I'll get a message each time $a is accessed.<br>
<br>
If I understand well the Attribute::Handlers module, there's no easy way to turn on/off the features.<br>
(There will be the 'use AttribDecl;' line and the code will be crippled with ': watch;')<br>
In the end the only solution I see will be to always use the AttrDecl modules and turn on/off the debug feature via a variable which is not much different to my mind from using the usual $DEBUG var with debug code or the way Carp::Assert works...<br>
<br>
The only usefulness would be, IMHO, the autotie usage which could be used behind the scene, but as I manage to do it 'by hand' and beccause as it's hidden, elegance/simplicity isn't a requirement (Did I really say that !?!?) I see no reason to add Attribute::Handlers to MyDebug's required modules.<br>
<br>
But as you're not the first person telling me that, I start to wonder if I don't miss something or even if this I'm the only one seeing the usefulness/beauty of the non-intrusive interface.<br>

I think its just that your way <b>looks</b> like an icky hack, though I do see the value in being able to just not use your module and have the code still work.<br> <br>But appearances count<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br> <br>Plus with attributes typos will be caught (like "wathc") whereas if its in a comment there's no validation.  So it has the additional nicety of being a bit more formal.

<em>But appearances count<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</em> <br>
<br>
Point taken...<br>
You're totally right on this.<br>
It's quite hard to find the balance between a simple clean syntax and a syntax which could be clearly distinguished from "normal" comments.<br>
I clearly emphazized the later...<br>
Any suggestion is welcome, I wonder if 'watch($a)' anywhere in a comment wouldn't be enough...<br>
<br>
BTW: What would be your proposition for this module's name ?

<h2>What about use constant?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/BooK/">BooK</a> on 2002-02-25T09:22:35</h3>
<blockquote><div>There will be no remaining <b>debugging code</b>, not even a $DEBUG var...</div></blockquote>
<p>Well, you know that <tt>use constant</tt> doesn't change the behaviour or performance of your program...</p>
<code>use constant DEBUG =&gt; 1;<br>
if( DEBUG ) {<br>
    # debug code is optimised away<br>
    # when you set DEBUG to 0<br>
    # you can easily check this with B::Deparse<br>
}
</code>
<p>Naturally, this adds to the code, but I'd
say it's more natural than comments. Or you
could use pod: Michael Schwern is working on
<tt>=for testing</tt>, you could as well add
<tt>=for debug</tt>...</p>
