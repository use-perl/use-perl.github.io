<p>It's been a long time, since my last entry,<br>
so it's maybe the right moment for some news.<br>
<br>
Professionnally things are going better, nothing
sure,<br>
 but some opportunies seem to become more and more precise.<br>
 (more on this later).<br>
<br>
To my great shame I've not been as much into Perl as I'd wanted.<br>
I can't stay on perlmonks.org anymore <br>
(dial-up access costs me really to much for such activity...)<br>
 but I try
to stay informed about what's hapenning in the Perl community anyway.<br>
<br>
The French "Mongueurs" really help me to keep in touch<br> (especially  Mirod and Echo with their TPC's reports).<br>
These reports are REALLY excellents !<br> I really hope they'll put them online for all french speaking Perl lovers.<br>
<br>
I (Finally) uploaded Devel::StealthDebug (final name, that's also another story)<br> to CPAN.<br>
Please don't hesitate to play with it, make comments, report bugs...<br>
<br>
Ok, I have to go, It's time to work...<br>
;-)<br>
Bye...</p>
