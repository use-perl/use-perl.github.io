<p><p>So, as is quickly becoming common knowledge -- but not so common that I don't have an urge to write a <b>Me FAQ</b> -- I'm leaving Concordia where I've been working for, well, forever, or four years, whichever comes first. This shocks people, but that's probably because as far as they know I've <b>always</b> been in Montreal, because before I was in Montreal, I wasn't on the 'net.

<p>I was on <b>FidoNET</b>, though. I think being on FidoNET should get you a bit of cred. <b>ARPANET</b> gets you cred. FidoNET gets strange looks, most of the time, or sad nods. I can't even remember my node number anymore. But I digress.

<p>Right, so I'm going to go work at <a href="http://www.e-smith.com/">e-smith</a> -- or what <b>was</b> e-smith but is now a division of <b>Mitel</b> -- which means moving to Ottawa. I haven't had to move house in six years. That's the longest I've ever lived in one place. This is a <b>complicated story</b> that I will only explain in person. I'm sort of glad to get out of this apartment, which has always been less than spectacular. But it's the <b>boxes</b> and the packing and the lifting and the moving and the <b>driving the truck</b> and the cat and <b>what am I going to do with the cat?</b> and the subletting and the apartment-hunting.

<p>And the <b>surprisingly deep</b> reliance on the computing facilities of my soon-to-be-former place of employment.

<p>I've spent an entire weekend <b>logically moving</b>. Going room (server) to room (workstation), packing up boxes (tarballs) and loading them into trucks (other tarballs) and moving them all to a new home (friend's colo -- wankel++) and then unpacking (<b>Guess.</b>) and taking all of this stuff from a handful of machines and shoving it all in one place. 

<p>What's frightening about this is that we're not just talking about a <b>home directory</b> here; rather, mail for three domains and half a dozen people, a half-dozen websites including the ever-amusing <a href="http://chiffboard.mati.ca.">forums</a> of -- and I quote -- <a href="http://www.chiffandfipple.com.">Chiff and Fipple</a>, the Poststructural Internet <b>Tinwhistle</b> Experience -- and a <b>running news server</b>. I think it's the news server that made it surreal. It's sort of like moving house and then the movers see all the safes.

<p>But it's <b>done</b>. Or at least the presentable bits are; just like a physical move, my logical move involved unpacking all of the stuff other people see and then hastily shoving a bunch of unpacked boxes into the closet.

<p>They could shut down my workstation now and I <b>wouldn't know</b>. Weird feeling.</p>
