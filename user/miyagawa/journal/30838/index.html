<p>I finished writing the slides for Plagger on 4am, did a quick reharsal and went down to the bed.<br/><br/>The cellphone alarm makes me wake up 7:30 and I went down to the venue without breakfast. Wow, lots of people were there!<br/><br/>Even if I didn't do any serious reharsal, and the material for slides are quite new, the talk went really really well. It was just right on time and I thought it attracted enough amount of people down there. YAY!<br/><br/>I finished writing the slides for Google Maps tilting LT and we went to the Pizza place very close to the venue, which was nice. The talk was ovbiously only 5 minutes but the live demo went really well, too. YAY again!<br/><br/>Other than my talks, I attended to kane's Legal XXX Perl talk which was AWESOME. He hacked lots of internal stuff like CORE::GLOBAL to make Alias' Acme::BadExample code really work. That was a fantastic and evil hack.<br/><br/>Lightning talks were full of interesting ones. cog's "I have a dream" one was great, and Juerd's "undef isn't" was really entertaining.</p>

<h2>undef it is!</h2>

Oh yeah! I think if I had to vote for one, it would be Juerd's talk. Sick, and absolutely brilliant!



<h2>Top Demo</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2006-09-01T21:33:52</h3>
That was a superb intro to the lightning talks.  And the manner in which you did it was superb.  Combining so many different technologies -- that's what Perl should be really good at.
