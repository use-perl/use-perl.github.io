<p>YAPC::EU day 1 was fantastic.<br/><br/>The conference started with Larry Wall's keynote. The talk was as good as usual, and in my opinion much better than the past ones. He talked about "Family" and "Species" of programming language design.<br/><br/>I had a good conversation with Norman about applying his Rabin Karpe to automatic detection of repeated chunk in HTML, to auto-generate templates behind that. I wish I could hack on that sometime during the conference, maybe tonight or tomorrow night.<br/><br/>Finally met with Dave Cross and Simon Cozens. Not so much talk so far but we'll end up that in the conference dinner or something.<br/><br/>We went to a bar for glasses of beer and i got two Guiness, sponsored by Best Practical Solutions. sponsors++!<br/><br/>kane and clkao asked me to check the quality of the Japanese restaurant in front of the bar. The name of the restaurant was "Shogun Teppan-Yaki" or something and I asked the clerk "Is your chef Japanese?" and he replied "No, no one here is Japanese."<br/><br/>So I reported back and we decided not to go there. I think that's the good decisicon. We ended up with the Italian restaurant next to Jurys Inns, our hotel. We got spaghetti and pizza, which were okay.<br/><br/>Back in the hotel bar, I had an interesting discussoin with Jos Boumans (kane) and Leo about software engineering. Ihduring the talk I noticed how kane speaks close to Brad Fitzpatrick!</p>
