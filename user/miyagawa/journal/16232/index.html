<div class="span8">
<p>Below is what I asked to autrijus, but if you have any suggestions on this issue, I'm open to them.

<p>

1. It's widely known that Jcode.pm has Unicode map problem that
Full-Width-Tilde (U+FF5E) doesn't map well to euc-jp. It's due to the
mistake of Unicode.org's own mapping table.

<p />

But with the recent Encode.pm, it still has problem:
<pre>
% perl -MEncode -e 'print encode("euc-jp" "\x{ff5e}", Encode::FB_CROAK)'
"\x{ff5e}" does not map to euc-jp at /usr/lib/perl/5.8.2/Encode.pm line 149.
</pre>

What does it mean? grepping ucm files shows:

<pre>
% grep -i FF5E ucm/euc-jp.ucm
<UFF5E> \xA2\xB2 |3 # 1-2-18
</pre>

Doesn't it mean that UFF5E maps to \xA2\xB2 in euc-jp?

<p>
2. What's the best practice in develop application in multi-encoding
environment, like web+db+xml applications?

It'd make me a mess while developing in such enviroment that:

<ol>
<li>TT Template is written in euc-jp or utf-8
<li>one data is fetched via XML (RSS) in utf-8 or euc-jp
<li>another data is stored to and fetched from MySQL in utf-8
<li>HTTP requests come from mobile phones in Shift_JIS
</ol>
Concatinating non-Unicode strings with Unicode strings raise UTF-8 Auto
Upgrading and thus raw UTF-8 Strings get corrupted. 

<p>
For example at least, how do I tell Template-Toolkit that template is
written in euc-jp? It calls open() in its own modules, so binmode or
encoding.pm, unless you open template files and pass its filehandle
explicitly, which is not the case of mine.

<p>
I tend to think there should be encoding layers to all
data-stream-handling modules like DBI, Template-Toolkit, CGI.pm (or
Apache::Request) etc. Am I thinking right here?
</p>

<h2>Troubles with Template Toolkit</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/clscott/">clscott</a> on 2003-12-09T13:04:35</h3>
You should speak with Andy Wardley about your needs
 for Template Toolkit<br> as he is being sponsored to
work on the next version (<a href="http://www.tt2.org/tt3/" title="tt2.org">TT3</a tt2.org>) for a few months.



<h2>use AxKit;</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2003-12-09T22:45:52</h3>
I've tried to solve a lot of these problems with AxKit. In some places we've succeeded, in others it's a little more complex, but you can still get results.<br> <br>Partly it's the beauty of XML - that it has been written to explicitly handle different encodings cleanly.



<h2>Unicode in Template toolkit and Apache::Request</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/IlyaM/">IlyaM</a> on 2003-12-15T09:09:36</h3>
See this <a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/pipermail/templates/2003-November/thread.html#5322" title="template-toolkit.org">thread</a template-toolkit.org> which describes some hacks which allow to use UTF-8 encoding in TT files. I guess something simular can be used to use other charsets and convert them to UTF-8 on fly. As for Apache::Request to use it with UTF-8 I had to write my own <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=13547&amp;cid=21061" title="perl.org">wrapper</a perl.org>. Again same idea can be used to use it with other charsets.
