<p>Larry's talk was full of "showing pictures", not actually the usual talk, but it was also interesting. He showed lots of photos he took in YAPC::Asia and that was cool.<br/><br/>I met Michael Schwern (finally), Perrin Harkins, MJD (after 5 years since we first met in Tokyo back in 2001) and lots of people. Nice.<br/><br/>I attended:<br/><br/>Conference for Beginners
Opening Ceremonies (Josh++ for the conference)
Keynote
Perl Program Repair Shop (fun!)
svk
Get out of Technical debt now (good one)
Design for Pluggability<br/><br/>My talk was, I think a success. It was in a very small room Almuni, the maximum 50 attendees, and I think there were probably only 20 or something. My talk was to show my cool hacks using iTunes API and DAAP client/server modules, and it worked really well.<br/><br/>After the day 1 conference we went to the Greek Island for a Greek Restaurant (of course) with Ingy, Luke and other Canadians. The converesation there was fun and the food was okay, too.<br/><br/>Now I'm really really sleepy, but need to work on the slides for Plagger tomorrow. Just went to 7-11 with Ingy to get caffeine and will start outlining it ...</p>
