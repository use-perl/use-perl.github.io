<p>I have a new supervisor.  He started at the beginning of May, was here for two weeks, and is now finishing up a three-week vacation.  It wasn't us :)  He had already made plans for the vacation (and conference, actually), so they let him keep it.  He was moving within the University, so is wasn't like he was changing employers.<br/><br/>He's had some good effects on the Gestinanna project.  He's forced me to get organized such that we could bring someone else into the project if we needed to.<br/><br/>As a result, I have code that can sketch out the dependencies between the various modules.  I can automatically build tests from tests embedded in pod (which I am now writing furiosly -- unit tests are good, but take a while to write).  I can run tests in the order required by module and method dependencies.  I can generate reports showing how many tests pass/fail for each method.  I just need to make all this a subclass of Module::Build and release it.  The SVG dependency graph is my personal favorite.<br/><br/>I've added initial support for workflows based on the Workflow module released on CPAN a short while ago.  I had been wondering for some time who I was going to manage coordination between applications to make things happen in particular ways (approval of changes to allow them to go production, for example).  Workflow.pm fell into my lap :)<br/><br/>I'm wrestling with continuations.  I have rudementary ones in a sense (at least in the sense of a paper I saw the other day), but I can't do the following yet:<br/><br/> &lt;value name="/email">
   &lt;call-out state-machine="/std/email/composer"/>
 &lt;/value><br/><br/>and have /email//* be all the information needed to send the e-mail.  This is a simple and contrived exmaple in some ways, but the more interesting example is when one program dynamically determines that it must call another to get needed information (such as a site configuration manager calling out to the machine for a particular content provider type - allowing dynamic addition of new content provider types without requiring changes to the overall config manager application).<br/><br/>Part of the problem is that we are using a SAX-based XML->Perl compiler.  By time we know we need to manage a continuation, we might be embedded in a loop, if-then-else (choose/when/otherwise) sequence, or other difficult context.  If we assume we will have a continuation, then loops will probably be slow and clunky for all cases.  I'll have to think about this some more, but it doesn't look impossible -- just a little difficult at the moment.<br/><br/>Continuations in the above sense won't be on CPAN by OSCon, but I hope the other stuff is.  That's my goal anyway at this point.</p>
