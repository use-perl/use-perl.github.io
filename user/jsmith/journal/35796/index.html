I'm getting closer.  I'm working on small details now.

</p><p>
My goal is to get the Total:total coverage to at least 90% before doing an initial release.  That will be additional tests, but might also include additional documentation.  I hope I can get that as early as tomorrow (Friday).  I'm at the point now where code is being driven completely by tests.
</p><p>
The first release won't be as strict as it should be on the Atom spec.  It will, however, require that the /atom:entry/atom:content/@type of resources be 'application/rdf+xml' for now.
</p><p>
It will ship with read/write support for Atom and RDF as well as read support for JSON.  I'll get write support for JSON in a near future release.  I'll probably want it for some projects anyway.
</p><p>
It automagically manages an atom:updated and dc:created triple for each resource.  The creator and other similar attributes will have to be supplied by an outside application for now.  
</p><p>
RDF::Server doesn't understand authentication or authorization yet -- and I've not even thought a lot about that except that I might want to limit which predicates certain people can modify or read.  I don't actually have a use case for that yet, so I've not tackled it.
</p>
<p>
The initial release will only support RDF::Core, but I want to extend support to RDF::Redland and probably RDF::Helper.  Support for a triple store consists of two modules, one for the model and one for the resource.  Everything else in the framework is (or should be) independent of the store.
</p>
<p>
Future directions: SPRQL, RDQL, and inference engines as feed producers -- because I want to do magic with the resulting feeds.
