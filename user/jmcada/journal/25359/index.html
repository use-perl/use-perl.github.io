<p>I just found out today that my proposal for a BitTorrent library written in Perl got accepted as one of Google's Summer of Code projects!!!  How sweet is that?  So anyway, I start filling out my application and get down to where you have to prove that you are enrolled as a full-time student in a University.  This is where the fun starts...
<br/><br/>
I'm doing my thesis now and haven't paid for my hours yet because I'm waiting on the University to enter a thesis course for me into the enrollment system.  Typically this isn't a big deal.  In past semesters I've handled it all a day or two before the semester starts (it's a small school).  This time it is a big deal.  The Summer of Code will be over before the semester starts and yet I have to prove that I'm enrolled at my school this week!!  To add to the issue, my academic adviser is on vacation and I just found out that there is an advising flag that is keeping me from enrolling.  On top of that, I'm flying out to YAPC::NA in about 16 hours and will be gone until June 30th.... absolute madness!!!
<br/><br/>
Of course, these are the kind of issues that I like to have.  Collisions between the SoC and YAPC::NA... I can handle it :) 
<br/><br/>
And I cannot forget: Thank you Perl Foundation and Google for letting me into the Summer of Code.  I'll try not to let you down.<br/><br/></p>

<h2>Perl BitTorrent Library</h2>

Hi, congratulations for your project's approval.<br> <br>Last month or so, I started developing what would've been called "pTorrent". Unfortunately, due to lack of time, I couldn't find time to develop it and actually submitted another proposal to Google's SoC. I guess I should've sticked to my idea.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br> <br>Anyway, if you don't have a code base for your library, I'd be willing to share what I have done so far with you. Not great stuff, BUT, not that bad either.<br> <br>Either way, I hope you can complete the project. Then I will just build an application on top of your library. Ah, the wonders of open-source.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

Thanks for the offer... I'd definitely like to take a look at any code that you've gotten done so far, if you don't mind.  If you want to email it to me: perlcast at gmail dot com.<br/><br/>Thanks again,
Josh
