<a href="http://chicago.pm.org">Chicago.pm</a> is proud to announce that <a href="http://www.yapcchicago.org/zencart">registration</a> is open for Yet Another Perl Conference North America (YAPC::NA) 2006.  The primary conference will occur June 26th through 28th at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, Illinois.  The conference will feature speakers from throughout the Perl community, as well as, keynote addresses from luminaries such as Larry Wall, the creator of Perl, and guest speakers from the broader dynamic languages and open source communities.  The full three-day conference costs only $100, but early registrants can take advantage of a 15% discount and attend the conference for only $85.  With such a low cost, YAPC is one of the most affordable and accessible technical conferences available today.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the conference, three open courses will be offered on June 29th and 30th.  These courses are taught by some of the most notable Perl instructors: brian d foy, Randal Schwartz, and Damian Conway.  The courses will all run simultaneously during the two days after the conference.  Conference attendance is not required when signing up for classes, but it is encouraged.
</p>
<p>
Seats for the conference and for the open classes are limited, so be sure to <a href="http://www.yapcchicago.org/zencart">register</a> today and guarantee your spot at YAPC!  Also, if you are planning on lodging and/or parking on-campus during the conference, or dining in the university cafeteria, you should include those items when registering.

<h2>Get the L out of there...</h2>

It is unfortunate that my mom wrote "Randal" on my birth certificate, but there it is, plain as day.  {sigh}

It's a pity, because in an Australian accent Randall sounds way more gheto!<br>

Yo, yo, yo... call me Father Christmas, because, man, it's "No L".

I guess it's quite appropriate that of all the Two-L<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>/Randal \s? L<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/ix</code>'s in the world, you are the unique one with camel<b>_C</b>ase (or studlyCaps if you prefer) in <code>Randal <b>L</b>.</code>.   And in deference to <a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/user/ssiyer/minstrels/poems/1080.html" title="rice.edu">Ogden Nash</a rice.edu>, you're multiply the One-L Lama (he's a priest, Randal) of the Two-L LLama (he's a beast, on a book, by Randal L. &amp; Co.) too!  Quite appropriate for our guru.



<p>
Although I don't believe any of those of use who've made this mistake were <i>intentionally</i> Huffman encoding your middle initial, eschewing punctuation and packing FN+MI into one field -- although in the bad old days a number of systems did similar things to my wife -- your middle initial being L. does make the error of using the commoner (7:1) form psychologically even more enticing.

</p><p> Good thing you didn't adopt the e.e.cummings/<code>brian d foy</code> eschew-upper-case style as Stonehenge house style, that would really make it easier for copyeditors and spellcheckers to "fix" your name.

</p><p>Obligatory Perl Content<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p><blockquote> <div><tt>$ perl -le '@X=(q{Randal L. Schwartz},<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; q{Schwartz, Randal L.});<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for (@X){ tr/A-Za-z/a-za-z/; tr/a-z//cds;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print }'<br>randallschwartz<br>schwartzrandall</tt></div> </blockquote> <p>Maybe we can all use <a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/user/ssiyer/minstrels/poems/1080.html" title="rice.edu">Ogden Nash</a rice.edu>'s mnemonic to remember that the book is Two-L LLAMA, but RandaL who is our One-L Lama<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... and indeed there is no 3-L LLLAMA as per the poem, excepting, as per the poem's footnote, Randal does indeed turn into a "large conflagration" if he sees a 3-L LLLama  "Randall L." .</p>
