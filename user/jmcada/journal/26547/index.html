<p>I'm not sure if this really counts for things balancing out, but it sure seemed like it at the time. You see, the building that we live in is still in the process of being built and not all of the units are moved into yet. Needless to say, there is a lot of extra parking. Because of this, it is pretty acceptable to have friends come over and park in one of the free spaces and not have anybody make a fuss about it. I have a pretty good idea of the vacant spots around my spot, as does every one else and their spot.<br/><br/>Well, not today. Our friend that came by to help us paint today got towed. From what I understand, this was the first vehicle to get towed from the building. Yay. I love being first. Anyway, $150 later and Heather was not in the best of moods.<br/><br/>Fast-forward a couple of hours and we are sitting in the lawn of the amphitheater at Millennium Park waiting on Tori Amos to come on-stage. The group that we are with was approached by some of the house staff. Turns out that the good seats up front aren't sold out and they want to pack the place. They just happen to have a row with at least six seats open side-by-side. The staffers trade us tickets and we move front-and-center, or at least front-and-left.<br/><br/>Sweet. Instant and free upgrade. At least Heather felt better :)
