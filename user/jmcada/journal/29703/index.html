I guess that might help manage things a bit...<br><br>But one of the things I really loved about the YAPC::AU Lightning Talks session (and we had about 2-3 hours of them across two days) was that you could just sign up on the day.<br><br>So I think it really encouraged a number of people that wouldn't have otherwise done it, and had seen on the first session how short and easy they were, to go back to the hotel that night.<br><br>We had quite a number of talks written in one night, or actually on the day, that were quite amazing.
