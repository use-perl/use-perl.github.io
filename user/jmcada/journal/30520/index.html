<p>So tonight I was sifting back through old emails trying to respond to people who I honestly just didn't have a chance to respond to in the last month.  It's very odd responding to an email that is over a month old, but most likely if you emailed me recently then you got a response tonight.  I'm publicly apologizing for my lack of attentiveness, but I have a good excuse :)  You see, I was doing this YAPC thing up until the end of June and then minutes after I dropped of of YAPC attendees at the airport I picked up my mother-in-law so that she could stay for a week (ask cog, he was there).  Then, on the day she left I officially closed on my new loft, which kept me more than busy (fixer-upper) until I left for OSCON.  Now I'm back and am hacking on my loft, my job, YAPC follow-ups, and a backlog of other things that I have rudely abused recently.<br/><br/>So, this post is not necessarily an excuse for me ignoring any of you for the past month+, but more of a request for you to please ping me again if I haven't responded and/or fulfilled/rejected your request.<br/><br/>Josh</p>
