<p>I'm wanting to experiment with social tagging on code stored in my company's repository.  We have a system in place that lets us release packages on an internal website, but all that is exposed of the package is a link to a bundle containing code, executables, etc.  There is minimal description of what the code does, unless you download the package.  Also, it is difficult to find things because each group has it's own release area on the website.  I'm trying to make it easier to find reusable code by applying a del.icio.us style of tagging system over the release areas.  Teams would be able to post links pointing to their releases and tag those links.  Then other developers could add their own tags and such.  Do any of you know what is the best software to use for this?</p>

tag-code is great if it is popular in the groups and many developers do it.<br><br>another way is to have a searching engine that simply index all the comments in the code. this way it goes more details on functions and such. admittedly, it is not that much informative comparing to a GOOD tagging system.

Comments, who writes comments<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br/><br/>One social tagging system that found was on CPAN... Rubric.  Thanks Ricardo, I knew that someone had to have had the itch before.
