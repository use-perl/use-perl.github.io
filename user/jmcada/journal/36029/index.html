<p>Interesting video of someone <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=KyLqUf4cdwc">coding Perl via voice</a> with Windows Vista voice recognition.  I have my doubts about it being much different with any other software.</p>

<h2>Ha!</h2>

Hilarious!  I admire the persistence of the speaker.<br>



<h2>amusing, but lousy as criticism</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rjbs/">rjbs</a> on 2008-04-02T13:12:21</h3>
I remember when this first came out.  There was a lot of, "look how much Windows sucks!" noise.  The speaker really makes it worse than it is.  He makes the same mistakes over and over, despite seeming to figure out what is needed the first time through.  Also... c'mon, the system isn't meant for programming, let alone Perl.<br><br>It would be more interesting to see him program AppleScript.  (I'd rule out VB.  How the heck do you do Hungarian notation via voice?)

<p>Yeah, I thought the same. It&#8217;s a riot, but it doesn&#8217;t really illustrate anything worthwhile. Half of the speaker&#8217;s problems are due to his inability to stop mumbling to himself (particularly his &#8220;thank you&#8221;s every time he issues a delete command).</p>

<p>Still, it&#8217;s comical. Even as I thought it was kinda lame, and despite having seen it before, it made me laugh.</p>

<h2>Perl and Dragon pre-Vista</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/n1vux/">n1vux</a> on 2008-04-02T16:56:03</h3>
A friend with worse wrists than mine had to give up Perl for Python. Not by choice, but because his older voice system (Dragon) takes 30 seconds  (iirc) to switch training tables, and with Python, he can code with the same training table he uses for comments and documentation, but a punctuation-rich syntax like Perl or C or Java requires a more punctuation-savvy training set to avoid the sorts of excitement I expect in RTFA^W WTFV.<br><br>Sorry to hear Vista isn't the solution.
