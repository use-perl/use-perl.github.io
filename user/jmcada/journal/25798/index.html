<p>Just peachy.  Nine days before my planned move and I still had not heard back from my landlord with a final confirmation of the move-in date.  Good reason... I'm not his tenant.
<br/><br/>
Supposedly, the same day that I signed my lease, someone else signed with another locater service and the landlord didn't realize that he was dealing with two different people... now the apartment has been rented out from under me.  At least, that's the story from my apartment processor.
<br/><br/>
Personally, I think that they (the location service) dropped the ball in processing and didn't book my apartment in time.  Now, the three-day approval process has taken ten and the locater service that excelled in finding me an apartment just lost it... damn.
<br/><br/>
They finally talked straight with me today.  They still didn't admit any mistakes, but did find an equivalent unit in the same building for the same cost.  Of course, I have to take the deal and I have to sign a years lease without checking the place out.  They swear that the unit is even better than the one that I was getting and that it has a great view.  Fingers are crossed.</p>
