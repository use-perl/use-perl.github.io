<p>I just signed up to run in the <a href="http://www.chicagomarathon.com/">Chicago Marathon</a>.  Suddenly, I feel a little tinge of buyers remorse :)</p>

I never had the guts to sign-up for a marathon, I have only participated in a half-marathon. I just had a look at my old journal entries about running and right now I really feel like going running, the weater is good and tomorrow it will rain... too bad I do not have any old Perl t-shirts laying around, which I could mail you - a runner always runs out of t-shirts<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>I will see if I can locate some t-shirts for you, just mail me your size and physical address (jonasbn at gmail dot com).<br><br>

I've done one before... Little Rock 2003.  Since then I've made excuses every year.  The marathon isn't too bad, but it is like a part-time job training for it.

<h2>Impressive</h2>

I want to run a 5K this summer, that will be a marathon for me.  Although, I am going to the doctor this afternoon, my knee (I had acl surgery on) keeps swelling up.  Hopefully nothing serious.  You'll do fine.  Finishing a marathon is impressive in my book.

5k's are a lot of fun, though the ACL is bad news.  Maybe we should have a YAPC 5k.... hrm, on second thought, that probably wouldn't go over well at all<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>Thinking of taking the plunge</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mattriffle/">mattriffle</a> on 2006-05-11T20:05:10</h3>
I've run 5 half-marathons over the last year and a half, including 1 last weekend in Cincinnati.  I've yet to finish the 13.1 miles and think, "I wish I was doing 13.1 more."<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<p>

Never the less, I'm thinking of taking the plunge and trying the whole thing in September.  I'll probably go back to halfs, but then I'd be able to say I did it.</p><p>

Good luck.</p><p>
