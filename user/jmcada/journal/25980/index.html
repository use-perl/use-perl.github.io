<p>It is finally over.  For the past two months, I've been in the process of trying to move from Arkansas to Illinois.  Yesterday, I arrived.  Most of my belongings are now in a truck heading to Chicago and there is nothing much else that I can do.  It is amazing how liberating it is to finally see this project wrapping up.  I only partially realized it until now, but this move has practically paralysed me with anxiety for the past couple of months.  It's not that the move involved so much work that I couldn't get other things done.  Instead, the move put me in some mental state where I just couldn't focus and get anything done.  I spent all day worrying about what I had to do and what things were not getting done right.
<br/><br/>
This morning was the first morning in months that I woke up feeling refreshed.  Already today, I've gotten something released for Perlcast (though it is a little flaky because the apartment is empty and echos terribly), did my daily jog, took the dog for a long walk, finished up the new edition of Advanced Perl Programming, and closed the loop on about a dozen other tasks that have been plaguing me.
<br/><br/>
Damn I'm glad to be back.  Now if I just had a chair to sit in and didn't have to go to Starbucks to get on the internet.
