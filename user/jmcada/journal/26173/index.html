<p>On my way back from OSCON, I was behind a guy in the security line who got pulled aside for 'additional screening'.  Turns out that he had a little Swiss Army Knife in his backpack that he had gotten from OSCON.  I just heard it in passing, but I swear I heard the security guy interrogating the OSCON'er asking, "So what is this Stonehenge?".  Wonder how much OSCON swag is now at the Portland airport?</p>

<h2>We tried!</h2>

As we were handing those out, we tried to ask everyone "Are you flying home?  Are you checking your bags?  Because that won't work in carry-on!"
<p>
We even considered heading down to the airport a few days later saying "Hey, if you have a bunch of these, can we have them back?"
</p><p>
{grin}
</p><p>
There was a "security breach" saturday morning around 6am, causing the entire south corridor to be recycled through security, just as I was getting there to fly out to a client site (from where I'm typing this now).  Wouldn't it be just amazing if it had been caused by my own giveaways?
