<p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/brian_d_foy/journal/36356">brian d'foy</a> asks people to submit answers/comments to above topic. Here's my take:
   <ul><li><strong>The person who introduced me to Perl showed me that...</strong> No one person introduced me to Perl. I was attempting to install a manufacturing package using the Unify RDBMS and was finding the C API hair-tearingly difficult to use. A developer for the package mentioned there was a new language called Perl and there was Unify-Perl available. (This was in 1990.)</li>
    <li><strong>I first started using Perl to...</strong> talk to a Unify RDBMS.</li>
    <li><strong>I kept using Perl because...</strong> Perl did garbage collection and I'd spent 15 years fighting C's malloc and free. I didn't do anything but manage memory for my C programs and Perl came along and I suddenly had 90% more time to write real code, not manage memory.</li>
    <li><strong>I can't stop thinking about Perl...</strong> because the syntax seems to align with how my ideas form (or maybe my thinking is now so warped towards Perl I can't think any other way).</li>
    <li><strong>I'm still using Perl because...</strong> I haven't found anything sufficiently compelling in other languages to make me want to switch. I spent a few months wrangling Python for a living but felt only relief when I was able to switch back to Perl.</li>
    <li><strong>I get other people to use Perl by...</strong> teaching in-house courses, always being ready to answer any questions about Perl wherever I work, writing new apps in Perl if language is not specified.</li>
    <li><strong>I also program in ...</strong> Python <strong>and ...</strong> JavaScript, <strong>but I like Perl better as...</strong> I can write whole solutions to problems in a few lines in Perl. (Ever tried writing a 'one-liner' in Python? It ain't pretty :-)</li>
