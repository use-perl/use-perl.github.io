<p><p>Ahhhhh spring cleaning...</p>

<p>Just as I was settling in to do some revamping of my <a href="http://www.webdragon.net/mr/">modulereport</a> script to add a shortened summary option, and to make the switch from Getopt::Std to Getopt::Long, I got an e-mail from someone who liked it and wanted to include it as part of his project. Whee!</p>

<p>Consequently, I put a little extra effort into it, and added the nifty Pod::Usage and wrote all the Pod for it, from scratch, removing some of the header #comments.</p>

<p>The interesting part started when I switched to Getopt::Long. For the life of me I couldn't figure out why my use of <tt>use constant</tt>, which had worked since the very beginning, was now failing. After much swapping around of variables and lines, I discovered that my combining of<br><br>

<tt>   our($VERSION, %opts) = (1.3);</tt><br><br>

was in fact assigning () to %opts, AFTER the BEGIN block got done setting option switches. <b>WHY</b> was I using a BEGIN block? Because otherwise <tt>use constant</tt> would not get the assignment properly from one of the option switches. Doh! This is the first time I've wrapped Getopt::Long in a BEGIN block, so I was flummoxed quite thoroughly. Needless to say a posting to perl5-porters reporting the possible bugness of this was cheerfully corrected by the crowd.</p>

<p>*sigh* Thus, the sound daemon was enlightened.</p>

<p>Fired off a copy of the update to the guy, and am awaiting either the huzzahs of the cheerful crowd or the wailing and gnashing of teeth.</p> 

<p>Blah on weather that won't make up its mind to stay warm enough to keep me happy. Oh well, at least I'm getting some work accomplished.</p></p>
