<p>Congratulations to the devel team, and Jarkko (i-hope-i-spelled-that-right) for a fine piece of work. Very much looking forward to it, as soon as someone manages to put together the proper rpms for a Red Hat 9 system. <br/><br/>I *am* tempted to compile it myself though; perhaps after a look at the .spec file from the *.src.rpm to see what switches they are passing to ./configure. <br/><br/>I haven't been having any problems with 5.8.0 (yet) thank God, but it's nice to know that lots and lots of bugs got squished. <br/><br/>The only thing I'm not looking forward to is re-updating any of the add-on modules I've gotten from CPAN. Fortunately I've got my modulereport script to help with that [http://www.webdragon.net/mr/]. Very proud of this pup as it's actually quite a bit more robust than the CPAN.pm 'r' command, and has helped me to catch a number of bugs in the CPAN database itself. :-) Now if I could just get it to work completely cross-platform, (or at least to MacOS (X|Classic), Linux, and Win32...) as right now it only works under Linux due to some persistence features I've added and mutated from the original MacPerl implementation. <br/><br/></p>

Ever tried the 'autobundle' command of CPAN.pm?<br> <br>I'd find it very useful for upgrading modules after installing a new Perl if I weren't always installing modules just to toy with them for an hour or two =)<br> <br>As it is, I have a bundle of my own most commonly needed modules that I install post-upgrade. It's something that's quite useful if kept up to date. No more forgetting to install something some obscure program needs =)<br>



<h2>Modules</h2>

Why would you need to update your modules, if you were previously running 5.8.0?  All your modules for 5.8.0 should work fine for 5.8.1.  There's no binary compatibility issues with this release.

It's possible any rpm-based install update to the original may possibly overwrite any of the core modules I've already updated myself.<br> <br>I might be wrong about this, in which case, great, no problems. However I prefer to err on the side of caution.<br> <br>Just as well I hesitated anyway since 5.8.2 followed shortly thereafter.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:&gt;<br> <br>Been too darn busy to deal with it yet, so I haven't even gone searching for the packages as of this date. heh.
