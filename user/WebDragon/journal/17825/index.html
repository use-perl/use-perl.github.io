<p>so we find this SQL Query parser for php to turn a search input box into formed MYSQL queries and lo! it's only $18. boss looks, buys. all well and good<br/><br/>we get the e-mail, and I go to download.<br/><br/>permission denied, no where to input a password. <br/><br/>I send off a few e-mails to the support address in the e-mail, and no response, so I e-mail the name in the whois database, and put in a call to regsoft.com as well.<br/><br/>the e-mail comes back that he's gonna contact the developers. ok so far.. <br/><br/>developers say no, we're gonna refund your money.<br/><br/>Now, personally, IMHO if you still have something available for purchase thru a software clearing house that accepts credit cards, despite having upgraded the package and released significant updates (at least I'd like to think so, since it seems the price has jumped from $18 to $225, which there is no chance in hell of the boss paying at this point in time) <br/><br/>It would just be a really nice gesture to allow me to purchase the OLD software, with the understanding that it comes with ZERO support and that if I want support, I should buy the new package. I can deal with that. Since my only other alternative is to spend the next two to three days coding up a parser by hand from scratch, knowing jack diddly about PHP.<br/><br/>If you discontinue sales of a package, you REALLY should tell the people you're re-selling it through that product number nnnnn is no longer available for sale. <br/><br/>Am I wrong for thinking that I'm entitled to the old package with the understanding that I get zero support for any bugs or security issues, and that I'm responsible for them? <br/><br/>This at least gives me a *starting* point, since I have NO clue where to start. <br/><br/>it's really a simple database. mostly SET and ENUM queries, with one comma-separated list TEXT field for additonal keywords. I just need to be able to  differentiate and parse the multi-word keys .. things along the lines of 'mountain bike' 'cigar store indian' 'juju beads' etc etc. from other single keywords.<br/><br/>Right now all the queries are coming from an index listing of ALL keywords in the db, rather than an input box, but still I need to parse, for security reasons if nothing else.<br/><br/>starting from scratch will make me prematurely grey.<br/><br/>I don't suppose anyone out there has a source for an Open Source alternative to the $225 I'd otherwise be facing ? </p>

Nah... They just found out they were too cheap and could get 10 times as much for pretty much the same package... So that's just what they did: increase the price tag. I think.
