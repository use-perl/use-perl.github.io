<p>been a while since I posted anything, mostly because I've actually been busy (yay).<br/><br/>Picked up a regular gig this spring working for a local web/print designer, took advantage of the early spring weather and this great summer we had to bike to and from his place daily, did some work-from-home stuff, and am still working there now. It' snot (yet) paying as much as I would like it to, but it's getting the bills paid which is the important thing right now. Plus all the experience. <br/><br/>Getting to stretch my perl muscles a bit, as well as getting in a little deeper with javascript, php, and HTML4.01/CSS2.1 on a regular basis. <br/><br/>I still get bit on the ass regularly by MSIE's lack of standards support but there's enough work-arounds now that it's reasonably bearable. <br/><br/>Now if I could only get around to figuring out how to make my own website redesign work the way I want it to, in what little spare time I have...<br/><br/>*sigh* oh well. </p>
