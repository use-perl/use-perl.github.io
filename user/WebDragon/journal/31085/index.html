<p>All political BS aside (which I avoid like the plague on a GOOD day, anyway) Rob, you will be missed by this user at least.<br/><br/>I didn't get the chance to talk with you very often, but at least you always had the courtesy to follow up even if it was hours later, or a note left in the MemoServ. Rare indeed is the irc operator who does so. <br/><br/>Thank you for your efforts in building the openprojects.net => freenode networks into what it is today. There's no way I would have learned as much as I did as fast as I have without this forum having been shaped as it was. It felt like more of a $HOME to me than any other place I've found on the 'Net in quite some time. Still does.<br/><br/>I hope that won't change now that you're gone. <br/><br/>You will be missed bud, my hat's off to yer, and here's a merry toast to see you off. <br/><br/>Your work here, while never done :-), was done well. <br/><br/>Cheers.</p>
