<div class="span8">
<p><p>Someone *finally* followed up to my bug report that I filed against Fedora Core 1 regarding Test::Harness being part of the released distro but in actuality it fails the build tests, and should NOT have been released. I don't know how this gets past the rpm's rebuild unless it's NOT doing a make test, but anyway....</p>

<p>Someone at long last responded to the bug report. <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=118221">Bugzilla  id 118221</a></p>

<p>However I don't know anything about the Perl header internals. I've advised Andy Lester of the  small amount of progress with the report, however if there's anyone out there more familiar with the Perl header internals than I who would care to look at the follow up to the report and perhaps advise them whether this suggestion (comment #2) is safe to do, and perhaps help the Fedora Core people determine what's causing the problem to begin with, it would be much appreciated. </p>

<p>their comment:</p>

<blockquote><pre>The problem seems to arise from the perl header 
/usr/lib/perl5/5.8.3/i386-linux-thread-multi/bits/typesizes.ph -- 
the definition of __FSID_TYPE translates badly into perl: 
 
    \'struct struct\' { \'int\'  $__val[2]; }
 
This is not a valid perl expression. It's trying to duplicate 
Fedora's definition of the type, struct { int __val[2]; }. I 
commented out the offending line, and Test::Harness builds without 
warning. I don't know if there's any harm in removing the 
definition, nor do I know what it should look like.</pre></blockquote></p>

Andy kindly pointed me to https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2729 wherein more related info to this issue can be found.<br> <br>It *appears* as though more than one header file may be related although this seems to be a bit dated now. (noting the Test::Harness version number mentioned in some of the reports.



<h2>Not a Test::Harness bug.</h2>

This isn't a bug in Test::Harness, its just exposing a bug in an h2ph generated file.  See my reply on the bug for details.

1. if you want to see how the rpm has been built, look at the spec file in the srpm (e.g. does it make a "make test" or not)<br/><br/>2. the perl 5.8.5 that comes in mandrakelinux 10.1 beta 2 has a patched h2ph (by me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) that hopefully avoids this error. Anyway the fedora perl packager will probably need to patch by hand the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.ph files. The h2ph docs warn against this<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
