<p>Ugh. Sick all weekend. Still recovering. No thanks to one of my roomies who was sick for days before actually telling anyone. Grrrrrrr. <br/><br/>At least the weather is improving. <br/><br/>Wrote several report scripts for the website client I'm working with, so that he could see which products were currently represented in the database, so he could better cross-reference what still needs to be added. (Notwithstanding I'd gift-wrapped a spreadsheet template they could all fill out, and wrote a batch-import script to suck that spreadsheet into the DB, two months ago... did _everything_ get into the spreadsheet? no? why not? aarrgghhh.) <br/><br/>So I dealt with the endless questions of "why is this not on the site? why is _this_ not on the site?" ad infinitum, by repeatedly pointing out the presense of the spreadsheet two months ago that had every opportunity to be examined and added to, then. Eventually we got past that and are agreed upon doing a new spreadsheet for the remaining products, and have also agreed that none more will be added until everyone is certain that this new sheet is 100% complete, AND pictures for each product exist. <br/><br/>At any rate it looks as though the tech market in Delaware is starting to pick up again, lucky for me, since I really need some full-time work. </p>
