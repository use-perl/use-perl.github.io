<p><p>I'm quite pleased to have heard about mjd's talks happening in Philly area (heard about it thanks to the perl monger's mailing lists) and greatly disappointed that there's no other perl people in the area yet (that I've found.. I've only <b>just</b> started getting together the info I need to form a local pm group here in Delaware, and am looking for more tuits) who would be interested enough in going all the way there from where I am in Delaware, to come get me and actually <b>get</b> there to hear them.</p> 

<p>The subjects sounded <b>really</b> interesting to me as I would like to learn things of a more intermediate-and-up level in Perl. I <b>love</b> neat tricks for doing things.</p> 

<p>I'm willing to send him $10 for a cassette-taped or mp3'd copy of the talks, and a bit of hard-copy, since I can't get there. Will have to e-mail him about it, and pray that someone managed to record the talks. bleh. <tt>:-)</tt></p>

<p>That said, I've been getting a bit more part time work lately, due to my seriously busting my ass and having the owner take notice of this, meanwhile downplaying it as 'good exercise' (which it is. This guy imports a great quantity of custom designed wooden items and bronze. We (the part timers) shuffle things around in the warehouse and un/load the trucks. Not the most mentally challenging work, but it <b>IS</b> good exercise and pays more than I'm making at the moment with no work on my plate.</p>

<p>Hopefully I can catch up on more of the bills now, and actually start getting some real work done. (read: stuff <b><i>I</i></b> want to do)</p>
