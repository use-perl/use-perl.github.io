<p>This silly transposing of these two words has been going on for long enough. I'm even seeing this sort of thing showing up in what I would consider to be more respectable news articles and not simple blogs or slashdot comments where grammar checking (much less spell-checking) isn't something one normally does.</p>

<p>I.E. Apple will not '<i>loose</i>' to Microsoft. Microsoft will not '<i>loose</i>' to Open Source. I will not '<i>loose</i>' my mind over this grade-school silliness. The word is <b>lose</b>, people. Get it right! <tt>:-)</tt></p>

<p><i>...and if you don't get it right, you are not a <b>looser</b>, just a <b>loser</b>.</i> <tt>:-P</tt></p>

<p>Thus ends todays eyerolls and arm-waving; Not with a forfeit, but with a limper...</p>

<p>You may all groan now.</p></p>

<h2>Lose/Loose</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2003-04-24T16:44:31</h3>
But one of my favorite songs is Johnny Thunders' "Born To Lose"/"Born Too Loose". They mumble it so badly during the song that you can't tell which they're actually saying, and sometimes its called by one title, and sometimes the other.
<p>But I agree about getting the two words mixed up. Sometimes there's just too much reliance on spell checkers, instead of actually <em>reading</em> what you wrote.</p>



<h2>Tomorrow's Word!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2003-04-24T16:46:27</h3>
<p>Talk about <em>use</em>/<em>utilize</em> tomorrow!</p>

<p>Suggested example:  "I want to <em>utilize</em> a hash slice in my next project."</p>

Advice an editor once gave me: "Don't overutilize 'utilize', overuse 'use'."

That falls under my second rule of writing.  <em>Don't show off by using big words.  Show off by using the right words.</em>

Bah! I love four-dollar words!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>I especially love the peculiar askance glances people send your way when you use a particularly good one that *IS* in common usage... they just don't know it.<br> <br>To make matters worse, I'm an affirmed paronomasiac, and a firm believer in the aphorism, "If the clue wit's, share it".<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-D<br> <br>

How about:<br> <br>Don't show off by using big words.<br>Show off by using big thoughts.<br> <br>And since you obviously want us to ask: what is your first rule of writing?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br>

<p>Hm, that's a little different from my intent.  I was thinking of the Mark Twain quote something like "The difference between the right word and the almost right word is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug."</p>

<p>My first rule is, <em>You own your own words.  Make them count.</em> </p>

<h2>Sigh...</h2>

...this was one of those misuses that I had always hoped would just go the hell away, but no, it seems to persist.
<p>
Unfortunately, language being the user-defined morass that it is at times, there's a really good chance that 'loose' and 'lose' are going to become interchangeable within fifty years or even as few as ten.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(
</p><p>
Ah well.  I miss ironic, myself...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:\</p>
