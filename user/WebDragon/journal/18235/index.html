<p><p>While flipping thru the reader comments on osnews.com I came across this <a href="http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=6632&offset=15&rows=30#221284">little gem</a> that pretty much exemplified what I and <i>not enough</i> others already know. </p>

<blockquote><i>Macs are no more expensive than comparable PCs</i></blockquote>

<p>The only real difference is that many manufacturers of &quot;<em>ibm-compatibles</em>&quot; allow you to strip more of the baseline components in order to further reduce the price, whereas Apple's computers simply <b>come with more</b> to begin with. <b>All</b> computers are expensive.</p>

<p>Also another article related to market-share vs installed-base really puts the screws to the whole 'market share' issue. I, thanks to this readers' succinct explanation, will no longer put any faith behind a simple 'market share' explanation that does not also include installed-base figures. It's  really <a href="http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=6632&offset=15&rows=30#221282">this simple</a>.</p>

<p>My PowerMac 7600/132 that I bought new, over 8 years ago, is <b><i>still</i></b> fulfilling most of my needs. Although I <b>do</b> want to upgrade, simple economics (i.e. my lack of a steady enough paycheck) prevent me from even opting for anything else. Thus, I am content to wait until my financial situation improves. However, I am now brought to awareness by this users argument that while Windows afficionados may have purchased two or more computers during this period to replace aging systems, <em>neither of our 'installed bases' have changed</em> &mdash; they still have their one PC, I still have my one Mac.</p>

<p>'Market share' is meaningless. Period.</p>
<p>I can't even <i>begin</i> to tell you how tired I am of hearing these shallow arguments repeated over and over again against Apple and the Mac, (as if merely repeating them would make them true), but I am reminded of Terry Goodkind's book from the <cite>Sword of Truth</cite> series, <i>Wizard's First Rule</i>.</p>

<p>Basically, Wizard's First Rule, is this: </p>

<blockquote><cite>People will believe anything; either because they want it to be true, or because they are afraid it might be true.</cite></blockquote>

<p>His latest book in the series, <cite>Naked Empire</cite>, has both given me cause to grin in Apple's direction, as well as offering a cautionary admonisment for Mr. Jobs, et.al. &mdash;</p> 
<p>Wizard's Eighth Rule: </p>
<blockquote><cite>Deserve Victory</cite>.</blockquote></p>

<h2>What manufacturers?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Mr. Muskrat/">Mr. Muskrat</a> on 2004-04-08T12:04:13</h3>
<p>I'd like to know what manufacturers that person compared them with!  Dell?  Overpriced.  Gateway?  Also overpriced.  Alienware?  Geared towards the hardcore gamer and massively overpriced.</p>
<p>I always build my own systems because it always saves me money.  (Unless I'm looking for the very cheapest thing money can buy, in which case, I would pick up a $200 - 300 PC off of the net either without an OS or with Linux installed.)  This is an option that Mac people just do not have.</p>
<p>I found a great <a href="http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=6632&amp;offset=30&amp;rows=45#221310" title="osnews.com">reply</a osnews.com> that pretty much sums up the rest of my feelings on the issue (laptops, configuration of the PC vs lack of configuration of the Mac, etc).</p>
<p>But don't get me wrong, I have nothing wrong with the Mac itself, just the price and lack of options.  I have used a few Macs over the years (remember the small grayish-white one with the monochrome screen?  Ugh!).  At my last place of employment, I had to maintain the PCs and the one Mac.  That's where I discovered that MacOS is not so bad.</p>
<p>If it wasn't for MacOS 9, I'd still think that it was horrible.  OS X is pretty nice too.  It's fairly intuitive, something that long-time Windows users will have trouble dealing with.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)  I must hand it to Apple for switching to a BSD-based OS.</p>
