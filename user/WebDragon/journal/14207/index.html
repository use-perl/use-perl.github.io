<p>Yeah, I'm immune from infection, but I'm not immune from bounce messages, angry responses from virus scanners that don't pass my <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/3682" title="oreillynet.com">one question test for e-mail filter authors</a oreillynet.com>, and occasional messages that get past my filters.</p>

<p>Windows: turning inexperienced computer users into Internet menaces &mdash; without their knowledge &mdash; since 1996.</p>



<h2>yes I agree</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/WebDragon/">WebDragon</a> on 2003-08-19T19:05:02</h3>
Windows is a general menace to the computing-and-internet population of the world.<br> <br>I combat this menace by avoiding windows as strenuously as possible and never EVER installing it on ANYTHING I own for ANY reason whatsoever.<br> <br>If I can't find an equivalent program to do what I want I'll jolly well write my own.<br> <br>( note: it hasn't happened yet<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;D )



<h2>They're not getting sick</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Juerd/">Juerd</a> on 2003-08-19T19:33:31</h3>
If they didn't like saying it, then why did they?<br> <br>They wrote that because they like doing so. Can't blame them, though<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Maybe they're getting sick of reminding people that Windows != internet, or that there are ways to send email that don't belong to MS.  Maybe they are trying to tell people that there is an option, but they get tired of being told that Windows is the only thing worth using - by people who haven't seen a mac since the IIe in school &amp; who think unix should be spelled eunuch.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<p>
Or maybe they like gloating that their machines work, don't get viruses, and <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/schwern/journal/14194" title="perl.org">don't need weekend reboots</a perl.org>.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
