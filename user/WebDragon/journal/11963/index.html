<p>This means that (currently 12:40am) one of the neighbors down the street has a raging screaming fight going on out in the middle of their yard between around 10 people that we can clearly hear all the way  down where we are (guessing somewhere between 12-15 houses away). <br/><br/>So far three police cars have shown up to help contain it. Neighbors are popping in and out of doors all up and down the street. Most of us sane ones are staying indoors but can still hear the goings on, whether the windows are open or not. <br/><br/>Parties are one thing.. that's moderatly tolerable and somewhat to be expected in a college town. <br/><br/>This is execrable. <br/><br/>-=-
Cue the ominous music.<br/><br/>Enter the Inhumanly Large Guy(tm), dressed in tattered armour, glowing red eyes, the works, stepping out of the mist that has mysteriously sprung up around the shouting crowd while they're not paying much attention to their surroundings...<br/><br/>{deep resonant voice somewhat dry, sounding vaguely like rusted, Inhumanly Large(tm) machinery} "You know... you really should be more considerate of your neighbors. You're shouting loud enough to wake the dead... and unfortunately for you,<br/><br/>.
.
.<br/><br/>YOU HAVE! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !"<br/><br/>{long pause while camera shots capture the widening eyes of the formerly shouting mob, as they begin to comprehend the situation}<br/><br/>{screams and carnage; wild camera movement} <br/><br/>..followed by ... <br/><br/>{utter silence; mist swirls once around Large Guy}<br/><br/>Insanely Large Guy(tm) fades off into the mist, grumbling to himself about Springtime.<br/><br/>-=-<br/><br/>what, I can dream, can't I? :-)<br/><br/>At least it's quiet again now. Wonder how long it'll last? *sigh* I liked my old neighborhood much better but won't be able to afford that bit until I have a steady job again, blast it.<br/><br/>At least there wasn't any gunfire. :-/</p>

<h2>Solution?</h2>

Got a paintball gun?
<p>
Keep in mind you've got to deal with windage and gravity, so if they're a good distance away, get closer or else aim high.  You probably won't get a second shot before people start running.

It'll shut them up for a few hours, though.  Maybe.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D</p>
