<div class="span8">
<p>It occurred to me this morning on the drive to work that I've lived much of my life out of context.  I've always felt "uncomfortable" with myself, usually manifested as "I'm tired of doing the same thing" or "I never have enough time for myself" or "I can't relate to these people" or somesuch.  But I've always felt not-quite-right in my skin.  The only "right" things have been family and friends.  <br/><br/>I think it's like a tiger born in the zoo; he feels out of place but doesn't know why because the zoo is all he's ever known.  He wants to hunt, but there are these people who bring him his food.  He wants to run, but there really isn't any place to run to.  I may be anthropomorphising just a little bit (how would I know what a tiger wants?), but this is really about me anyway :)<br/><br/>So, now  that I've decided I'm out of context, I just need to find the right context for me.  I have no clue where to begin.</p>
