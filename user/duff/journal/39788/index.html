<p>Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 development release #22 ("Thousand Oaks")<br/><br/>On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm pleased to announce the
October 2009 development release of Rakudo Perl #22 "Thousand Oaks".
Rakudo is an implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine
(see <a href="http://www.parrot.org/">http://www.parrot.org</a>).  The tarball for the October 2009 release
is available from <a href="http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads">http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads</a><br/><br/>Due to the continued rapid pace of Rakudo development and the frequent
addition of new Perl 6 features and bugfixes, we recommend building Rakudo
from the latest source, available from the main repository at github.
More details are available at <a href="http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo">http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo</a>.<br/><br/>Rakudo Perl follows a monthly release cycle, with each release code
named after a Perl Mongers group.  The October 2009 is code named
"Thousand Oaks" for their amazing Perl 6 hackathon, their report at
<a href="http://www.lowlevelmanager.com/2009/09/perl-6-hackathon.html">http://www.lowlevelmanager.com/2009/09/perl-6-hackathon.html</a>, and
just because I like the name :-)<br/><br/>Since the 2009-08 release, Rakudo Perl builds from an installed Parrot
instead of using Parrot's build tree.  This means that, unlike previous
versions of Rakudo Perl, the "perl6" (or "perl6.exe") executables only
work when invoked from the Rakudo root directory until a "make install"
is performed.  Running "make install" will install Rakudo and its
libraries into the Parrot installation that was used to build it, and
then the executables will work when invoked from any directory.<br/><br/>This release of Rakudo requires Parrot 1.7.0.<br/><br/>For the latest information on building and using Rakudo Perl, see the
readme file section titled "Building and invoking Rakudo".  (Quick note:
the "--gen-parrot" option still automatically downloads and builds
Parrot as before, if you prefer that approach.)<br/><br/>Some of the specific changes and improvements occuring with this
release include:<br/><br/>* Rakudo is now passing 32,582 spectests, an increase of 17,085 passing
  tests since the September 2009 release.  With this release Rakudo is
  now passing 85.0% of the available spectest suite.<br/><br/>* We have a huge increase in the number of spectests relating to the
  Complex and Rat numeric types.<br/><br/>* Complex numbers are now implemented as a Perl 6 class, and supports all
  trigonometric functions from the specification.<br/><br/>* Rakudo has a new signature binder which makes calling routines
  and operators much faster, and allows binding of positional
  arguments by name.<br/><br/>* Rakudo has improved signature introspection, better errors relating to
  signatures and signature literals are now supported.<br/><br/>* Rakudo now supports accessing outer lexical variables from classes and
  packages.<br/><br/>* Some new variants of the series operator are now implemented.<br/><br/>* When configuring Rakudo with --gen-parrot, the --optimize flag is now
  passed to Parrot's Configure.pl<br/><br/>The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible.  If you would like to contribute,
see <a href="http://rakudo.org/how-to-help">http://rakudo.org/how-to-help</a> , ask on the perl6-compiler@perl.org
mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6 on freenode.<br/><br/>The next release of Rakudo (#23) is scheduled for November 19, 2009.
A list of the other planned release dates and codenames for 2009 is
available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo
development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each
Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.<br/><br/>Have fun!
