<p><p>After <a href="http://lefant.net">lefant</a> (who has been working for us since a few months) showed me a few epsisodes, I finally learned how to use this strange new file transmission protocol everybody is talking about (bittorrent - yes, I'm oldfashioned and never downloaded anything from the net before..) to get all of the other episodes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/">Very nice sitcom</a>. And not only because several cast members also played in Roseanne (and Darlene clearly was my favorite character there).</p>

<p>A little bit of investigation revealed that the series will air in German private TV, but I very much fear synchronisation. They never get that right (cf The Simpsons).</p>

<p>What I saw of it, I really didn't like. Maybe it's because I studied physics? (But you did too, didn't you? or maybe I'm thinking of someone else.) It was basically anti-intellectual and didn't even seem very smart about it. I don't mean to take myself too seriously, but if someone's going to make fun of nerds for being socially inept, they at least have to be as smart as the nerds or it comes off wrong.</p><p>It's like something that might've flown before the web appeared, when things like "Revenge of the Nerds" were popular; but nowadays? I've had enough of making fun of the socially-awkward nerd stereotype. Ant or grasshopper?</p>
