<p>It wasn't too humiliating. In fact, it was fun! There where two kinds of contests: <i>Binary Search</i> and <i>Pantomime</i>.</p>

<p>In <B>binary search</b> you had to ask yes/no questions to the audience, which would answer with <B>noise</b> for yes and <b>silence</b> for no. The problem is that the audience doesn't have only one opinion, so most of the times you get different levels of sound back, instead of in fact binary results.</p>

<p>Anyway, I figured out <b>FORTRAN</b> (after a quite embarrassing few seconds where I couldn't think of any compiled languages besides C, C++ and brainfuck (which isn't even compiled, I think..)). I didn't figure our <b>xfree.org</b>. It's very hard to guess some terms. Eg, neither 'Terminal' nor 'OpenVNC' were guessed, and 'POSIX' only after some hints.</p>

<p>In the other game, we had to explain terms like 'Kernel', 'Troubleshoot' and 'Hotspot' without words, only using gestures and our limited acting skills. Still, all terms were guessed.</p>

<p>In the end I won! Yay! There even where prices, but what the hell I'm supposed to do with a 70 Euros voucher for Redmonds books (mostly MS stuff, including gems like 'Frontpage 98 Training'). Hmm, there's a generic SQL book, and some Linux Sysadmin things...</p>

<p><b>Party</b></p>

<p>On Saturday, there was the 30th anniversary of Feldgasse 17, the house I used to live while beeing 0 to 19 years old (which also was some sort of hippie-commune, as far as hippie-communes went in 70's Austria (not very far, if you're asking)). There were lots of people I didn't see for ~15 years (some even said "Du bist aber gross geworden!" !!!), and I met some of my best friends from sandbox-to-BMX-times. I went to bed at around 5 o'clock in the morning... </p>

<p><b>Perl Workshop</b></p>

<p>Nearly everything is settled now, we have a <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/apw2006/schedule">schedule</a>, <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/apw2006/stats">attendees</a>, coffee-break-catering, a place for the Speakers Dinner, the T-shirts will be ready on time (hopefully), ...</p>

<p>You might want to hang around in #Austria.pm (irc.perl.org) on Thursday/Friday. I think there might be some coverage of events there...</a>
