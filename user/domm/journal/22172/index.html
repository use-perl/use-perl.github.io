<p><p>Some random highlights of the last few days:</p>

<p><b>Feuerzangenbowle</b></p>

<p>On Friday, we had our allready traditional Punsch-Party (Punsch being hot wine with orange juce, sugar and spices). It featured:
</p><ul>
<li>a <b>lot</b> of kids from half a year to 9 years running around our appartment, playing lego, dancing to Sean Paul and wreaking surprisingly little chaos.
<li>their parents (including us) trying to ignore them while drinking punsch and eating cookies
<li>Feuerzangenbowle ('burnt punsh'?) (soak a big cone-formed piece of sugar called 'zuckerhut' in 80% rum, place over a pot of punsch, ignite, pour more rum over it to keep the fire going)
<li>more drinking/eating, after most of the kids left / went to sleep.
</ul>

<p>
Saturday was mostly hangover-day, tidying up the appartment (a bit). Late in the afternoon I brought the kids to my mother, where they stayed the rest of the weekend.
</p>

<p><b>Bridget Jones 2</b></p>

<p>Saturday evening Barbara was invited to a speakers dinner of a semiotic conference she's attending (and where she's giving her first scientific presentation). I came along, and we had a nice dinner. Afterwards we went to the cinema to watch 'Bridget Jones 2'. Funny, but not a must-see. I especially liked the fight sceen between Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. Unfortunatly the left out the part (as happening in the book) where Bridget Jones interviews Colin Firth. It would've been very funny to see how they manage to let a fictitous person interview a real actor, who's playing another fictitous person in the same move :-)
</p>

<p>
Sunday was kids-free, so I slept very long (yay!), helped Barbara with her slides and was abused as a dummy auditorium. After she left, I spend some time on a $project.
</p>


<p><b>MS Word as an IDE (not!)</b></p>

<p>The 'problem' with $project is that it will run on some Windows. So I wrote most of it on Linux with platform issues in mind (File::Spec++), put the delevopment tree on my external harddisk (FAT), booted into Windows, and - to my great pleasure - everything worked!
<p>

<p>I was so surprised by this that I proceeded to install PerlMagick (which I absolutly hate, but it was the only image manipulation library I could find for Win), which also worked, after I found some repository hosting a ppm.</p>

<p>Now I wanted to actually alter my code to use ImageMagick. Notepad didn't work, as it cannot handle Unix Newlines. I was in a hurry so I did the unthinkable and opened the code in Word, edited it, and - again to my great surprise - everything worked!</p>

<p>The first thing I did today was to install Xemacs on my Windows partition. Because even if Word didn't mess everything up, it still sucks. Especially for coding :-)</p>

<p>Oh, I took time off from work this week to decrease my overtime (is this english?). I'm very determind to spend no time on $job and very little time on $project (or any other $projects, that is). I'll cut some videos, maybe produce a Lego animation with Josh, go shoping for records, plan christmas presents, make up a concept for a redesign of my website, produce a mixtape (ok, a mix-minidisk) as a christmas present for all my friends/relatives, and not much more (if there's any time left..)
</p>
<p>Talking about doing nothing, ...</p></p>
