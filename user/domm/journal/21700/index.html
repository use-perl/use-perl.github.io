<p>Last weekend I went to Munich with my kids to visit my sister, who's doing an internship there. While beeing in Munich, I also joined the <a href="http://munich.pm.org">Munich.pm</a> meeting. It was held in a chinese restaurant called Man Fat. We talked about various Perlish and not so Perlish things, had nice food and a some beer (well, I don't like beer so I had "Apfelschorle", which Austrian people usually call "Obi gspritzt" (apple juice with soda))<br/><br/>And, as it is only 1.5 hours by train from Munich, we visited <a href="http://www.legoland.de">Legoland Germany</a>. As we visted on a weekday during the off-season, there where nearly no cues (the longest wait took 5 minutes), so we did nearly all rides several times. Yay!.<br/><br/>In some souvenier shop I bought a replacement for my allready very worn Darth-Vader-Minifig keychain (my old one had lost both legs and one-and-a-half hand, and the cape was a rag). Yay!<br/><br/>Today in the office I discovered that some books I ordered arrived (Badger Book and Practical PostgreSQL). Yay!<br/><br/>The US elections strongly remind me on the last elections in Austria, where (as in the US) the rural population reelected a government that's actually bad for them. Not yay.</p>

This is the only reason that YAPC::EU in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.DK would be better than in Portugal<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
