<p><p>The CPANTS hackathon was semi-cancled due to wireless problems. I did a
short presentation on CPANTS internals and we had a discussion on some metrics
and other stuff to do. I wasn't too disappointed about that, because I got to
see Mark Overmeers and Sam Vilains Talk on CPAN6. Which was very interesting.
I finally understand what they are proposing, even though it's going to be
hard work to implement and there's going to be quite a lot of discussion.</p>

<p>In the evening there was the conference dinner. Which was loads of fun. I
was sitting on a table with 9 other people from ten different countries:

<pre>
.at      domm
.de      Wolfgang
.dk      Jonasb
.es/.br  Champs
.fr      BooK
.hr      drone
.it      dakkar
.nl      markov
.nz      mugwump
.pt      Ambs
.uk      Jonathan
.us      Ovid
</pre>

We where taking turns in queueing for food, so from time to time somebody
would come up with two plates of food, which we passed around everybody taking
a bite or two (using his own fork...). Other people went for beer / strange blue
stuff (which I was drinking, as the venue didn't serve any cider). It was very
well organised (out of chaos).</p>

<p>We also had the ususal language comparision chatter, and I got some
laughter by the fact that German allows you to stack nouns to create new
nouns. Take for example this word (which also is a fun word for the game
"hangman") (I add some in-word capitalisation (CamelCase) so you can see where
words begin):
DonauDampfSchifffahrtsGesellschaftsKapitaensMuetzenKastlSchluesselAnhanger

which means "Keychain of the Key of the Locker of the Hat of the Captain of a
boat by the Boating Company running Steamboats on the Danube". This of course
is a bit of an contrived example, but it's quite usual to stack two to four
words, which you have to parse right-to-left.</p>

<p>Oh, and we exchanged curses, did a sorting dance, and discussed driving
laws (no speed limit on (some) .de Autobahnen, ...)</p> 

<p>Back at the hotel (at ~23;30) we started to play 'Campaing Secrets', a card
game themed on US presidential elections. Until ~2.30. I'm a tiny bit tired
now...</p>
