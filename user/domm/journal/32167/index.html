<div class="span8">
<p><p>I blame $work and christmas holidays... So, in a few sentences, here's what happend in the last 1.5 months.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lot of <a href="http://3united.com">$work</a> and <a href="http://oe1.orf.at">$more_work</a> (the later one I'm currently porting from some half-baked homewritten CMS to Catalyst, which works surprisingly easy..)
<li>Barbara (my girlfriend) got a three-year stipedium to finish her 
doctorate from the <a href="http://www.oeaw.ac.at/">Austrian "Akademie 
der Wissenschaft"</a>. It pays quite well, so she quit her job and, 
starting in February, will concentrate on her research. Oh, in case 
you're wondering what she's researching: Her topic is "C.S.I and images 
of truth" (that's my sloppy translation of the German title I cannot 
recall at the moment) - and yes, that's <a 
href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi/">this C.S.I</a>, so part of her 
job is watching TV...
<li>The Holidays were very nice and lazy, we met lots of relatives and 
friends. I got a <a href="http://www.carrera-store.com/">Carrera Go Slot 
Racing Set</a> from Barbara. I wished for one since I was ~6...
<li>The talks I submitted to <a 
href="http://www.perl-workshop.de/en/2007/">German Perl Workshop 
2007</a> were accepted, I'm talking about "F**king Perl", among other 
things.
<li>As you probably have notice, we sent out the first <a 
href="http://vienna.yapceurope.org/ye2007/cfp.html">Call for Papers for 
YAPC::Europe 2007</a>. So go and add your talks...
<li>In three weeks we'll go skiing/snowboarding with a bunch of friends 
(24 people in total, half of them kids). We're staying in two 
"Selbstversogerhuetten" (i.e. appartment-style small houses located 
directly in the mountains, where you have to cook for yourself). The 
only thing we need is snow..
<li>Speaking of, the weather is completly crazy. It should have -10 to 0 
degrees (Celsius, obviosly), but we're rather having 10-15 degrees. So 
no snow, no ice - it feels like spring. In fact, last weekend we went 
kite-flying (or is that kiting in english?) on Donauinsel (compared to 
last year at the same time, when we were ice skating on the Alte Donau,  
and even the proper Danube river was nearly completly frozen)
<li>Oh, one last thing: <a href="http://cpants.perl.org">CPANTS</a> was 
moved to a new server over the holidays and thus down for quite some 
time. It's now back online, but still basically defunct, until I find 
some time to iron out some problems. 
</ul>

That's it for today...

<h2>Kite-Flying</h2>

I think its kite flying - thats what I'd call it anyway.
 
On edge meself at the mo - have got a week in the alps boarding in mid-late march. Losing a holiday would be <i>'fin</i> harsh but nothing compared to how I'd feel if the impact mankind has had has messed things up so bad that it would be goodbye to good snow in Europe forever... Fingers crossed on both counts.

Ok, let's deparse it:
<p>
Selbstversorgerh&#252;tte
</p><p>
Selbst - versoger - h&#252;tte
</p><p>
self - caretaker - hut
</p><p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
</p><p>
But that's a simple one, much more interesting is
Donaudampfschifffahrtsgesellschaftskapit&#228;nsm&#252;tzenschliessfachschluesselanhaenge<nobr>r<wbr></nobr> .
 This is a vaild (though seldomly used) German word. As you might know, you can just stack nouns together in German, producing funny words..
</p><p>
Even more fun is the fact that the gender of those stacked words is determind be the gender of the LAST noun in the stack.
</p><p>
So it's <br>
<b>der</b> Donaudampfschifffahrtsgesellschaftskapit&#228;nsm&#252;tzenschliessfachschluessel<b>anh&#228;nger</b><nobr>,<wbr></nobr>  but<br> <b>das</b> Donaudampfschifffahrtsgesellschaftskapit&#228;nsm&#252;tzenschliessfachschluessel<b>loch</b>
and <br> <b>die</b>
Donaudampfschifffahrtsgesellschaftskapit&#228;nsm&#252;tzenschliessfachschluessel<b>halterun<nobr>g<wbr></nobr> </b>
</p><p>
You just need a stack with enough memory...</p>
