<div class="span8">
<p><p>After another year of doing basically nothing with <a 
href="http://cpants.perl.org">CPANTS</a>, I think it is finally time to 
look for somebody to take over maintainership. I don't see any tuits to 
 emerge in the next 3 months (thanks to two big, cool, all-perl jobs) to 
fix all the bugs that become more an more apparent, as CPANTS data is 
used by more and more third parties. Plus there are lots of interesting 
new projects (mostly Metabase) that could and should be considered.</p>

<p>As a first step, I moved the repo from google code (and svn) to 
<a href="http://github.com/domm/CPANTS/tree">github</a> for easier 
collaboration. But to really move CPANTS forward, the switch to git is 
by far not enough... </p>

<p>So if you're interested in taking a very close look at the ugly parts 
of CPAN, or want to tweak the algorithm of the CPANTS game to make you 
finally show up on top, drop me a line and I'll either add you as 
co-maint (or even as full maintainer, if somebody wants to take over 
completely (which I'd prefer)).</p>

<p>I guess that we can keep the site hosted on the Vienna.pm server, 
unless somebody wants to move the site to their own machine. I could 
also give an inofficial short/long intro/tutorial at YAPC::Europe to 
help the new maintainers find their way round the code.</p>

<p>CPANTS consists of three components, two of which (M:C:Analyse & 
M:C:Site) are rather easy to understand, while M:C:ProcessCPAN is a bit 
more complex. It has no real tests and takes ages for a complete run - 
so it's quite a pain in the ass to fix bugs and implement new features 
(hm, bad advertising...).</p>

<p>So if you're interested in taking over (parts) of CPANTS, please 
comment below and/or drop me a line (domm AT cpan.org)</p>
