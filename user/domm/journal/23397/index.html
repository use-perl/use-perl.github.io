<p><p>The Dutch Perl Workshop ended with a rather lengthy Fluxx session. After watching for some time, I finally joined in (for the first time...). I nearly won once. I can now understand why everybody was doing nothing but Fluxx in Belfast..</p>

<p>Even though I was the only non-Dutch playing with a wild horde of Dutch people (and they talked mostly Dutch..), I got most of the jokes (thanks to some translations and a lot of guessing/abusing language similarities)</p>

<p>Oh, and there was lots of Whisky...</p>

<p>Today way to early in the morning we drove to FOSDEM, found Merijns hotel, found the venue, found the Perl room, and hang around with Dave Cross, Nicholas Clark and a few other people</p>

<p>I held my <a href="http://domm.zsi.at/talks/2005_brussels_dark_art_obfuscation/">The (Dark) Art of Obfuscation</a> talk, which went quite well and even had quite a lot of attendees (half an hour before my talk began there were about 6 people in the room, including me, Nicholas, Allison, Merijn, Dave and Rafael)</p>

<p>Now theres a talk on Tangram, afterwards I will (hopefully) check into my hotel and celebrate my brithday. Yay! I'm 29 today... (oh, I should change my user profile..)</p>
