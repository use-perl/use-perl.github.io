<p><p>Today I took half a day off (not that I have regular working hours or that I am required to be in the office more than once a week, it was more a mentally day off). I went boxing in the morning (which I do once a week) ("morning" beeing 6:40 till 8:00 BTW) and afterwards I went to the mensa of the NIG ("Neues Instituts Gebaeude"), which is part of the Viennes university and equipped with free wireless network (as long as you have an account, which is free for students, or know the password of your girlfriend :-)). I had breakfast there and hang around in #austria.pm a bit.</p>

<p>Later I combined annyoing with delightfull stuff and went shopping for some t-shirts (annoying) and some records (delightfull (goldie lookin chain are <b>really</b> funny)).</p>
<p>
I'll spend the weekend with the kids at my mothers house, which should be rather relaxing. We'll visit some game convention (mostly board games) and hang around a lot (well, I will, the kids will most likly NOT hang around - hanging around is something one has to grow up to :-)
</p>
Yesterday I implemented some nice tricks in our CMS (called SEAS for some very strange reasons) using a funky <code>import</code> method.
Now I can say
<pre>
package MyApp; 
use SEAS::Base qw(News)</pre>
and get a <code>MyApp::News</code> class with a lot of usefull stuff set up ready to use. Yay!
<p>
I might do a talk on doing funny stuff with <code>import</code> on the next Austrian Perl Workshop. Which I should start organising. Now.
