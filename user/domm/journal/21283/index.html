<p><p>Yesterday (while the kids where at a birthday party) we rearranged our appartment. What used to be the kids room is now my office / living room and what used to be the living room / my office / the place for Joshs desk and Samos drawing table is now the kids room (and still the place for Joshs desk and Samos drawing table).</p>
<p>The kids now have the largest, brightest room to their disposal, which is in fact very reasonable, because all I actually need is a place where I can put down my laptop and a network connection. (OK, and some place for my record collection and turntables).</p>
<p>Barbara is enjoing the new situation too, because now her office isn't next to kids room. Which means more quietness to her, and less stress if she works in the evening.
</p>
<p>Now for the cooking. I was paging through one of my cooking books yesterday (one written by Jamie Oliver) and found some very nice recipies, which I did today.</p>
<p>One was chicken filled with couscous, nuts, dried fruits and orange on potatoes (ordinary and sweet (yams)). It wasn't too much hassle to prepare, but the kitchen was in dire need of tidying afterwards (with pieces of potato everywhere and a lot of couscous/olive oil/herbs on my hands and everything I touched). It tasted very good (IMO; Josh doesn't like anything that's even barely exotic)
</p>
<p>
In the afternoon I did some choccolat things sort of similar to muffins. The needed a lot of egg, sugar, choccolat and butter, and very little flour . Thus they were very tasty. Even to Josh...
