<ul>
<li>Data using the new metric 'has_changelog' is now available from <URL:http://cpants.perl.org>
<br>Thanks again to Adam Kennedy, H.Merijn Brand and Smylers for various
suggestions/help with 'has_changelog'.
<li>I've also added suggestions to improve ones kwalitee. For each metric I
wrote up a short 'remedy'. You can view all here:
<URL:http://cpants.perl.org/kwalitee.html>
<br>
The remedies are also listed in each distributions main page and in the kwalitee details page. They still need work, suggestions welcome...
<li>
Oh, and the 'Release Date' graph is working, thanks to pointers in the right
direction by Tels.
</ul>

<p><b>Real life</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Samo started school. He likes it very much, especially since a whole bunch of kids from his Kindergruppe are in his class.
<li>We got keys etc to our new appartment. We did various smaller things in the last weeks (tearing down wallpaper, etc); serious work (tearing down walls, extending the heating) will start on monday (done by craftspeople, not us)
<li>And a lot of stress at $job, with various releases happening NOW or REAL SOON...
<li>Plus various opportunities for interesting side jobs.
</ul>

<p>Looks like the next few months will be rather stressy...

<h2>CPANTS Updates</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2005-09-18T18:31:32</h3>
<p>Out of curiosity, how often is CPANTS updated (ideally)?</p>

Currently, once a week (in the night from saturday to sunday CET). CPANTS now re-examines all of CPAN in each run, which takes ~4-5 hours.<br><br>As soon as I manage to set up incremental testing (only test newly released dists), the interval will go up to daily.<br><br>

<i>incremental testing</i><br><br>Just a quick note...<br><br>I know that when a module changes ownership it usually gets a new release. But that's "usually", so I thought I'd point out the situation where two users each have a module and one of them uses the other one; the module using the other one gets tranfered to the other user, who now has the two modules but hasn't released a new version of the one he just got. And boom, he still gets a point from another module using one of his, despite the fact that the other module is now his own<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>I just thought I'd mention this little possible glitch<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) If it'd be a glitch at all, because YMMV, of course, and you may want to consider the module still belonging to the other user, since the new owner hadn't actually released anything new in it and this way you'd have less trouble<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>Great improvements ... log one typo on cpants</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/n1vux/">n1vux</a> on 2005-09-19T01:26:28</h3>
Remedy suggestions are a great idea.
CPANTS looks more and more useful.  One item for feedback -- typo in remedy.
<p>
<code>is_prereq
<br>    Shortcoming: This distribution is not required by another distribution by another author.
<br>    Remedy: <b>Convice</b> / force / bribe another CPAN author to use this distribution.</code>
</p><p>
Remedy-Remedy: $body =~ s/Convice/Convi<b>n</b>ce/xsm;</p>

Thanks for the pointer, the typo will be corrected in the next version (I'll release it together with some other improvements/bug fixes around friday)
