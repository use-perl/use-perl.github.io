<p><p>Basically, because I was very busy, mostly with my job (at least from Nov to ~20th December). We had a 
rather critical deadline, and after some hard work, including one 
semi-all-nighter (which I actually enjoy once or twice a year), we 
delivered and the contract was renewed. But all of that coding left me 
with no appetite for more programming, which explaines the horrible mess 
that CPANTS is at the moment. But well, doing CPANTS et.al. is a hobby, 
and if I'm not in the mood, nothing will happen. I just have some bad 
feelings to the people who send suggestions, bugreports and patches..</p>

<p>I had some plans for coding some stuff during christmas holidays, but 
in the end I hardly ever touched the computer. Instead, we visited lots 
of relatives, played games (
<a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/23686">Gifttrap</a>,
<a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/35179">Globalissimo</a>,
<a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/132">Caesar & Cleopatra</a>, 
and much more), build some lego robots, solved <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slitherlink">slitherlinks</a>, read a 
nice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_State">book</a>, went 
to a one day ski/snowboard trip to Semmering with gf & kids, watched 
season 2 of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0773262/">Dexter</a> 
and ate too much.  (yes, most of these activites are related to 
christmas presents...)</p>
