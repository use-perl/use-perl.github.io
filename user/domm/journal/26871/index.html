<p><p>I'm currently in the quite lucky (but slightly stressing) situation that I have way more job opportunites and offers than available time.</p>

<p>I was approached by an Austrian company looking for a Perl developer. The jobs seems to be too stressy for me (I prefere to work half-time to have time for the kids and various other projects), but it sounds interesting, so I'll probably meet up with them to see what they offer. I'll also tell them to post on jobs.perl.org and I'll forward the job offer to Vienna.pm</p>

<p>I've also got various art-related projects/jobs comming mostly via <a href="http://parasew.com/">parasew</a>. Today I met with parasew and pinzo to discuss a very interesting project. Pinzo owns a small <a href="http://www.karate-joe.at/">record lable</a> and he gave a a bunch of their releases. Free stuff - yay!</p>

<p>Finally, I had a meeting with orf.on (the semi-state-owned company doing the internet stuff for the Austrian Broadcaster ORF) and at last got my maintenance contract for <a href="http://oe1.orf.at">oe1.orf.at</a> (nearly two years after the site went life!). I got quite a good contract, the best part beeing that I do not need to get a mobile phone.</p>

<p>On top of that I'm still doing my regular 20-hour job at <a href="http://www.zsi.at">ZSI</a>, which is quite stressy on its own at the moment. In the last and the next month we released / will release three new websites and upgraded two older ones.</p>

<p>Oh, Josh and his classmates won at "1,2 oder 3" (see my <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/domm/journal/26803">previous entry</a>). In fact, they knew the answer to every question. Yay! The epsiode will be broadcasted on 7th January, so we'll have to wait for quite a time until we can see him in TV.</p></p>
