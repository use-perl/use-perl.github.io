<h1>Report of Vienna.pm TechSocialMeeting #2</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>Yesterday we had our second TechSocialMeeting, with a special guest from <a href="http://bratislava.pm.org">Bratislava.pm</a>, Jozef Kutej (<a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/jkutej/">JKUTEJ</a>) giving a presentation on <a href="http://cle.sk/s5/catalyst-tricks.html">Catalyst Tricks</a>. It was very interesting - the part I liked most was in fact on DBIx::Class, where Jozef showed how to store common queries in the classes (which is totally obvious (and I've done similar stuff whan I was still using Class::DBI), but I seem to have forgotten this sweet shortcut..)</p>

<p>There where 16 attendees, some of them new faces.</p>

<p>After the presentation, we drove (by car or bike) to Restaurant Sperl (not choosen because of the name (we liked it nevertheless), but because it's near Suedbahnhof where Jozef had to catch a train back home at ~23:30). We had food, drinks and lots of laughter. And even more international guests: <a href=" http://vienna.yapceurope.org/ye2007/user/2013">Laura</a> is spending a few weeks in Vienna, to do some German courses (I think - but maybe she's just slacking...). And Andrea was back from London, so in total we had a XX/XY ratio of 2/16. Still bad...</p>

<h2>But how many Daves?</h2>

<p><blockquote><div>And Andrea was back from London, so in total we had a XX/XY ratio of 2/16. Still bad...</div></blockquote>
<p>At the most recent <a href="http://london.pm.org/pipermail/london.pm-announce/2007-October/000104.html" title="pm.org">heresy</a pm.org> we had 4 women, and only 1 Dave. IIRC Dave
had departed before the end of the evening, so when we left the pub we had an
infinite women to Daves ratio. (And arguably more interestingly, XX/XY of 4/3.)</p>
<p>Recently at dim sum we keep getting more women than Daves. The Daves are
definitely slacking and must try harder.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
