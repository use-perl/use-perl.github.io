<p>Some time ago my ophthalmologist discovered that I'm suffering from high pressure inside my eyes, which is (or will lead to) something called glaucoma: The high pressure slowly kills off the optic nerve, which leads to a restricted field of vision and in the long run to blindness.<br/><br/>Luckily, this isn't a real problem anymore. I only have to take eye drops (not of the Acme kind :-) for probably the rest of my live. And I get burned a hole in each of my iris with some laser thingy to regulate the flow of some liquids and thus lower pressure.<br/><br/>So today I'll go to the hospital and have some doctor shoot laser beams into my eyes. I hope he's got a steady hand :-)<br/><br/>The operation is supposed to be very harmless and nearly risk-free (the only risk beeing that it's useless and they'll have to do a real operation).<br/><br/>Additionally, the current weather really sucks (rain/snow).<br/><br/>On the positive side, I just booked a hotelroom in Cesky Krumlov (Czech Republic), where Barbara and I will celebrate our 10th anniversary next weekend. Without kids.<br/><br/>No relevant Perl news, BTW...

We both had.<br> <br>Well, my head was sort of fixed into some apperatus, and the laser was mounted onto the apperatus and controlled by the doctor by turning some weels, so there wasn't any chance of somebody shivering (and the laser to accidentially burn my optic nerve..)<br> <br>It was quite a funny sensation having your eye punctured by laser<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>And tomorrow I'll have to go there again for my left eye...<br> <br>

I once asked a friend of mine who took some stitches in his eye:<br> <br>Me: So... how do they make sure that the person doesn't move the eye while they're at it?<br> <br>Him: They don't! They don't have to! You'll just start thinking of what will happen if you do that and bam! You're paralized!
