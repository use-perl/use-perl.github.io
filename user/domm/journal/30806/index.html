<div class="span8">
<p><p>After an OK journey from Vienna (featuring a pay-for-sandwich flight, queueing for a bus replacement service to get from Heathrow to London, and power outlets on the train from London to Birmingham) we (Leo and me) were slightly shocked by the way too cosy bed in our hotel room (1.4m wide, one blanket, one cushion). Luckily the gave us another room...</p>

<p>I went to the meetup bar for cider & registration . And meeting people, of course. Which I did, and a bit later 14 people or so went to some restaurant for food, which was nice. Then back to the bar, more cider, more chatting, and then to the hotel.</p>

<p>Arriving at the venue today in the morning, I found the wireless to work easily with my laptop (which now also does suspend to ram and dist, and features loads of eye candy (glx)). Larry Walls talk was fun and true (as mostly).</p>

<p>During the first coffee break I tested my laptop on projectors in two different rooms (as I have two talks with only 20 minutes in between, in two different rooms). It worked!</p>

<p>My first talk <a href="http://domm.plix.at/talks/2006_birmingham_cpan">
CPAN and it's tool</a> went well, at least the room was packed (with people sitting/lying on the floor). I used glx opacity to put an irc session over the firefox I'm using to show my slides.</p>

<p>After the talk I hurried to the main room, to do my other talk, <a
href="http://domm.plix.at/talks/2006_birmingham_irc">How to get IRC addicts
pay attention to your talk</a>. Where nothing worked. The projector displayed
my screen half chopped op. So I restarted X. Didn't work. So I rebooted. Now
the projector worked, but my (very experimental) xgl setup was fucked up. So I
used fluxbox (which is very nice, but I wanted to actually put some of the xgl
eye candy to good use). After a lot of fiddling about I started the
presentation. Which went ok until I wanted to start the IRC bot. Which didn't
work. Or so I thought. Anyway, after the projector-problems I was to nervous
to wait for the IRC bot to work, do I did the rest of the presentation without
the IRC bot. But using an IRC bot to stream slides into IRC was the main point
of my talk, so that didn't work out well.</p>

<p>After I finished my talk I discovered that the IRC bot worked, but needed
quite long to start up. So I showed the audience that it <b>did</b> work, but
still I'm a bit disappointed with my performace.</p>

<p>Then there was food (some Australian Fast Food joint, which was cheap and
good), and now I'm sitting in the Catalyst BOF paying not too much attention.
Until now...</p>
