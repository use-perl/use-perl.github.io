<p>Why is it that you go into your favourite record store one day and have to search through all crates to find something interesting and the other day you end up with more records you can afford after a casual browsing through the new releases?
<p>
Do all artist I like somehow syncrhonize their work?
<p>
Eg: the last time I've been to the <a href="http://vienna.openguides.org/cgi-bin/vienna.cgi?Substance">record store</a> I bought four records:
<ol>
<li>"I com" from Miss Kittin, which is nice, but I wouldn't have bought it if there was something more interesting.
<li>"Luft" from Attwenger, their first record released in 1993. I mainly bought it to complete my Attwenger collection.
<li>"Null Uhr" from MAdoppelT, the debut from a Viennese Eminem imitator.
<li>A 12" with great remixes from the Kill Bill Vol 1 soundtrack ("Bang Bang" over beats from Dizzy Rascal etc) 
</ol>

I planned to buy "Null Uhr", the "Kill Bill remixes" were suggested to my by the store owner, and the two other seemed interesting enough after searching through a lot of uninteresting stuff.
<p>
This was one and half months ago.
<p>
Yesterday I went to the record store again, with the intention to by the new Dizzy Rascal record.
<p>
I got it, plus:
<ol>
<li>the new Jill Scott ("Beatifull Human")
<li>the not-so-new Kelis ("Tasty"), but I just love "Trick me"
<li>an also not-so-new record from Sean Paul I was looking for for ages ("Get Busy" just rocks!)
<li>an Anticon 12" lable sampler distributed as a giveaway together with a very interesting german magazine ("persona non grata").
<li>another 12" from goldie lockin chain called "guns don't kill people, rappers do" with hilarious lyrics
<li>and the new album from Max Herre aka Maximilian from Freundeskreis. I liked Freundeskreis a lot, and was waiting for a new release from them for ages. (The album includes 7" and a DVD!)
</ol>

Seven records, all of them by artist I appreciate very much!
<p>
I hope (for my bank account) that the next few visits to the shop won't be as successfull.
