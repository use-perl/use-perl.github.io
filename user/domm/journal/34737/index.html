<p><p>The next Vienna.pm Tech/Social/Meeting will take place on Nov 5th, 19:00, at NIG (same place as the last meeting). We are happy to welcome Jozef Kutej from <a href="http://bratislava.pm.org/">Bratislava</a>, who will give a talk titled "Catalyst tricks".</p>

<p>The social part will take place in <a href="http://www.restaurant-sperl.at/">Restaurant Sperl</a> (what a nice name!), starting at about 21:00.</p>

<p>Speaking of meetings: Last Monday, Vienna.pm had an emergency social meeting at Shabu (people who stayed in the Mercure Imlauer Nestroy during YAPC::Europe might know this nice bar (or "contemporary.likÃÂ¶rstube und urban.heuriger", as they call themselves)). The reasons for the emergency meeting were the visits of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/aurum/">Tara Andrews</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/nwclark/">Nicholas Clark</a>.
</p>

<p>Tara visted Vienna to research some medieval scrolls in an Armenian monestary (I did not know that there is an Armenian monestary in Vienna, but there is). The whole story seemed a tiny bit as if out of Indiana Jones (without the snakes). Due to a combination of a recent water damage in the library and the monk with right set of keys beeing not in Vienna (but in Armenia), Tara unfortunatly couldn't access the documents she was after...</p>

<p>Nick was here to celebrate the pumpkin season :-)</p>

<p>I turned up a bit late, as I had to bring the kids to bed first, but there were still a few Vienna.pm members there, and more arrived later. It was a very nice evening, spent with the usual language discussions, but this time we talked about more unusual languages like Latin, Ancient Greek and Armenian.</p>
