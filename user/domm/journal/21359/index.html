<p>Yesterday during the night our cable modem died. Or something. Anyway, there was not network today in the morning. I called the cable company and they said they where having some problems, but that our cable modem isn't supported any more and that we should fetch a new one. As this means much higher bandwidth (both up and down) I quickly jumped into the O-Wagen (a tramway) and fetched a new modem. <br/><br/>I plugged it in, called their customer support to find out our new IP adresse, got it, set everything up - but no network.<br/><br/>I called again, they said it would take some time.<br/><br/>Well, it's still not working (17:45). Suckers.<br/><br/>On the positve side, there's an net-art "conference" this weekend, where I'm currently sitting and enoying the wireless! <br/><br/>It's called <URL:http://netznetz.net> and is in fact a real-live wiki. I.e. a lot of Viennese people (mostly artists and hackers) hang around in a big hallway and do funny stuff.

<p>How is your unicycling these days? A hallway sounds like an excellent place for doing it.</p>

<i>How is your unicycling these days?</i>
<p>
Well, I manage to stay on the bike for 10-30 seconds<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-). But weather conditions currently keep me from training...

Probably not, when it's packed full with beamers, notebooks, audio equipment, coctail mixing robots, "Wuzzler" (Table football, if that's the English name) and lots of geeks/artists<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
