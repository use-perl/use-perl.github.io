<p><p>Wednesday afternoon was dominated by Marc Lehmanns talk on "What's wrong with Parrot and Perl 6". I have to confess that I wasn't following him that attentive because I was doing CPANTS stuff (which is going very well, DBIx::Class /is/ nice). There was a lot critic and discussions, but nobody was (physically) hurt.</p>

<p>Then we all went off the conference dinner, which was in a 'Pfannkuchen'-themed restaurant offering all-you-can-eat Palatschinken (as we call them in .at) and very delicious Caipirinhas for 4.50 Euros. We chatted about different things, most of them more or less Perl related (Catalyst, CPAN, why PHP sucks, Perl6) and exchanged several war stories on horrible system setups and "deployment strategies".</p>

<p>After returning to the hotel somebody decided to try out the hotels free wlan. A few minutes later everybody was trying to get it up & running, with varying success. Went to bed at ~1:00</p>

<p>After breakfast and a nice walk through the woods from the hotel to the venue (where we discussed the niceities of Viennese cuisine with Andreas Koenig (who is from Vienna but living in Germany since ages)), we arrived a bit late, but talks didn't start until most people arrived around 9:30.</p>

<p>The first talk was about some GUI thing, a topic I'm not that much interested in. Instead I handed my laptop over to Nicholas for some IRC/mail/debugging of some utf8 bug and chatted with Andreas.</p>

<p>The second talk was about some mailinglist management software. Sounded interesting, but than I'm not that interesting in running mailinglists. (the alert reader might ask if I'm interested in anything. Well, I am.)</p>

<p>Juergen said we should post stuff on the Workshop to earn next years wireless, so that's what I'm doing right now.</p>

<p>Enough for now, as Audrey Tang started her Haskell talk. Stay tuned.</p>
</p>
