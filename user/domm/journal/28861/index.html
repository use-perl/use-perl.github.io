<p><p>(Hmm, maybe this should be day 1.5 - 2.8 (as the workshop takes 3.0 days), but well..)</p>

<p>Anyway, after Audreys very compact "Learning Haskel" (presented in 20 minutes instead of the usual 40...) there was <a href="http://use.perl.org/user//pepl/journal">pepl</a>  (link to his empty journal to trick him into using it)talking about XIMS, a XML based CMS. I don't like XML. But it's a nice system anyway :-). </p>

<p>There were other talks, some lightning talks (my CPANTS talk was moved to Friday, as Juerd wanted to talk about Perl 6 Myths on Thursday), very cheap lunch in the mensa (3 Euros for a coke and salmon lasagne). In the evening Mark Overmeer hosted a CPAN-BOF (CPAN for Perl 6 and other langs). I hope he will post his thoughts somewhere, eg. the <a href="http://lists.cpan.org/showlist.cgi?name=cpan-discuss">cpan-discuss </a> list (which could use some interesting traffic). Afterwards we went to a Yugoslawian restaurant next to our hotel, where I had a not very yugoslawian plate of mixed meat. Another highlight was the onion soup, which was covered with a thick layer of hard-to-penetrate melted cheese.</p>

<p>Back at the hotel everybody took his/her notebook and started hacking stuff. I couldn't get the wireless working, so I added some slides on coderefs-in-INC to my <a href="http://domm.zsi.at/talks/2006_bochum_using_use/">talk on 'Using use'</a>. While showing CPANTS to Mark we discovered that one of the onehundred-something modules in Mail::Box was missing 'use strict'. Some hours later, back in our room, pepl and I thought about doing a Slide2IRC converter that should post the contents of slides to IRC during a presentation. We came up with a basic design and went to sleep.</p>

<p><b>Day 3</b></p>

<p>After breakfast etc we arrived a bit late at the venue and started hacking the IRC thingy. Which prevented me from paying attention to the talks. I'm sorry..</p>

<p>My <a href="http://domm.zsi.at/talks/2006_bochum_using_use/">talk</a> came up, and we had it nearly working: I added some JS to my slides that would post the name of the current slide to an CGI running on localhost. The CGI would copy this slide to /tmp/current.html. Pepl wrote a Bot that parses this slide, extraces the last sentence and posts it to IRC. The only problem was that my (old) verion of Firefox would issue a Popup Security alert before it would issue the GET request. Sucker. I think we've got a topic for a short talk at YAPC...</p>

<p>My talk was recieved quite well (I think), at least people where asking questions during and after the talk. IMO always a good sign. After Lunch (mensa again) there where lightning talks, as Gerald Richter was ill and couldn't come. As usual, they were of varying quality, with the usual beamer problems. (Andreas Koenig even had to reboot). But two people were using chalk & blackboard, which just worked. I liked Horshacks talk on log4perl best, it was very funny and still teached a lot. I also did a LT on CPANTS.</p>

<p>More later...</p>
