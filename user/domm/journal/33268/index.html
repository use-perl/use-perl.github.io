<p><p>My urge to cut of my hair (waistlong dreadlocks, if you've never seem me IRL) is getting stronger every day. I mostly blame the (warm to hot) weather (and of course <a href="http://vienna.yapceurope.org">YAPC::Europe</a>)...</p>

<p>I'm still not sure if I want to keep a few dreadlock attached to my head, or get rid of all of them. And what kind of media coverages I should make of cutting my hair. There'll be at least simple before/after photos, but I think it would be fun to cut the dreads from the end (or beginning?, well, the looose end not growing out of my head..), only taking away a few milimeters per cut, and taking a photo after each cut. This could result in a nice stop-motion movie, especially if played reverse (i.e. going from short hair to looog dreads in a few seconds). Downsides of this aproach are that it will take ages to do, plus there won't be any souvenir-dreads left...</p>

<p>mmm, souvenir-dreads for auction...</p>
<p>I think that you could safely get away with cutting off a few dreadlocks whole without it being noticable, then do the time lapse trick on all the rest. That way, I think, you get to have your cake and eat it.</p>

My thoughts exactly. You could cut off a few from anywhere on the scalp beforehand, more or less, and no-one would be any the wiser.<br><br>Otherwise I think the time-lapse photography idea is great. Just remember to jab your head with a really large metal spike attached to the wall or something, to ensure that your head doesn't shift in the frame, otherwise the effect will be lost<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>I wonder what body part will first get auctioned&#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; on second thought, forget I said anything.</p>
