<p><p>Here's my summary of the Austrian Perl Workshop. There's an interesting link at the end, so make sure to read it all (or scroll down, you lousy cheater...)</p>

<p><b>Pre Workshop Meeting</b></p>

<p>On Wednesday, several people met at MedienKunstKaffee in Museumsqartier, where 5uper.net provided us with free wireless, chairs & tables and some strange computer game machines. Most of the time was spend trying to get VLC streaming to work. We finally succeded in streaming from Andras second laptop using the latest dev version of VLC for Windows. Thanks to Josef bringing several good tasting choclate bars we didn't starve..</p>

<p>Later we went to <a href="http://vienna.openguides.org/vienna.cgi?K%E4uzchen">KÃÂ¤uzchen</a> for beer and food.</p>

<p><b>First day</b></p>

<p>After an introducton by some Kapsch guy (Thanks a lot for providing the venue, wireless, lunch, coffee breaks and a lot more...!) I couldn't get the beamer to recognise my laptop due to me failing to set up a proper X11-config. Thanks to Marcels USB stick and Willis laptop I could still present my talk on 'Using use'.</p>

<p>Next up was Alfred who present <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PDF-API2-0.42/">PDF::API2</a>. After the lunch, Jens Rieks had a talk on Perl 6, followed by Autrijus talking on Pugs. We streamed this talk to the French Perl Workshop and several other <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/cog/journal/25113">people</a>. Then Leo and Chip talked about Parrot News.</p>

<p>After some fun with streaming to FPW and back, we had a 'discussion' on Perl6/Pugs/Parrot with Leo, Chip and Autrijus in Vienna and Stephane Payrard and Christian Aperghis-Tramoni in Marseille. Thanks to IRC we actually understood each others questions. It was a lot of fun, and it's amazing what is possible on the internet ATM.
</p>

<p>Speakers Dinner was at <a href="http://vienna.openguides.org/vienna.cgi?Praterfee">Praterfee</a>. Fritattensuppe, Schnitzel and Apfelstrudel. Lecker.</p>

<p><b>Second Day</b></p>

<p>I arrived a bit late because of a certain cat herding effect (I had to look after people from Germany, Hungary, Taiwan and the United States...)
So Clifford started his SPL talk a bit late and wasn't (too) angry. Talks on LDAP, openguides, web development, FIFFS and kernel tools followed. Then Autrijus talked on PAR. The last talk was again by me, on CPANTS (for the n-th time this year..)
</p>

<p>The auction was a bit hectic and not very auction-like, as we had more goodies than attendees. And we had quite a lot attendess (~45). Marcel brought a lot of old/antique Perl Books and goodies from various conferences.</p>

<p><b>Videos etc</b></p>

<p>I just finished cutting a short video available

<a href="http://vienna.pm.org/video/apw2005_low.mpg">
here</a> (3min, 16MB). You can find links to blogs and photos on the <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/apw2005">Workshop website</a></p>

<p>I've also recorded the talks by Autrijus, Chip and Leo on video. They'll be available for download soon. Watch this space for the location..</p>
