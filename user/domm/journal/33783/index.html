<p><p>As weÃ¢â¬â¢ve been a bit lax with sending out updates to you, hereÃ¢â¬â¢s a quick
update on recent happenings regarding YAPC::Europe 2007
<p>
The schedule is still not done (this is *hard* work), but in the
meantime you check out this page:
<URL:http://vienna.yapceurope.org/ye2007/talks>
In fact, we are busy working on it at this moment and expect the
schedule to be ready in a few days maximum.
<p>
We welcome our new sponsors VeriSign and heise online:
<p>
<blockquote><b>VeriSign, Inc.</b> (NASDAQ: VRSN) operates digital infrastructure that
enables and protects billions of interactions every day across the
worldÃ¢â¬â¢s voice and data networks. Every day, we process as many as 31
billion Internet interactions and support over 100 million phone
calls.
<p>
We offer solutions that help companies to deliver integrated marketing
campaigns and mobile content across the three screens of personal
computers, mobile phones, and television sets. Our solutions help
organizations to deliver emerging services such as mobile banking,
voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and video over broadband. We
provide layered security solutions that protect an organizationÃ¢â¬â¢s
consumers, brand, Web site, and network. Our digital certificates
protect over 750,000 Web servers.
<p>
<b>heise online</b> (www.heise.de) is the foremost German-language IT news
portal. The siteÃ¢â¬â¢s Ã¢â¬ÅNewstickerÃ¢â¬Â and forum often elicit comparisons to
Slashdot. But it also features sections on i.e. security, open
source, and even automobiles, attracting over 24 million visits and
160 million page impressions per month.
<p>
Perl plays a huge role, being responsible for about 98% of content
delivery and 85% of content creation. The programming team consists of
8 Perl developers, more are actively being sought. The site is
operated by Heise Zeitschriften Verlag, publisher of the highly
revered computer magazine cÃ¢â¬â¢t.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Both will also take part in the Job Fair.
<p>
We also have finalised the t-shirt designs, which are very nice (or so
we thinkÃ¢â¬Â¦)
BTW, please add your t-shirt size to your user page on the website (if
you havenÃ¢â¬â¢t got a user page yet, stop reading this NOW, and go
register!!)
<p>
If you havenÃ¢â¬â¢t booked a hotel room yet, please do so. You can check out
our Wiki to find where other people are staying:
<URL:http://vienna.yapceurope.org/ye2007/wiki?node=WhoIsStayingWhere>
And/or use the services of our sponsor C<URL:booking.com> to find a place to stay.
<p>
On a personal note, I will leave for one month of holidays in Mongolia
in two days. Please do NOT send any questions you might have to my
private email address, but use the official YAPC::Europe 2007 address:<br>
<b>vienna2007@yapceurope.org</b><br>
All messages sent to this address will end up in RT and can then be
handled by the entire team.
<p>
And finally something not YAPC::Europe related: ThereÃ¢â¬â¢s now an
Ã¢â¬ÅofficialÃ¢â¬Â Perl 5 Wiki at
<URL:http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi>
As Schwern said:
Please feel free to add or modify pages Ã¢â¬â even this one Ã¢â¬â as you see
fit. Fill this wiki with Perl 5 related content. Be Bold!
<p>
Looking forward to see you all,<br>
Thomas Klausner<br>
(who wonÃ¢â¬â¢t read any mail in the next 30 days </p>
