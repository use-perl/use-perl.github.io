<p>Today I went boxing (as in "Rocky") again for the first time in more than two years. I've been boxing for ~5 years, but stopped when we bought our flat and most of my time went into renovating. Oh, and the fact that the training starts at 6:40 wasn't too helpfull either.<br/><br/>Anyway, the training was very hard (as usual), involving 160 push-ups (10 a piece, with some other excercise between each set). I was maybe doing half (probably even less), but I know that I couldn't have done all of them, and if I tried to hard my muscles would go completley sore. <br/><br/>The actual boxing traing went very well. My body still knows all the moves, how to hit, how to move, etc. But I was hitting much slower than I used to (and boxing is more about speed than strenght, IMO), plus after some punches my miserable speed would get even worse.<br/><br/>On the upside, there were plenty of newcomers, and I could help them with various technical tipps.<br/><br/>But I think even if I keep up with the training, Damian would still <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiCVBKbMris">beat</a> me...
