<h1>Things I learned at Twin City Perl Workshop 2008</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>Last weekend has seen the <a 
href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/tcpw2008/">first Perl workshop 
held in two capital cities</a>. Organising it was fun, though I have to 
admit that I slacked quite a lot and thus most of the work was done by 
Maros, Pepl (on the Viennese side) and Jozef, Emmanuel and Martin (the 
Bratislava team).</p>

<p><b>Things I learned:</b><p>

<ul>
<li><a a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/tcpw2008/talk/1594">A/B 
Testing</a> sound like a very good idea.
<li>I should take a look at <a 
href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/tcpw2008/talk/1595">NYTProf</a>.
<li>Check if your laptop works with the projector! Especially if you 
have a new laptop (like me) that never was connected to a projector 
before...
<li>Check if your images are in the correct resolution. Some jokes of 
Maros' <a 
href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/tcpw2008/talk/1591">talk</a> 
were killed by this ("Do you want to play thermonuclear war?")
<li>Another interesting thing to take a look at: <a 
href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/tcpw2008/talk/1529">D-Bus</a>
<li>XML and XLST are still not dead (or as pepl said: "This is the first 
Perl conference where XLST is mentioned in more than two talks" 
(excluding his :-)
<li>I should try to build a GUI for some of my scripts. But should I use 
<a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/tcpw2008/talk/1528">GTK2</a> 
or <a 
href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/tcpw2008/talk/1552">Wx</a>?
<li>It's quite easy to find nasty bugs in <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/tcpw2008/talk/1536">Rakudo</a>, but very hard to put 
them into a testcase that still fails...
<li>Cat-herding people gets easier the more often you do it.
<li>Buying 19 
regular and 4 discount train tickets to Bratislava and handing them out 
to the right people (who all showed up on time) was easier than 
expected.
<li>I probably won't get nearer to "Indiana Jones"-like stuff than during <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/tcpw2008/talk/1560">Tara's talk</a>.
<li>Do not recompile your kernel to get the projector to work (5 minutes 
before your talk..) (In fact I learned that years ago, but some people 
still like to mock me..)
<li>There were more Perl hackers in Bratislava than expected. Which is 
great!
</ul>

<p><b>Things I still have to learn</b><p>
<ul>
<li>Don't write your talk at the party before the conference.
<li>Set up wpa-supplicant WLAN on my laptop.
<li>How to host a proper auction.
</ul>

<p>So, to sum it up, Twin City Perl Workshop was a very nice event with 
great talks and interesting attendees. I'm very much looking forward to 
do something similar next year. To bad I couldn't make it to the hackathon at Jonathans place</p>

<p>You can find photos on <a href="
http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=tcpw2008">flickr tagged as 'tcpw2008'</a>. And we're currently trying to get links to all the presentations...</p>

<p>If you can, go with Wx.</p><p>The main advantage is that it is easily installable on all three main desktop operating systems as a dependency (unlike Gtk) and that Wx "looks like a real application" on all three main desktop applications.</p>

If you mean Windows 2000, XP and Vista then maybe yes, thanks to Strawberry Perl but I see people struggle with Wx on both Linux and even more on Mac.
<p>
On the bright side it will be all smooth in a few months as the new releases of the various Linux distributions start to distribute Padre and the wx stack with it.</p>

<p>Debian Lenny (current testing) includes libwx-perl package. On the other hand the libgtk-perl is already in Debian Etch (current stable).</p>

<h2>XML/XSLT</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2008-11-13T11:06:11</h3>
<p>Well, I for one hope they never die! They&#8217;re far too useful. Just because XML has been used by the clueless as a hammer for every problem they encounter does not make it a bad idea when used correctly; and the XSLT model (albeit not syntax) is elegant to an extent I have rarely encountered elsewhere.</p><p>My main weblog is produced by XSLT processing a single XML file, and despite the tons of small features I have added to the transforms over the years, I still find them completely straightforward and easy to modify, despite having refactored any substantial portion of them only twice.</p>
