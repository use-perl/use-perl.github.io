<p><p>Today I was in the hospital for <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/domm/journal/21778">yet another</a> laser operation. Since I can remember, I didn't get enough air thourgh my nose to breath. Which is annoying (and dangerous, should I ever be taken hostage and be gagged). So I went to some doctores how decided that my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbinate">turbinates</a> are too big and should be removed / made smaller.</p>

<p>It was a very small "operation". In fact, the operation itself was totally harmless (it involved a small laser mounted on a thin stick). More annyoing where the anaesthetisation (tasted disgusting) and the hour of nose-bleeding afterwards.</p>

<p>My nose is still rather obstructed at the moment, but it should be free in some days. I'm curious how breathing through the nose will work out...</p>

<p>Oh, BTW, the holidays were nice and unhurried. I didn't turn on the computer for several days in a row and spend a lot of time reading ("42", "Tintenblut", ..), hanging around with relatives/friends, eating and generally doing nothing.</p></p>

I might have the same issue. I can't remember the last time I could actually breath through my nose clearly without it feeling obsctructed.<br/><br/>Nasil spray (the kind that makes the vessels expand) fixes it completely. Maybe it's time to get the checked.
