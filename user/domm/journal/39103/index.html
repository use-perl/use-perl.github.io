<h1>Vienna.pm funds Patrick R. Michaud one Rakudo-Day a week</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/domm/">domm</a> on 2009-06-09T06:36:31</h2>

<div class="span8">
<p><p><a href="http://vienna.pm.org">Vienna.pm</a> is proud to announce that we will fund <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pmichaud/journal/">Patrick R. Michaud</a> to work one day a week (or ~4 days a month) on <a href="http://rakudo.org/">Rakudo Perl</a>. Like <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jonathanworthington/journal/">Jonathan Worthington</a>, Patrick will receive 150 Euro per 8-hour day starting from now until the end of 2009.</p>

<p>Patrick is being funded through the Ian Hague grant for some
of his Rakudo Perl work, but that grant is really focused
on building large-scale components needed for Perl 6 development
(such as the parser and regex/grammar engine, which are multi-week
tasks).  As the Rakudo Perl 6 pumpking, Patrick finds himself doing lots of
smaller 1-or-2-day tasks that are high profile and critical for
Rakudo development, but for which it's difficult to obtain any
sort of funding or support. Until now...</p>

<p>Patrick promised to blog about his Rakudo days, and we're looking forward to see all the good stuff he's going to create.</p>

<p>We would like to thank all <a href="
http://vienna.yapceurope.org/ye2007/sponsors.html">Sponsors</a> and <a href="tp://vienna.yapceurope.org/ye2007/stats">participants</a> of YAPC::Europe 2007 in Vienna, who made it possible for us to fund this and other projects.</p>

<p>Thomas Klausner,<br>
on behalf of Vienna.pm</p>

<p>PS: A Perl 5 related grant will be announced shortly</p></p>

but didn't come the mail I send you through the spam filter?

<p>I'm not a very big fan of travel grants or the <a href="http://www.send-a-newbie.com/" title="send-a-newbie.com">Send-a-Newbie</a send-a-newbie.com> project. Therefore I didn't reply to your mail (from May, 5th), which was not very friendly or professional. Sorry.</p><p>Anyway, we (Vienna.pm) discussed the whole send-a-newbie project and in the end decided to not support it (by donating money). But we have put some money aside for a "local" send-a-newbie-ish project, but I'm not really involved in the organisation of it. Even though I doubt that the person you suggested will be eligible, you (or he/she) can submit a "proposal" as soon as Jozef and Lars decided on the procedure.</p>

<li>You need financial help to attend (someone from the Vienna.pm||Bratislava.pm
stand bail for you)</li>
<li>Will present "what I've seen on YAPC::EU::2009" on next pm meeting</li>

Thank you josef but i don't understand what you mean fully.<br/><br/>domm: i think you misunderstood me. i also not largest fan of send a newbee, but in this case he isnt a newbee but lead developer of an important perl 6 project (which rakudo already took advantage of) that not gets enough attention, which could be fixed if we help him to fly fom south america to YAPC.
