<p><p>The new and shiny <a href="http://oe1.orf.at">oe1.orf.at</a> is finally online!</p>

<p>As you might expect it's crafted using the finest ingredients of Modern Perl: Catalyst, DBIx::Class, Moose, HTML::FormHandler, KinoSearch. Relaunching the site was a nice project, even though there were some setbacks:</p>

<p>I was forced to switch from Postgres to MySQL (using - the horrors - MyISAM), so I couldn't use any real database features like transactions and referential integrity; the launch date was postponed a few times, so I couldn't help organising the QA Hackathon as much as I wanted (in fact I can also not attend all days, because I want to spend some time with my family before leaving for Berlin / Icleand).</p>

<p>Anyway, after fixing some last post-deployment glitches everything seems to work now. Yay!</p>

<p>What forced the switch from Postgres?  Even worse, why MyISAM?  I assume there's a compelling story in there somewhere<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>It seems to me if one were to have <em>good</em> reason to pick MySQL, then it would necessarily be for MyISAM. That engine is at least compelling insofar as it is essentially a NoSQL database with an SQL frontend. For mostly-read workloads it&#8217;s an interesting option.</p><p>In contrast, InnoDB is just a crippled wannabe regular transactional RDBMS. There are far better choices if you need one of those. InnoDB only ever makes sense to use when you are stuck with MySQL as an a priori constraint.</p>

Because they didn't want to support another database. They are using Oracle and MySQL, and that's it. I was lobbying for Postgres, but in the end the corporate policy won. I can see their point, but it was still painful...
