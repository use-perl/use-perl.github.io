<p><p>Since aprox. 1997, I go boxing once or twice a week. The training is happening at the univeristy, which makes it very cheap. The downside is that there is no training when there are university holidays (of which there are a lot: the whole February, July, September and October, and some weeks scatterd between)</p>

<p>So today I went there for the first time since mid-January. The training happens from 6:40 to 8:15, so I have to get up at 6:00 and am back home at 8:45. I can now literaly feel my muscles get sore. We did the usual program, which involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>200 Push-ups; not in one go, but 10 push-ups - some other excercise (sit-ups, running on place, ..)
<li>10 minutes of shadowboxing (which is very exhausting)
<li>half an hour of actual boxing (well, not hitting each other, but doing predefined combinations like left punch, right punch, left uppercut, right punch as fast and hard as possible eight times while your partner holds his hands as a target)
<li>100 more push-ups, this time in one go (well, nearly, we usually do 40-30-30 with 10 seconds break in between)
<li>stretching
</ul>

<p>After attending the training for a month, I usually make all excercises, but today (after more than a month of doing no excercise at all (besides cycling to work)) I did maybe half of the push-ups properly and the rest with my knees on the floor.</p>

<p>The real good thing about boxing is that it is a perfect training for the back. Thus I hardly ever have back aces, even after sitting in front of the computer for way to long.</p>

<h2>sounds like the kung fu training</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2005-03-08T10:55:09</h3>
but of course the style and techniques in kung fu are a bit more complex and elegant (some say that chokes, locks, elbows, knees and kicks to joints are ungentlemanly).<br/><br/>we also do sparring and I found that immensely tiring - especially after 1.5 hours of training (patterns, workout, cross-training, drills, etc). It really is hard work avoiding a good pummelling after a work out.
