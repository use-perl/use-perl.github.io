<p><p>Today on my way to my office I passed the 1000 km mark on my bike computer. Yay!</p>

<p>I got the computer as a birthday present, but only installed it in mid June, i.e. quite exactly half a year ago. I'm too tired now to get out DateTime and do proper calculations, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>I cycled an average of 5.55 km per day
<li>My average speed was 14.12 km/h. This is quite low, but as about half to two-thirds of my trips are bringing kids to/from kindergarden/soccer training/etc, it is acceptable. (Samo is doing about 10 km/h now, and 7 km/h half a year ago (he's 5 years old). Josh is doing about 15 km/h)
<li>From seperately collected data my average speed when cycling alone is about 25 km/h. (This is in heavy city traffic, fighting against cars and pedestrians...)
</ul>
<p>I bought my bike in spring 2000, so it's now 4.5 years old. Assuming the last half year was representativ of my cycling behaviour, that means my bike and I have travelled about 9.000 km. Quite a long distance.</p>

<p>The bike begins to show it's age though:</p>
<ul>
<li>The front middle gear ring has a dent somewhere which makes the chain (en?) spring off from time to time.
<li>A bearing in the right pedal is broken, resulting in the pedal getting stuck from time to time and annoying noises. 
<li>The mudgards are broken and only stay because of the large amount of mud clinging to them
<li>The coupling for the bike trailer is missing a crucial part, so i have to fix the trailer with a strong rubber band
</ul>

<p>Looks like its time to either bring the bike in for a service, or find some time and a nice place to repair it myself...</p></p>
