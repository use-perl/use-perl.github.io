<p><p>After the nice 0100000 party on Thursday (and a nice <a href="http://domm.plix.at/var/0100000/geschenke.jpg">loot</a>) I took the sleeper train to KÃÂ¶ln on Friday night. By some very lucky coincidence I got a 4-person compartment on my own - yay!</p>

<p>The next day I walked a bit through the central area of KÃÂ¶ln (around the Cathredral). Quite nice for a german city... I discovered a <a href="http://www.space-invaders.com/">space invader</a> and a fake medevial castle on a boat (some kind of museum).</p>

<p>In Brussels, I went straigth to <a href="http://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> where I met a few Perl people (Mark, Juerd, Leon, ..) at the Perl 6 talk. I spend most of the day talking with them. In the evening we had yet another birthday "party" (together with Leon) - and to my big surprise I discovered that I actually like Cherry Beer (because it doesn't taste like beer I guess)</p>

<p>Sunday night I drove with Wendy & Liz to their place, where I'm staying now. It's very nice and they are very hospitable. Yesterday Jonathan arrived from Kiev, and we did a small bicycle tour around the neighbourhood. I'm switching between working, preparing slides, chatting & playing Fluxx. Very nice...</p>

<p>That&#8217;s where I live! You should have pinged me. Well, had you known&#8230;</p>

<p>Oh well.</p>

Hm, I didn't tell dopplr that I stopped in K&#246;ln, and I don't know if you're on dopplr anyways.<br><br>But as I only stayed one hour (from 8:30 to 9:30) I doubt that meeting up would have made much sense (especially so early in the morning)<br><br>Maybe next time<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>Ah. Your &#8220;walked around&#8221; bit sounded as if you were here for longer than that, hence my exclamation.</p>

<p>No, I&#8217;m not on Dopplr&#8230; I guess I should be, huh?<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt> </p>
