<p><p>Wednesday and Friday where my first days at my new job at <a href="http://www.3united.com">3united.com</a> (the IMO slighly dumb names is deduced from the fact that the company is a result of a merger of three smaller companies). The first day involved a lot of waiting, even though I was more lucky than some <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/pepl/">other</a> people who started on the same day: I had my laptop with me, and thanks to DHCP I got an internet conenction quite fast, while they had to wait until 12:00 to get accounts on their machines.</p>

<p>Today I finally got to see some of the code I'm going to work with in future. I'm very glad it's not webstuff. But there seems to be quite a lot to refactor.</p>

<p>Thursday was "Schitag" which Samos school, so Samo, Josh and me (and a lot of other kids and parents) spend a nice sunny day at Semmering. Josh joined some other kids and a teacher for some faster action, while I snowboarded together with Samo (who skied) and a friend of his (and his father). Exept for the first slope, which was too steep (so that I had to carry Samo a bit (quite interesting, snowboarding down a medium-steep slope ("Rote Piste", for those who know) while carrying a six-year old with skies on his feet)) everything went well and we had a nice day.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will leave for another week of skiing/snowboarding, together with 4 other families with kids in the same age as ours (we know each other from kindergarden, and 3 of them are in the same class as Samo).</p>

<p>Which means that I'll be offline for a week. Yay!</p>

<p>When I come back, I will start properly at my new job, and revive CPANTS.</p>
