<h1>why TV shows should stop after season two</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>Thanks to the <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_(protocol)">mighty powers 
of the internet</a> I started to watch quite a few TV shows which I 
could never watch without the help of the aforementioned powers. 
(Because a) I don't have a TV and even if I did the german-speaking TV 
station(s) (I could receive) completely fuck up everything when broadcasting TV series: 
most of the time they only broadcast the dubbed version (argh), they 
drop episodes (because of some stupid sports event that HAS to be 
broadcasted...), the mix up the correct order, ..)</p>

<p>Anyway, the point I'm trying to make (but haven't started making yet) 
is independent of the broadcast mechanism.</p>

<p>Some of the shows I recently enjoyed are Dexter, The Big Bang Theory, 
Chuck, United States of Tara, and even (to a lesser extend) Weeds, House M.D., 
Grey's Anatomy and Desperate Housewives.</p>

<p>All of them started great. They were funny, 
suspenseful, or both. They had interesting plots, of course written for 
maximum WTFness (how often do you encounter any of this in the real 
world: serial killer working for the police, schizophrenic 
moms, hard-core nerds trying to date hot actresses, geeks turned 
superspys, genius but complete asshole doctors, hospital stuff who constantly switch partners until everyone has slept with anyone...).</p>

<p>During the first season, you get to know the main characters, the 
various support characters, and there is some halfway believable plot 
stretching through the whole season (which by the way discerns a TV 
series (where each episode has a distinct plot, e.g. your classic cop 
series or CSI) from a TV serial (which I prefere to watch..)).
</p>

<p>The second seasons might be better than the first (Dexter), or 
slightly worse (Chuck). But most things still make sense, the characters are still behaving mostly like normal people do (though normal people with little common sense), and we don't have to cringe too often when the make obviously wrong choices.</p>

<p>But at the latest starting with the third seasons, things go downhill. The 
writers have to jump through hoops to make the basic premise of the show 
hold up. They cannot allow any real change, because that would destroy 
the unique selling proposition of the show. The relationships between the 
characters cannot reach a stable state (which basically is what they all 
(we all) strive for). Things just become ridiculous. But because the 
show is a great success by now, they continue to produce more an more 
seasons until you hate all the characters for being so incredible 
stupid, for never getting out of their misery, for never resolving the 
problem that made them interesting to watch in the first season.</p>

<p>Please let Leonard get Penny and kick out Sheldon. Please let Dexter 
live happily ever after with Rita and the kids. Please let Chuck get rid 
of the Intersec but not of Sarah, and let them start a <a 
href="http://tinyurl.com/cbdgn3">Perl based startup</a>. Please! Pleeeeeaseeee!!??!?</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>PS: The only shows that can go on (nearly) forever are family based 
sitcoms (Roseanne, Malcom in the Middle), which are forced to change 
because the (kid) actors grow up and thus have different problems (plus, 
they're not based on some crazy basic idea). Or cartoons like the 
Simpsons. Or crime shows.</p>

<p>... shows that are designed to be able to be purely episodic and take place anywhere, like Dr Who.</p><p>Those, of course, are hugely rare.</p>

<p>That's another reason I like <a href="http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Main_Page" title="d-addicts.com">Japanese drama</a d-addicts.com> series. They usually have around 12 episodes, often fewer, and that's that. They're not drawn out forever. </p>

<p>huh, I think my japanese might be a bit rusty (or non-existent) - are those show available in English?
</p><p>
And this also reminds me of the nice British show <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Set_(TV_series)" title="wikipedia.org">Dead Set</a wikipedia.org> which had 6 episodes and a very final ending.
</p>

Yes, of course. They're available with English subtitles. I'll show you at the next Vienna.pm meeting.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
