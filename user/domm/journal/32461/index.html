<p><p>As you might know, the <a href="http://www.perl-workshop.de/en/2007/">9th German Perl Workshop</a> started today. In the morning, the very friendly Prof. Plate (who's working at the venue) helped me to print 140 copies of a flyer advertising <a href="http://vienna.yapceurope.org">YAPC::Europe 2007</a> which will get handed out to all of the attendees (as part of the goodie bag, which is currently lost somewhere in postal service...)</p>

<p>So I missed the start of Mark Overmeers interesting talk on CPAN6. As the WLAN wasn't working the room the tutorial happend (but it works in the main room), I fiddled with <a href="www.beryl-project.org/ ">Beryl</a> settings - (eye candy)++</p>

<p>After a very small lunch, Prof Plate did a short and funny opening speech (which is how opening speeches should be). Then JÃÂ¼rgen reminded us to take our garbage to the trashbin (and told us about several other organisational matters). Surprisingly, I was then given some time to promote YAPC::Europe 2007. After my poor (unprepared..) performance, Richard Lippman stepped up and did a proper promotion, again earning his reputation as a honorary member of Vienna.
</p>

<p>Now the proper talks are happening, and I should really pay some attention to them (even though I (hopefully) never will need to work with Excel - which is what Max is currently talking on)
</p>

<p>Oh, and some of us are hanging out in #yapc (on irc.perl.org) - come and join us for some remote conferencing</p>
