<p><p>In no particular order, I learned...</p>

<ul>
<li>to love the new features in <a href="http://act.mongueurs.net/">ACT</a>, especially the "Personal Schedule" and the fact that the regular schedule now defaults to the current day. (act_hackers)++
<li>how to cheat^Wdeal with code that cannot be covered, by inserting special comments.
<li>that it's better to only do the one talk you <a href="http://domm.plix.at/talks/die_perl_die.html">really care about</a> than to submit (and even hold) <a href="http://domm.plix.at/talks/cpants.html">boring old talks</a>.
<li>that the BBC has way too much money, so the need to spend it by blowing up cars after launching them a few hundred meters into the air on some rockets.
<li>that there are places in Copenhagen where the beer is even more expensive (and where oversized urinals are considered art (as seen in the courtyard of <i>Den Tatoverede Enke</i>))
<li>about <code>load_namespaces</code> and <code>restrict with object</code>
in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBIx-Class/">DBIx::Class</a>
<li>how to set up the 3GB flat fee no roaming umts card koki lend me, to get network despite flaky wireless (and how get into the office vpn over umts)
<li>that other people are also suffering from updating database schemas
<li>how to smuggle a few bottles of coke into the attendees dinner
<li>that other people are also suffering from the fact that firefox 3 resets you zoom-level after opening a new page, which really sucks if you present HTML slides (BTW, because of this I had to use firefox 2, which is very broken on my laptop. Of course it crashed during one of my presentations. At least the resume-feature worked, so I hadn't have to click through hundreds of slides again..)
<li>Perl is used to (re)write history (at least the history of the ~11th century(?))
<li>that to set up a login system re-using PAUSE accounts is nothing more than a dirty little hack involving https and LWP (but why was I not surprised by that?)
</ul>

<p>And of course, I was again reminded that the Perl community is a bunch of lovley and brilliant people, and that YAPC is one of my favourite times of the year.
</p>

<p>A big <B>THANK YOU</b> to the orgas, the sponsors, the speakers, the attendees, and to Larry Wall, how started it all!</p>

<p>P.S.:</p>

<p>If I was cog, here are a few more things I'd say during the opening talk, <a href="http://www.yapceurope2008.org/ye2008/talk/1361">How to get the most out of a YAPC</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Besides beer, another good way to make friends is by bringing an extension cord with multiple power plugs. Share electricity!
<li>Don't hang around (only) with your local pm group. You see them all the time, anyway. Meet new people!
</ul></p>

<h2>$@ / DESTROY issue</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Burak/">Burak</a> on 2008-08-17T22:59:30</h3>
I missed YAPC::Europe, so, making slides avaliable is nice<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) That $@ resetting issue in DESTROY seems to be a nasty bug to me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:p
