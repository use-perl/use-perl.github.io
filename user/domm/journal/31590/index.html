<p><p>Today we got new windows. I'm talking about real windows, not Vista or similar crap. When we bought our appartment a year ago, the windows where still the orginal ones from when the building was erected (~1905). The looked nice, but the wind was actually blowing through some cracks, and some windows were hard to open/close, because they were warped badly.</p>

<p>So after lots of fuzzing (do we want new windows or do we want to renovate the old ones, what kind of new windows would we want (plastic, wood, wood/alu)...) we ordered new custom made wood windows, which they started to install today.</p>

<p>They basically tore out the old windows, covering all of our appartment with dust (we covered most of our stuff with plastic sheets because we were expecting this..). It was quite cold, but luckyly they worked fast. They started at ~8:00 and were finished at ~15:00. Well, they only finished the rough bits, which means we now have the new windows in place everywhere, but they still need to finish the windowsill and plaster all of the raw brickwork.</p>

<p>Hopefully, they'll finish everything tomorrow, then we should be able to resume normal living on Wednesday (after cleaning up everything...)</p>
