<p><p>During the holidays I finally took the time to implement some time-savers:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>fetchattach.pl:</b> I read my mail using mutt, which running at a machine in the office. Most of the time I'm working from home. Everthing's fine, except if I have to view an attachment. Previously, I had to save the file to my office machine, remember the filename (or fiddle around with the mouse to copy it) and issue a longish scp command (hopefully with the correct filename / the filename still in the paste buffer)  :<br> <pre>scp domm2.zsi.at:~/somefile.bar . </pre> The whole procedure takes about 30 seconds.<br>
Thats about 20 characters. So I wrote a small script using Net::SHH and NET::SCP that looks into a special folder on my office machine, downloads everything from this folder into cwd and deletes the files from the special folder. It's about 300 characters long, and I probably typed twice as much due to debugging etc. It took me about 30 minutes. So, my investment will pay off after aprox 60 downloads, or about 2 months (at one attachment a day, which is aproximitly the amount I get). (Uhm, writing about it now probably cost me another month, or the other way round, I get a 'free' journal entry every month)<br><br>
<li><b>marking SPAM as read:</b> I get all spams caught by spamassasin delivered into one maildir called Spam (surprisingly..). Previously, I opened the folder up in the morning, at hit CTL-r until all mails where marked read (so they'll be moved to an archive folder by another script I wrote some time ago..). That was annoying. So I took some time to study some manpages and did a bit of googling to discover:
<pre>SHIFT-t new
;w r</pre>
Tag all new mail, set all tagged mail to read.<br>
Easy, saves another minute a day...<br><br>
<li><b>TODO: Script to remove spam from mailinglist I admin:</b> I assume this will mean some screenscraping and fiddling with cookies.
</ul>

<h2>That last script actually exists...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/BooK/">BooK</a> on 2005-01-12T00:00:22</h3>
<p>...but I never took the time to post it on CPAN.</p>
<p>I wrote it because clicking through 60+ spam a day in the only mailing-list I lazily admin is too much for me. So I wrote the script as an example in my series of articles (in French) about LWP and friends:
<a href="http://articles.mongueurs.net/magazines/linuxmag56.html" title="mongueurs.net">LWP</a mongueurs.net>,
<a href="http://articles.mongueurs.net/magazines/linuxmag57.html" title="mongueurs.net">Avanced LWP stuff</a mongueurs.net> and
<a href="http://articles.mongueurs.net/magazines/linuxmag58.html" title="mongueurs.net">WWW::Mechanize</a mongueurs.net>.</p>
The script you want is section 3 of the third article:
<a href="http://articles.mongueurs.net/magazines/linuxmag58.html#h3" title="mongueurs.net">Un exemple pas &#224; pas : le formulaire de Mailman</a mongueurs.net>.
<p>I'd have put it on CPAN, but then I'd have to maintain it, add useful features like interactive selection of the few non-spam mails, etc. Let me know if you think it's worth the extra work.</p>

Oh, great. I'll give it a try and report back to you.<br> <br>One funny thing: Contrary to your intended audience I need the Perl code to make sense of your (french) writing (as I don't speak french)<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
