<div class="span8">
<p><p>Last Thursday (which was also barbs birthday) was my last day at 
VeriSign after working there for nearly two years. While I was quite sad 
to leave my very nice colleagues (some of which are regulars of 
Vienna.pm, so I'll see them again) and some nice code I wrote behind, 
I'm also happy to not longer work for a big US company with all the marketing buzzwords, overhead and horrid Microsoft/Java/Oracle slowness.</p>

<p>On my last day we did a short internal development workshop where I 
gave a short presentation on Advanced Module::Build. After my talk 
(which was the last), Pepl (in the name of my colleagues) handed my a 
very nice present: a Manner-backpack full of Manner Schnitten - Yum!</p>

<p>In the evening there was a small party in my honor with ~150 
people, lasting until 8:00 in the morning (I was told, as I left at 3:00) - ok, actually it was the company christmas 
party, but it sure was a nice way to say goodbye...</p>

<p>My new job will start in Jannuary, so I now have some extra-long 
christmas holidays. Nice! Oh, and my new job will be even nicer, as I'm 
going to work together with Maros & Koki (whom you might know as some of 
the orgas of YAPC::Europe 2007).</p>

<p>Some other news: Today I presented the <a 
href="http://vienna.pm.org">Vienna.pm website</a> with a favicon.ico. 
It's just a <a href="http://perlbuzz.com/images/tpf-onion-cake.jpg">Perl 
Onion</a>, but better than nothing...</p>
