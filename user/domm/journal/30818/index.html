<p><p>I started preparing some slides for the CPANTS hackathon and implemented a
new metric as an example on how to implement new metrics. It's called
'manifest_matches_dist' and checks if the stuff listed in MANIFEST matches
what's in the distribution. 1747 dist fail this metric.</p> 

<p>Back in the Hotel, BooK helped me to get free wireless. It worked something
like this:
</p>

<ul>
<li>tunnel to one of BooKs servers through DNS
<li>which requires a threaded Perl, which I didn't have
<li>so I asked for sources for perl 5.9.4 (if I'm going to compile a new Perl,
I'll want a real new Perl)
<li>which I got from Nicholas
<li>compile perl 5.9.4 (worked without a problem)
<li>get CPANPLUS to actually use my local CPAN mirror to install some missing
modules (good that I just did a talk covering this...)
<li>get perl 5.9.4 to reuse my old site_perl because I was too lazy to
reinstall half of CPAN
<li>Issue a three-line bash command to start the tunneling (I lost it from my history and cannot remember it...)
<li>From this machine, ssh further on to feather for IRC
<li>chat a bit with BooK and Maddingue (in IRC, and not over the table we
where sharing)
<li>checking if last CPANTS run checking for the manifest_matches_dist is
finished.
<li>NOT downloading the 4.2 MB of CPANTS DB dump.
</ul>

<p>It was fun (but slow), and followed by more cider and more chatting (in real
live) until 2:00</p>

<p>On Thursday, after a quick breakfast courtesy of the supermarket around the
corner (10 Pounds is too expansive for a 20 minutes breakfast) I went to the
venue to check mail etc, but there were problems with the wireless. In fact I
got hardly any connectivity.</p>

<p>I listend to jellyfish ramble on WSDL (which I have to fight with too for
$job) and now I'm sitting in the 'Fun with POE'-talk. As the network is a bit
flakey I'm hosting an IRC daemon on my laptop which is used by Jan-Pieter to
demo his code (and by the other attendess to chat and have fun with the
bots).</p>
