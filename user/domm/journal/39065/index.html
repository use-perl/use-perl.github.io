<p><p>While cleaning up my harddisk I stumbled upon the results of my first contract, a very small and static website. I'm not sure whether I did this in the summer of 1995 or 1996, but of course is looks totally awful. There was no Perl involved, only notepad and some basic knowledge of HTML. I cannot recall how I got that contract, but I think I basically got an email from a complete stranger who said that somebody told him I could "program" a website. I think I charged the now ridiculous low fee of 1.000 Schilling (which are ~70 Euros, but even if you take inflation into acount and say that 1.000 Schilling of 1995 are now 200 Euro, it's still cheap).</p>

<p>Anyways, of course I googled for the site and found it still up and running <a href="http://www.geocentri.com/index1.htm">here</a>. It looks quite similar to my original "design", but it seems to have been created using the HTML export function of MS Word. I assume the owner of the site just took my handcrafted HTML, opened it in Word, changed minor stuff, and exported it again.</p>

<p>Hm, should I contact him and ask him if he want's an upgrade to some Catalyst based DBIC powered CMS? :-)</p></p>

<p>For being from -95, that's not too bad.</p><p>Just using the then-not-yet-a-pattern of listing all sections (well, pages in this case) and highlighting the current makes it stand out somewhat.</p>
