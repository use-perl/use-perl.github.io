<p><p>Later on Wednesday, pepl arrived from Insbruck, where he got married a few days
ago. He basically showed up, did his talk, and left for Vienna, to go on
honeymoon the next day. pepl++</p>

<p>The social event in the evening was nice, with real good food (fish!). We
played some rounds of Fluxx (first with my german cards, then with Juerds
english ones). Back at the hotel there was some more chatting, and again I went to bed way
to late.</p>

<p>I still managed to get up on time on Thursday. I really liked Andreas
Koenigs talk on new features in CPAN.pm - not only because he's an Viennes
ex-pat, but because he has this nice way of not minding that technology always
seems to fail on him during his talks. I was up after lunch for a double
feature on f**king Perl and POEing Perl. I think it showed that I basically
hate fork (and that a catchy title isn't enough for a good talk), but I still
enjoyed the talk on POE. Oh, and so that Marc Lehmann as (yet another) thing
to bitch about, I was using beryl and funky 3D window manager annoyance^w
goodness during my talk.</p>

<p>A real highlight was Jonathan Worthingtons talk on Roles and the Perl6
object system. While I knew most of the stuff he presented, he again made me
want Perl6 now! BTW, I have the feeling that the German Perl Workshop always
has the most negative tendecies towards Perl6. While the critics obviously do
have several good points (drawing resources from Perl5, not getting the design
done after 6 years, ...) I still think Perl6 is a brilliant ideas and will not
kill of Perl.</p>

<p>The evening was spent in some bavarian restaurant/beer thingy - it was ok,
but I do not fancy beer and fat food that much. Back in the hotel, demerphq
told us interesting war stories of his live as a bike messanger for the
British government, followed by a more general discussion on terrorism,
police brutality and crowd control.</p>

<p>It was already very late when we where approached by some german guy with
loads of money (and two Bentleys ...) and the ususal IT problems (data
synchronisation between different machines / handsets). We had some
interesting discussions with him on whether Perl could do anything to solve
those problems...</p>

<p>I went to bed <b>way</b> to late (either 4:00 or 5:00, I can't
remember...), so I skipped the first batch of talks. I was pleasantly surprised
that I could pay my hotel bill using my Austrian bank card (maestro), saving
me a 10 minutes walk to the next cash machine.<p>

<p>The only talk I saw on Friday was again by Jonathan, on Formal Theory.
Interesing, if a bit complex. Instead of pretending to listen to talks, I was
hanging around in the lobby, chatting with people and enyoing the sun. I also
found a great CPAN module, DBD::PgLite::MirrorPgToSQLite which makes it really
easy to dump a postgres DB into an SQLite file. I'll put this into CPANTS
when I'm back in Vienna, to make CPANTS data available to all people to play
around with it. The only I thing that annoyed me with MirrorPgToSQLite was
that it's caching the DB schema, with no way to turn this off - I think I'll
send a patch to the author...</p>

<p>I had to leave before the proper end of the workshop, thus missing Nicks
lightning talk. After several rounds of saying goodby, I left the venue and
took the tram to the railway station, where I easily cought my train home.</p>

<p>BTW, Put some bad photos up <a href="http://domm.plix.at/reisen/2007muenchen.html">here</a>...</p>
