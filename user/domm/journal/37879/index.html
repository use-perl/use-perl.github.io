<h1>TPF Grant Committee Voting Process</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>Today <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/gabor">Gabor</a> asked me on IRC how the 
<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/grants_committee">TPF Grant 
Committee</a> (GC) votes on
the submitted grants. As this might be of interest to the general
public, I reworked my reply and post it here:</p>

<p>Each quarter, the GC head^wsecretary (currently <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/ambs">Alberto SimÃÂµes</a>) sends out 
a call for proposals and collects the results. He later posts them to
the <a 
href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2008/11/2008q4_grant_proposals.html">TPF 
blog</a> for review by the community.</p>

<p>You now have the chance to read and discuss the proposals for approximately two
weeks. As the members of the GC do not know every aspect of Perl, we are very
happy for any feedback posted to the TPF blog, be it a simple "great proposal"
or a detailed critique why the proposal is utterly useless and completely sucks.
This process also gives the author of the proposal the chance to comment 
on questions raised by the community or GC members.</p>

<p>A few days before the voting deadline, the secretary sends out an 
email containing a list of all grants to the GC members (via the GC 
mailing list). Now every member gets to vote according to this 
rules:</p>

<ul>
    
    <li> vote 'NO' or 'REJECT' for those you do not want to fund
    <li> vote '0' to ABSTAIN!
    <li> vote from '1' to '5' on those you would like to see funded: ACCEPT

    <li> you can repeat votes (vote 5 on different proposals)
    <li> you do not need to use the full range
      (vote just 1 to 3, for instance)
</ul>
<p>
After the deadline, the secretary weeds out rejected proposal (<a 
href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/rules_of_operation">Rules of 
Operation</a> 5. "Grant votes require a majority of the cast votes to be in favor of the proposal being voted on.") and sorts them by the total number of vote points each proposal got (using some mighty Perl script, I presume).
</p>

<p>This results in sorted list of grant proposals, ordered by the 
combined vote of the GC members.  Beginning from the top of the list, 
proposals are declared accepted by the TPF (i.e. this is not the GC's 
job anymore), until the budget set aside by TPF for 
this quarter is used up. Proposals that would be accepted, but could not 
be funded are listed as such, so that other sponsors might step in and 
fund them. See <a href=" http://news.perlfoundation.org/2008/08/2008q3_grants_results.html">the results of the 2008 Q3 Grants</a> for an example.</p>

<p>All proposals that did not get funded might be resubmitted in the next quarter.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions on how to improve this process, feel free 
to comment here or on the <a 
href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2008/11/2008q4_grant_proposals.html">TPF 
blog</a>.</p>
