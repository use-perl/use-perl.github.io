<p><p>After a week of snowboarding (slightly hindered by too little snow, but we had fun anyway (e.g. I once carried my board up an hill for ~45 minutes, followed by some very nice deep-snow boarding through untouched snow)) I met with Barbie, Steve and their wives (or soon-to-be wives) on Sunday for a nice walk through Vienna.</p>

<p>Unfortunatly, I was a bit tired/ill, so I didn't join them for their Absinth-frenzys in Club Shabu (a very nice bar located right next to their hotel and quite near to where I live).</p>

<p>Anyway, on Monday we met up again and they joined us (Vienna.pm) for a meeting in Ronahi. After some eating, drinking, t-shirt swapping and lots of chatting, Barbie and Steve handed us over a big cheque for 3,500 Euros as funding for YAPC::Europe 2007. <a href="http://vienna.yapceurope.org/ye2007/"">Here's the photographical proof!</a></p>

<p>Oh, and we'll announce a lot of other interesting stuff regarding YAPC::Europe soon...</p></p>

Hi,
<br> <br>
Thanks for showing us around your city - it's stunning and one of the most relaxed capitals I've been too in Europe. We are really looking forward to coming back for the conference - my only regrets being that We've finalised our itinary and I wish I'd have given myself a little more time either side of YAPC to do a little more exploring, eating and drinking.
<br> <br>
In the end we took your advice and went for a ride on the wheel before we checked out of the hotel - It was a really good way to see the city, although a little creaky and unnerving in the wind with a hangover!
<br> <br><br/><br/>Thanks Again,
<br> <br><br/><br/>Steve and Lynsey

<p>Likewise, both Nicole and I had a great time and we both look forward to revisiting the city, sights, restaurants and bars. Thanks to yourself for the guided tour, and for the other Vienna.pm folks for a great start to our World Tour<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
</p><p>Photos will be online soon.</p>
