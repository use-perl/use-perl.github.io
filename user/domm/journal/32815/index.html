<p><p>Yesterday my kids and I went to a small toy store a few blocks away. They wanted to look (and maybe buy) some Lego. The shop turned out to be bigger than it looked from the outside - it only has two shop-windows facing the street, but goes quite deep into the house (three or four rooms). The had a quite decent choice of Lego sets, but the one they were looking for was missing...</p>

<p>While the kids took a closer look at the other available sets, I strolled through the store and inspected their board game section (I was looking for the board game version of "Tintenherz" (a really great book by German author Cornelia Funke)). I didn't find it, but instead I found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_%28board_game%29"
 >this</a>: A re-print of the original Civilisation board game! For a mere 20 Euros!</p>

<p>Obviously I had to buy it. Civilisation was the first "big" board game I ever played. I think I was ~15 when I first played it. It's a very cool game (no dice, all randomness comes from some cards with goods you have to draw, which might include a "bad card" (famine, revolt, ..)). Played properly, it takes ~8 hours, most of which is spent haggling with other players over goods and persuading them not to invade your areas.</p>

<p>Now I only need to find some people to play with (up to seven players)...</p></p>

<h2>I'll play</h2>

I'll play! Too we don't live on the same Continent <br>

<p>
I grew up playing Conquest of the Empire and Axis (of course). But we could never get our grubby little hands on a copy of this. It looks like great fun, I've always loved the computer version of it.

<h2>BOF?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barbie/">barbie</a> on 2007-03-29T07:07:35</h3>
I wonder how much mileage there is in a Board Games BOF at YAPC::Europe? We usually play card games, but  I could probably fit Carcassonne in my bag. Plus now you've reminded me, I may well have to hunt down some games to take home with me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Good idea.
<p>
I see you already added it to the <a href="http://vienna.yapceurope.org/ye2007/wiki?node=BoardGamesBOF" title="yapceurope.org">wiki</a yapceurope.org>, so I'll do the same<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
