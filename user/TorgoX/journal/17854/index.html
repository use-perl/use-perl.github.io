<p>Dear Log,

<p>So I went to the diner today to read this manuscript that I Must
Read, which requires actual concentration and an absence of distractions.

<p>The place is empty.  I sit down and start to read.  All is well.

<p>But within a minute or two, a woman with a ~8-year-old kid (who's
wearing one of those karate bathrobes) comes in and sits down in the
booth right behind me. They begin playing I SPY WITH MY LITTLE EYE very
loudly. And I think maybe the kid is kinda dense.

<p>Mother:  I SPY WITH MY LITTLE EYE... SOMETHING GLOWING.
<br>Kid: A DOOR!!!
<br>Mother: NOW THAT'S SILLY, DO DOORS GLOW?
<br>Kid: A BANANA!!!
<br>Mother: NO!  IT'S THE "OPEN" NEON SIGN HERE.  OKAY, NOW YOU DO ONE.
<br>Kid: I SPY WITH MY LITTLE EYE... A BASKETBALL PLAYER ON TV!!!
<br>Mother: THAT'S NOT HOW YOU PLAY IT!

<p>This continued for LONGER THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE.  I swear I'm not
making this up -- the above were their EXACT (AND LOUD) WORDS.

<p>I was not in my happy place as I tried to think of a perfect way to
explain the relationship between callstacks and call trees while
this wall all going on.

<p>I've figured out now that all the times I've been at the diner
and gotten work done, were times I brought headphones and a laptop full
of mp3s to drown out all noise.

<p>I gave up and went home.  Tomorrow,
I'll try going to
<a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-02-11/library1.JPG">the local public library.</a>
I used to get great work
done at the library in
<a href="http://www.binginit.com/sburke/juneau/wrappers/201.htm">Douglas,</a> where they had big Comfy Chairs.
But the library here is more cramped for space, so
they have more standard library furniture.


<p>Ahwell, if not there, then I'll go to
<a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-01-03a/thai_chart1.JPG">the
Thai restaurant</a> and lurk in a back booth and read.
With mp3s and headphones.

<p>Meanwhile, since this manuscript-reading is a paying gig, and urgent,
all my other Perl stuff (Pod::* etc) is on hold until I'm done with
this, about two weeks from now.
