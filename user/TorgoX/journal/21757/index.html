<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;Oregon represented gay-rights groups' best hope for victory, but an amendment [to the constitution of each state] banning same-sex marriage prevailed there with 57 percent of the votes, leaving some activists in tears. Similar bans won by larger margins in Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Ohio and Utah.
<p>[...]In the four Southern states, the amendments received at least three-quarters of the votes, including 86 percent in Mississippi.&raquo;
<p>--<a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/ap/20041103/ap_on_el_st_lo/eln_gay_marriage">"Conservatives Cheer Gay Marriage
Bans"</a></blockquote>

I wonder if these states could be encouraged to (re-)ban interracial marriage too -- I think
it would be a deeply comedic event event if the USA would be quite explicit in "sending
a message" to the world that the majority of the country stands more for
church-drunk sanctimony and
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/user/brianenigma/177623.html">"traditional
values"</a> than anything as vulgar as "what harm would it do?" or "live and let live" or
equality under the law.  Nope, better not risk anything as dangerous as equality --
it's much better to just roll backwards into the past.  I'm sure some holy man could be
found to disaffirm race-mixing (the ones who yowled about it upto the 1970s might still be around), then the theocracy will be made absolutely incandescently clear.
<p>Also, might as well take away the right of women to vote.  Just in case.  Because the Bible told me to, and Freedom is on the march.</p>
