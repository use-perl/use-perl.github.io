<p>Dear Log,
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,627368,00.html">Marmite</a> is now a hundred years old.  And as with anything that survives a century in good shape, I felt obliged to try it at least once.  So I found a tiny little jar of it at the supahmarket, selling for about three times what it'd go for in the UK.  I got it home, and spread it thinly on buttered toast.  Mmmmm funky!
<p>I get the impression it tastes different to everyone -- not surprising for a substance (industrially derived "yeast extract") that was not (not by a long shot!) on the menu of any of our primate/primitive hyoo-mon ancestors.  Well, to me it tastes like beef gravy.  People say "no, that's Bovril!".  No, really, Marmite tastes to me like beef gravy.

<p>In other news, the Guardian describes <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,627073,00.html">a real-life enactment</a> of the play that would have been written if Beckett, Sartre, and Neil Simon had ever collaborated ... with the Taliban!

Marmite...now, I know that Vegemite is brewery waste; is that what "yeast extract" means here?
<p>
Beef gravy, eh?  One time I had a cold and mistook a bowl of turkey gravy for a bowl of refried bean dip, eating about half the bowl along with a bag of chips.
</p><p>
Any comparisons between Marmite and Vegemite?</p>

Marmite, Promite and Vegemite are all roughly the same thing: a yeast extract (er, "brewery waste").
They're all rich in the B-vitamins (which makes them an excellent part of an effective hangover cure, along with copious amounts of water).
<p>
I've got a jar of Marmite at home that I occasionally use.  Truth be told, the three have a very similar taste, although Marmite is the least tasty of the three.  I'd rank them as follows (mostly from memory):
</p><ol>
<li>Vegemite</li>
<li>Promite</li>
<li>Marmite</li>
</ol>
That distinction may be moot, since all three have a taste similar to condensed solidified soy sauce.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

note to self: remember to take marmite and crackers next time you have a headache...

Great Chao, I'm just getting used to non-condensed *liquid* soy sauce...!
<p>
I shall make sure to keep a one-hundred-foot distance between myself and any -mite substances, then.</p>
