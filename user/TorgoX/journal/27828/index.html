<p>Dear Log,
<blockquote>&laquo;<b><i><a href=
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/appendix/notes.html#ampersands-in-uris"
>B.2.2: Ampersands in URI attribute values</a></i></b>

<br><br>The URI that is constructed when a form is submitted</a> may
be used as an anchor-style link (e.g., the href attribute for the
<sampA</samp> element). Unfortunately, the use of the "&amp;"
character to separate form fields interacts with its use in SGML
attribute values to delimit character entity references. For example,
to use the URI "http://host/?x=1<b>&amp;</b>y=2" as a linking URI, it must be
written &lt;A href="http://host/?x=1<b>&amp;#38;</b>y=2"&gt; or &lt;A
href="http://host/?x=1<b>&amp;amp;</b>y=2"&gt;.

<br><br>We recommend that HTTP server implementors, and in particular,
CGI implementors support the use of ";" in place of "&amp;" to save
authors the trouble of escaping "&amp;" characters in this
manner.&raquo;</blockquote>

<p>It's not a new recommendation either.  It's been there since <a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc1866.txt">1995</a>.
  CGI.pm supports it, but I doubt I've ever seen it actually used anywhere.</p>

Part of the trouble is the lack of support.  I always use URI.pm to generate URLs with query strings correctly, but it insists on producing ampersands.  I know, I should submit a patch.

<p>The other part of the problem is the fact that our tools are <a href="http://happygiraffe.net/blog/archives/2005/11/26/the-wrong-defaults/" title="happygiraffe.net">fundamentally broken and insecure</a happygiraffe.net>.

There's already a patch for URI, but the bug its attached was submitted prior to the W3C XHTML recommendation, and has a low priority. I submitted a meta bug. Additional lobbying might help, though.

<p>I don't think that's a URI.pm bug, since escaping the query string is only relevant when it's being used as an attribute value.  I'd say it's a bug in whatever is generating the HTML code.</p>

<p>(Unless you mean the patch changes it to emit semi-colons instead of ampersands, in which case, I apologize, because you're correct.)</p>

Yes, that's exactly what I was referring to.  I reckon that there should be a global variable in URI::_query or something to set which one you would prefer.  I haven't looked at the relevant bug yet to see if that's how it's done.

<p>Funny, <a href="http://weblog.philringnalda.com/2005/11/28/appendix-c-why-hast-thou-forsaken-me#comment-11813" title="philringnalda.com">I complained about that just recently</a philringnalda.com> &#8211; PHP still isn&#8217;t configured to accept semicolonised query strings by default. It&#8217;s by far the biggest offender.</p>

<p>Maybe I should take a look at what the Rails and Django folk are doing and complain at them too.</p>

<p>Perl stuff is <em>mostly</em> good about this.</p>



<h2>OAI</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2005-12-07T05:03:01</h3>
I wrote some OAI (Open Archives Initiative) code for Slashdot, for a certain search site to use to get data from us.  OAI is XML, and part of the spec is to pass a "resumption token" for when the results list is incomplete (as tends to happen, since you don't want to put all the Slashdot data in one result list).<br><br>So for simplicity, I used the query string made to make the request as the resumption token, with the counter incremented.  This meant encoding &amp; as &amp;, of course.  The search site people thought the bug was mine, but it was in their code.  I convinced them of this, thankfully, because that was easier than changing my code.  But I shouldn't have used &amp; in the resumption token (I have to use it in the query string, as per the OAI spec, but the spec allows the token to be anything).<br>
