<p>Dear Log,
<p>A mostly creepy article:
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/women/story/0,3604,680667,00.html">"'I don't come here for the conversation'"</a>, subtitled "Why do ordinary, respectable men visit prostitutes? These interviews with customers at Australian brothels provide a rare insight into how some men see not just sex, but women".

<p>You don't know Sean vewwy well do you?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I keep waiting for a brothel to open up a 'superstore' so that these guys can pick up a 6-pack of beer, some bread, milk and cheese along with 30 minutes of 'service'. I mean, treating sex the ways these guys do it's amusing they don't see the connection between their feelings of ineptitude and women not being satisfied. I don't have much hope for this ever changing since both sides of the equation collude to ensure its perpetuation.</p>

<p>The computer guy was just as pathetic, imprisoned and victimised by a lifetime of cultural stereotyping as many geeks are but claim otherwise since they have the lie of 'digital enlightenment' to puff up their chest. I considered opening a brothel for geeks which would feature a lara croft among other female icons of the geek world since it would be hugely popular...The Byte Ranch<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>The only part I thought scary was the repeating theme of men not wanting to use condoms at the brothel. duh.</p>

<p>I know that's one of your (many!) favourite theories: all male geeks are disfonctional, socially impaired, loners who can't get laid despite all their pathetic efforts. But really, facts seem to contradict you. Most members (pun not intended) of the Perl community are happily married/living in sin, some even with kids (hi Pudge, stay away from this discussion, you're too busy for this now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;--). In fact very few seem to fit the typical geek stereotype (no names!).</p>
<p>BTW what's your theory about female geeks?</p>

<p>My experience is that the Perl people are quite atypical.  Most other
kinds of programmers I've interacted with are much more likely to be
like something out of <cite>Confederacy of Dunces</cite>.

</p><p>You let 'em write a dozen lines of COBOL and they think they're the Messiah.
Stand in awe of their searing Usenet rants! Worship their infantile idea of
debate! (Namely: "<em>You</em> have opinions, <em>I</em> have facts" and, when in doubt, repeat it louder this time)
Admire their firm conviction that their way is the only way!  Listen to their cooing about how you've <em>GOT</em> to read <cite>Cryptonomicon</cite>!  Stay awake as they harangue you uselessly about software patents!</p>

<p>You may have missed that half of the men in the brothel were married. Also, I said 'many' but not 'all'. Just because you can find someone to marry you doesn't mean you don't have completely fucked up ideas about women. The perl community is no poster child for enlightened men. You're just being a typical geek while believing WYSIWYG which never works with people....though it would be nice if it did<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) </p>

Is there a community that's a poster child for enlightened <i>anyone</i>? It's been my experience that the best you can hope for is the odd individual here or there. Communities, as a whole, seem to get stupider and less enlightened the more people that are in them.

<em>Is there a community that's a poster child for enlightened anyone?</em>

<p>Yes, I've always thought that the problem of how to increase the
intelligence of groups is a for more serious and urgent problem than how
to increase the intelligence of individuals.</p>

<p>Oh, I don't know if quantity and volume are directly correlated with intelligence as the KKK is a small group of people with a consistently stupid population since stupidity is the entrance fee.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I have heard guys around these parts ask why there aren't more women in technology then proceed to talk about porn then say that marrying an intelligent woman proves they are all for treating women as equals in technology soo.....even on the individual level there seems to be a huge gap in understanding on what enlightenment in this particular area really means.</p>

Never said a small group is a guarantee of enlightenment, just that a large one (for values of large in excess of 1 person sometimes) are usually a guarantee of, well, stupidity, ignorance, and/or boorish behaviour.

<p>Can't say that I found the article particularly shocking. "You aren't implying that men who visit prostitutes are emotional underdeveloped with  adolescent opinions about sex, are you?" The poor bastards interviewed didn't seem to be expressing anything different than a <i>Porky's</i> film. I'd rather have these numbnuts screwing hookers than marrying someone just for sex. It's a shame some of these clods do both. A good friend of mine once said of sex: "everyone wants to dominate and be dominated at some point in their lives." I have yet to find a more succinct phrasing of the complex behaviors  associated with human sexuality (with all due respect to Prof. Buffet's <i>Why Don't We Get Drunk and Screw</i>).</p>
