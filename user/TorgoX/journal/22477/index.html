<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;[...] And there is something about AI that many philosophers find
off-putting--if not repugnant to reason, then repugnant to their
aesthetic sense.

<p>This clash of vision was memorably displayed in a historic debate at
Tufts University in March of 1978, staged, appropriately, by the Society
for Philosophy and Psychology. Nominally a panel discussion on the
foundations and prospects of Artificial Intelligence, it turned into a
tag-team rhetorical wrestling match between four heavyweight ideologues:
Noam Chomsky and Jerry Fodor attacking AI, and
<a href="http://www.robotwisdom.com/ai/ilsmemoir.html">Roger Schank</a> and Terry
Winograd defending. Schank was working at the time on programs for
natural language comprehension, and the critics focussed on his scheme
for representing (in a computer) the higgledy-piggledy collection of
trivia we all know and somehow rely on when deciphering ordinary speech
acts, allusive and truncated as they are. Chomsky and Fodor heaped scorn
on this enterprise, but the grounds of their attack gradually shifted in
the course of the match.

<p>It began as a straightforward, "first
principles" condemnation of conceptual error--Schank was on one fool's
errand or another--but it ended with a striking concession from Chomsky:
it just might turn out, as Schank thought, that the human capacity to
comprehend conversation (and more generally, to think) was to be
explained in terms of the interaction of hundreds or thousands of jerry-
built gizmos--pseudo-representations, one might call them--but that
would be a shame, for then psychology would prove in the end not to be
"interesting."

<p>There were only two interesting possibilities, in
Chomsky's mind: psychology could turn out to be "like physics"--its
regularities explainable as the consequences of a few deep, elegant,
inexorable laws--or psychology could turn out to be utterly lacking in
laws, in which case the only way to study or expound psychology would be
the novelist's way (and he much preferred Jane Austen to Roger Schank,
if that were the enterprise).

<p>A vigorous debate ensued among the panelists and audience, capped by
an observation from Chomsky's MIT colleague, Marvin Minsky, one of the
founding fathers of AI, and founder of MIT's AI Lab: "I think only a
humanities professor at MIT could be so oblivious to the third
interesting possibility: psychology could turn out to be like
engineering." [...]&raquo;
