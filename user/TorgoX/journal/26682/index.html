<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;They looked as bedraggled as their grueling ride would suggest: 13
hours on the commandeered bus driven by a 20-year-old man. Watching
bodies float by as they tried to escape the drowning city. Picking up
people along the way. Three stops for fuel. Chugging into Reliant
Park, only to be told initially that they could not spend the
night.&raquo;<blockquote

Astrodome"</a></blockquote></blockquote>
Oh those looters!  Don't they know you should go thru proper (lethal) channels?

<p>Meanwhile, back in Temporary Abandonment Zone:
<blockquote
>&laquo;But the authorities don't usually fail so spectacularly. Failure at
this level requires sustained effort. The deepening of the divide
between the haves and have nots, the stripping away of social
services, the defunding of the infrastructure, mean that this
disaster--not of weather but of policy--has been more or less
what was intended to happen, if not so starkly in plain
sight.
<p>[...]
Many of the stories we hear about sudden natural disasters are about
the brutally selfish human nature of the survivors, predicated on the
notion that survival is, like the marketplace, a matter of
competition, not cooperation. Cooperation flourishes anyway.&raquo;<blockquote
