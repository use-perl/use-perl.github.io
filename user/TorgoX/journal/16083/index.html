<p>Dear Log,
<p>So I got <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735712018">Zeldman's book</a>,
<cite>Designing With Web Standards</cite>, a.k.a. the Shocking Bad Hat book.  It's full of really great content; but the tone of the prose makes me want to go lick electrical cables.  Grah.

<p>Okay, okay, this is my impression of Jeffrey Zeldman looking at his morning cup of coffee:
"This bold coffee consumable offers just the kind of compelling
flavor taste that today's New Media designers demand."

<p>And this is my impression of me looking at my morning (2pm) cup of tea:
"<a href="http://www.suck.com/daily/96/10/23/daily.html">VergangenheitsbewÃÂ¤ltigung!</a>
<a href="http://www.blairmag.com/blair3/">VergangenheitsbewÃÂ¤ltigung!</a>
<a href="http://physics.syr.edu/courses/vrml/electromagnetism/">VergangenheitsbewÃÂ¤ltigung!</a>
<a href="http://pst.rbma.com/content/Zippy_the_Pinhead">YOW!!!</a>"

<p>Luckily, I can recover from the Shocking Bad Hat's prose book by reading the other thing the postie brought me from Amazon today: 
<cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/014100195X/">A Massive Swelling: Celebrity Reexamined As a Grotesque, Crippling
Disease and Other Cultural Revelations</a></cite> by Cintra Wilson.

<p>I'm merrily unpacking things, and thus getting over the move from Juneau to Ketchikan as if it were all a bad flu.  The other important part of this move-recovery process is figuring out the quirks of the appliances that came with the place.  Gotta slam the dishwasher door or it won't click shut; and its timer is broken so it'll sit in rinse cycle forever until you nudge it into the drying cycle.  Therein is a metaphor for, oh, whatever.

<p>I should release these modules I've been hacking at lately.  I repeat: <a href="http://www.weebl.jolt.co.uk/go.php?date=2003-11-25">Grah.</a></p>

I agree. Great content, but after about a third of the book I felt that I had got the message: <em>Standards good, old style bad</em>, and hoped that finally he would get to the meat of it and "show some code". That never really happened, so I handed the book to out local design people, hoping that they would get something out of it.<p>
I feel that there is a need for something like this, but with a more technical target, and preferably more cook-book'ish<br>Any authors out there who could write it? Or has someone already written a HTML and CSS Cookbook?</p>

<p>Yeah, I've had the thing barely three days now and I'm already thinking about donating it to one of the local public/university libraries.  I have some designer friends who might like it, but now that I think of it, they've been using semantic markup for years before this Fear Of A Black Hat book came out.</p>
