<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;As Mr. Hacker and others have documented, over the past three decades the lives of ordinary Americans have become steadily less secure, and their chances of plunging from the middle class into acute poverty ever larger. Job stability has declined; spells of unemployment, when they happen, last longer; fewer workers receive health insurance from their employers; fewer workers have guaranteed pensions.
<p>Some of these changes are the result of a changing economy. But the underlying economic trends have been reinforced by an ideologically driven effort to strip away the protections the government used to provide. For example, long-term unemployment has become much more common, but unemployment benefits expire sooner. Health insurance coverage is declining, but new initiatives like health savings accounts (introduced in the 2003 Medicare bill), rather than discouraging that trend, further undermine the incentives of employers to provide coverage.&raquo;

<p>Also, did you know that the US economy being wrecked is TOTALLY NOT because of runaway military deficit-spending to the tune of like a squillion dollars?  <p>No, it's because Becky-Lynne had to pay for her hospital stay with her MBNA card.  Everyone knows this.  It's totally a true fact from science/faith.
