<p>To: <em>[My 11-year-old cousin]</em>
<br>From: <em>[me]</em>
<br>Subject: Fucik

<p>It recently occurred to me that Your musical education cannot be
complete without a consideration of the Czech composer, Julius Fucik.

<p>He was born in Prague in 1872, in the Bohemia/Moravia state of the
Austro-Hungarian empire. He seems to have grown up speaking German,
Czech, and Hungarian. His name is pronounced YOO-lee-uss FOO-chick.

<p>When he was a teenager, he joined the imperial military as a musician --
the empire was big on brass bands and whatnot -- and studied with the
composer Antonin Dvorak (who later came to the US and composed the "From
The New World" Symphony, and whose distant cousin Augustin Dvorak
designed the keyboard layout that made it possible for me to keep typing
after years of using the QWERTY layout gave me almost-permanent
neuromuscular damage).

<p>Fucik wrote a new piece (whether march, polka, or other peppy fun
things) every few months, and was famous as a band leader. He moved to
Berlin in the early 1910s to start a music publishing company (the
equivalent of a record label at the time); but war broke out, and in the
devastation, he died, along with millions of other Europeans, and the
existences of the Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and German empires. The
lands of the Austro-Hungarian empire were carved up into ethnic nations,
and Prague ended up in Czechoslovakia, and then the Czech Republic.

<p>Fucik's hundred-odd compositions have been mostly forgotten. In the
Czech Republic, his marches are considered popular Czech "patriotic"
music, which is odd since no such country even existed until after he
was dead. Outside of the Czech Republic, only one work of his is well
known -- opus #68, which he wrote when he was about 25. He titled it in
German: "Einzug der Gladiatoren" ("Enter the Gladiators"). It is now
normally known just as "the clown music".
<a href="http://interglacial.com/user/sburke/pub/midi/circus.mid">Here</a> is a MIDI file of it.

<p>The lesson, I suppose, is that crazy music and European history are just
two sides of the same coin. </p>

Ridley Scott should have used that piece as the theme music for <i>Gladiator</i>.  I don't know what he was thinking -- commissioning a new piece of theater music when there was a perfectly good composition (without any ASCAP licensing issues!) that evokes the image of gladitorial combat....
