<p>Dear Log,
<p>When linguists gossip:
When linguists gossip:

<p>"You know what I can't stand?  All those people who work on Hawaiian, what with their FONTS!"
<p>"Oh God yes.  Such CRYBABIES."
<p>"Waaa, waaaa, we have ONE accent mark on vowels, and glottal stop symbol!"
<p>"And of course they would rather die a painful death than write that accent with the things in Latin-1.  I mean, God forbid they should use an acute, or a circumflex, no no, they HAVE to have it be a macron!"
<p>"Because it would be the end of the world if they used the same fonts as anyone else.  And their glottal stop symbol is just a single openquote but, again, they can't just use a backtick, or even a proper single openquote character.  No, they have to stamp their little feet until someone makes them a separate font..."
<p>"Separate and incompatible with Latin-1!"
<p>"Well obviously."
<p>"I hate their whole sanctimonious thing about how their whole spelling system is a tradition handed down by the ancestors since the dawn of time because it's, what, sixty years old?  seventy?"
<p>"I got shoes older than that supposed 'tradition'."
<p>"Those people just annoy me."
<p>"They're awful awful awful."
<p>"I hate them SO MUCH."
<p>"They're a million times worse than Hitler."
<p>"A billion times."
<p>"A European-billon times!"
<p>"SO MUCH."
<p>"I hope some law gets passed that forbids them from even using Roman script at all.  Serves 'em right."
<p>"Exactly, and instead they should have to use Cherokee syllabics"
<p>"Alternating with Arabic script"
<p>"And only in green ink."
<p>"SMELLY green ink that SMEARS!"
<p>"Serves 'em right."
<p>"Are we out of Stoli ALREADY?"

I guess that is an example of Hawaiian shirtiness.
