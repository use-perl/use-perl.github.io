<div class="span8">
<p>Dear Log,

<p>After the better part of a decade's procrastination, I have finally
switched over to Unix (specifically Fedora Linux) as my main platform.
The <a
href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2004/12/21/tool_cruft.html">change</a>
has been mostly uneventful.

<p>Moving and adapting all my various config files led me to
retrospect retrospectively on my bits of config fun.

<p>Here are the highlights of my Firefox config (beyond
just using 
<a
href="https://addons.update.mozilla.org/extensions/?application=firefox">lots
of wonderful extensions</a>):

In Firefox, pull up about:config and then set these:
<ul><li>image.animation_mode &#8658; "once"
<li>browser.chrome.favicons &#8658; false
<li>browser.chrome.site_icons &#8658; false
<li>javascript.options.strict &#8658; true</ul>

The first one lets animated GIFs cycle only once, then they stop
forever, dammit.  The second and third ones turn off use of favicons
(like the little camel for this site).  And the last one throws
JavaScript into scrict mode (which is actually more like Perl "use
warnings;" than "use strict;").  It's a must if you're writing any
JavaScript; also you get to occasionally open your JS console and laff
at how bad the JavaScript code on most web sites is.

<p>More on site icons: 
I also have, in my
~/.mozilla/firefox/[goo].default/chrome/userChrome.css file, this bit
of XUL-CSS to get tabs to absolutely have no icons, and to have
smaller fonts:

<pre>
@namespace url("http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"); /* set default namespace to XUL */

/* Kill all tab icons, no matter what */
.tabbrowser-tabs .tab-icon {
  display: none;
}

/* Change color of normal tabs */
tab {
   color: gray !important;
   /* background-color: #ff0000 !important; */

   font-family: "Small Fonts", Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif !important;
   font-size: 70% !important;
}

/* Change color of active tab */
tab[selected="true"] {
   color: black !important;
   /* background-color: #00ff00 !important; */

   font-family: "Small Fonts", Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif !important;
   font-size: 70% !important;
   font-weight: normal !important;
}
</pre>


<p>Meanwhile, in my .emacs.config ...

<pre>
(defun kill-ring-save-line () "Copy the current line to the kill ring"
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (beginning-of-line)
    (kill-ring-save
     (progn (beginning-of-line) (point) )
     (progn (end-of-line) (point) )
     )
    )
  )

(global-set-key "\M-k" 'kill-ring-save-line)


;; and while I'm showing off:
(global-set-key "\M-o" 'occur)
(global-set-key "\M-m" 'man)
(global-set-key "\M-p" 'cperl-perldoc)

  (defun dos-newlines () 
    "sets the buffer-file-coding-system to undecided-dos; changes the buffer
    by invisibly adding carriage returns"
    (interactive)
    (set-buffer-file-coding-system 'undecided-dos nil))
  (defun unix-newlines () 
    "sets the buffer-file-coding-system to undecided-unix; changes the buffer
    by invisibly removing carriage returns"
    (interactive)
    (set-buffer-file-coding-system 'undecided-unix nil))
  (defun mac-newlines () 
    "sets the buffer-file-coding-system to undecided-mac; may change the buffer
    by invisibly removing carriage returns"
    (interactive)
    (set-buffer-file-coding-system 'undecided-mac nil))
</pre>

<p>Now if only I could figure out how to alias control-; to
control-x.

<h2>pushing your technology choices on other people</h2>

Reading the article you linked to got me thinking about one of the truly hateful geek tendencies: responding to a problem by proposing a completely different toolset. (Where "toolset" depends on the domain under discussion...)

<p>For instance, I say: "I've got a working CGI::Application app but am trying to get it to do X and am having problems. Has anyone done this before?" Someone responds, "Well, if you used webapp framework Y you could do it so much easier...."</p>

<p>...yeah, and if my aunt had testicles she'd be my uncle. Sure, I'll invest days and days to relearn a whole bunch of configurations, ideologies and quirks just to get back to where I am right now. And spend a few more weeks to rewrite all my applications use this fantastic new framework, a few more to fix all the bugs I introduced. And then in a few months I'll say, "I've got a working Y app but am trying to get it to do X..." and the whole process will start again. Hooray!</p>

<p> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22there's+always+a+but%22" title="google.com">But</a google.com>. That's how we wind up changing technologies, isn't it? Otherwise Perl probably never would have replaced the shell/awk/sed/etc. toolset without Randal and Larry enlightening sysadmins on usenet. (Or maybe it would have done so much more slowly.)</p>

<p>So it certainly has a place, even in public. I guess I just wish people would think about these things before pushing their kool-aid. (Not much of a rant conclusion, eh?)</p>
