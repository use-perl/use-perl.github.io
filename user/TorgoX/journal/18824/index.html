<p>Dear Log,

<p><blockquote>&laquo;Not for our eyes were the notes that showed White
House staffers taking two-hour meetings with Christian fundamentalists,
where they passed off bogus social science on gay marriage as if it were
holy writ and issued fiery warnings that "the Presidents [sic]
Administration and current Government is engaged in cultural,
economical, and social struggle on every level -- this to a group whose
representative in Israel believed herself to have been attacked by
witchcraft unleashed by proximity to a volume of Harry Potter.

<p>Most of all, apparently, we're not supposed to know the National
Security Council's top Middle East aide consults with apocalyptic
Christians eager to ensure American policy on Israel conforms with <a
href="http://www.armageddonbooks.com/218revelation.html">their sectarian
doomsday scenarios.</a>

<p>The problem is not that George W. Bush is discussing policy with people
who press right-wing solutions to achieve peace in the Middle East, or
with devout Christians.  It is that he is discussing policy with
Christians who might not care about peace at all -- at least until the
rapture.&raquo;
<p>--<a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0420/perlstein.php"
 >"The Jesus Landing Pad:</a>
Bush White House checked with rapture Christians before latest Israel move"</blockquote>

I think he should've given equal time to the
<a href="http://www.subgenius.com/bigfist/fistclutch.html">Church of
Bob</a> people.

<p>Also, I want voodoo economics to be officated
<a href="http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/vodou/spirits5.html">by actual voodooists.</a>
Let's put the v&eacute;v&eacute;s to work... for the economy!

<p>But for the lack of these wise counsels, Bush's
"you totally wouldn't believe it" God-(w)rap has stayed stuck
in a mode of <a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/politics/singer.html">adolescent</a>
obscurantism, richly feeding his whole administration's
obsessive secrecy.  It's a great
modus vivendi for your average West Texas
cult leader or Unabomber, but not so great for, well,
a <a href="http://www.csun.edu/user/hcfll004/jefflet.html">government.</a>  With nuclear weapons.

<p>WHERE'S MY VOODOO BALLOT?</p>

OMG people have beliefs that have been around for thousands of years, and shared by almost every US President, sound the alarm!

<p>Most of the presidents also basically believed that black people were congenitally retarded goons -- but that's hardly an advertisement for that perspective.  Sturgeon's law applies to presidents as well as to religions.</p>

Yes, too bad you've chosen with the 90% on both counts.
