<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;"Children's lives have been evolving in a way that
mirrors the characteristics of the lives of criminals in prison. They, too, have a roof
over their heads, regular meals and entertainment provided for them, but they are
not free to go out. But children are not criminals." 
<p>[...and much later...]
<p>Given Hillman's personal experience, along with his work on the effects of traffic, you
gird yourself for a homily about the virtues of public transport (like a low-fat diet,
high on the yeah, yeah scale). He doesn't deliver. On the contrary, he points out that,
per passenger mile, public transport is only 20% less energy-intensive than travelling
in a car. The bicycle is his panacea, and his adult life has witnessed a dramatic decline
in its use. Fifty years ago, cycle mileage exceeded car mileage. Now it's the other way
around. While most children own a bicycle, few are allowed to use it as a means of
transport, which Hillman finds deplorable, because cycling - when it's used as a daily
means of transport - is not only a terrific way of keeping fit, but also makes the world
more accessible to children. Compared with walking, bicycling has the potential to
expand a person's geographical catchment area 10- to 15-fold. &raquo;<p
>--<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,823111,00.html">"A chain reaction:</a>For 30 years Mayer Hillman has been busily turning conventional political thinking on its head. From road safety to renewable energy, he has come up with solutions that are hard to dismiss.  Which is probably why you've never heard of him"</blockquote></p>
