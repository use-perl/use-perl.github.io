<p>Dear Log,

<p><blockquote
>&laquo;After years of not investing in the country's infrastructure, this
could be the first consequence of misspending. The US telephone
systems, bridges, railroads and highways are in poor shape. The
authorities were told 25 years ago that the New Orleans levees could
not withstand a storm of Katrina's magnitude, but a city that votes
Democratic wasn't going to get the necessary allocations to refortify
the works. Bush turned down foreign aid because America is the giver,
not the receiver, but they are also not talking much in the US news
media about what we can't afford and what resources aren't available
because of the war in Iraq.

<p>We are becoming like the countries we criticise and pity, places where
the state and the society have less and less to do with each other. We
are on our own, but then black people have always known
that.&raquo;<blockquote
>--<a href=
"http://www.guardian.co.uk/katrina/story/0,16441,1561997,00.html"
>"We are on our own"</a>:
"In the US, white people can't imagine black people who are just like
them"</blockquote></blockquote>

<p><blockquote
>&laquo;The words "homeland security" now have a terribly hollow ring in the
anarchic south: 35% of Louisiana's National Guard is serving in Iraq,
where four out of every 10 soldiers are guardsmen. And recruiting is
down because people fear being sent to Iraq. The priority given to law
and order seems a troubling inverse reflection of what happened after
the fall of Baghdad. Is it really more important to use deadly force
against looters than to deliver humanitarian aid
effectively?&raquo;<blockquote
>--<a href=
"http://www.guardian.co.uk/katrina/story/0,16441,1561993,00.html"
>"Blaming Bush"</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<p><blockquote
>&laquo;If we can't focus properly on the immediate and long-term causes of
communal violence, we'll get ample opportunity in the future to
appropriate someone else's misery for our own failed
ideologies.&raquo;<blockquote
>--<a href=
"http://www.livejournal.com/user/substitute/993229.html"
>"Looting: My story."</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Tomorrow begins <a href=
"http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/09/02/nagin.transcript/"
>here</a>.
So call me when it's over -- I'm going to go find a glacier to hide under.</p>
