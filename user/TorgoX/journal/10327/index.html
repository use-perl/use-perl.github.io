<p>Dear Log,
<p>This article is so bathetic that I sense I must include it all:

<blockquote><b>Entertainment: MTV apologizes for Gandhi lampoon</b>
<br>The Associated Press 

<p>NEW DELHI, India (January 31, 2003 11:58 a.m. EST) - MTV US apologized Friday for offending Indians by airing in the United States a show that lampooned India's revered independence leader, Mohandas K. Gandhi.

<p>"MTV US apologizes if we have offended the people of India and the memory of Mahatma Gandhi," the music channel said in a statement faxed to news media. "Mahatma" means great soul and is an honorific often attached to Gandhi's name.

<p>Nearly 150 lawmakers and political activists had fasted at Gandhi's memorial Thursday to protest against the MTV show they said insulted Gandhi.

<p>The show, <a href="http://www.mtv.com/onair/clone_high/">"Clone High, USA,"</a> has not been aired in India, but a newspaper report about it has upset many Indians who revere Gandhi as a hero and an advocate of nonviolence.

<p>"Clone High, USA" introduces a character called G-Man - a fictitious Gandhi clone who wears dangly earrings, eats junk food and is the ultimate party animal.

<p>MTV US said it had "utmost respect" for Gandhi and that the spoof would not be shown outside the United States. 

<p>The MTV Web site, however, carries a picture of the clone caricature and a write-up on the show, which can be accessed world wide.

<p>"MTV US wants to make it clear that 'Clone High' was created and intended for an American audience," the statement said.

<p>"We recognize and respect that various cultures may view this programming differently, and we regret any offense taken by the content in the show," the statement said.

<p>The animated show parodies several historical figures from around the world, including the United States, where this form of comedy is common, MTV US said.
