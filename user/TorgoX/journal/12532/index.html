<p>Dear Log,<p><em>What impresses people who are not Muslims is Islam as a culture, Islam as a civilization, Islam as a set of beautiful mosques.</em> (from <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/interviews/int2003-03-20.htm">"The Real Islam"</a>)
<p>It is?  Personally, I could care less about the pretty buildings, and all the proto-psychedelic tile-work.</p>

I'm just rude enough to make fun of 'proactive' to someone's face, point out that they don't mean specious when they use it and correct "could care less".</p>

<p>You should have been at HP in 1998 or 1999, prior to the Year of Linux.  The product manager of one of the computer groups in Fort Collins claimed that they were being proactive on Linux.  "Of course we were proactive.  We were the <strong>first</strong> company to actively wait to see what everyone else would do."</p>

<p>The boss' dialogue in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0151804" title="imdb.com">Office Space</a imdb.com> was scarily accurate.  I almost thought it was a documentary.</p>

I think you could almost always care less about something, just maybe not a helluvalot less, and I believe that's what's implied, that it is on the very low end of things you could possibly care about<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
