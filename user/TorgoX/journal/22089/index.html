<p>Dear Log,

<p><blockquote>&laquo;Henry L. Niman, a medical researcher in Pittsburgh who is a strong critic of the W.H.O. for being too conservative, said that with more than 70 percent of the human victims of the disease dying so far, the death toll could in theory exceed a billion people if the disease were to spread rapidly, with little if any reduction in current mortality rates.&raquo;
<p>--<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/30/international/asia/30flu.html">"W.H.O. Official Says Deadly Pandemic Is Likely if the Asian Bird Flu Spreads Among People"</a></blockquote>

But it's okay because the health care infrastructure is prepared, right?

<p><blockquote>&laquo;Since it began, LA County's HALT team [Health Authority Law Enforcement Task Force] has investigated nearly 900 cases of illicit medical services.  For all their successes, they say, the problem of underground medicine is growing, as health care costs and the number of uninsured rise.&raquo;
<p>--<a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health/july-dec04/shadow_11-29.html">"Shadow Medicine"</a></blockquote>

Meanwhile, in the Zeroeth State...

<p><blockquote>&laquo;Iraqis had been left increasingly reliant on self-diagnosis and traditional healing and must buy prescription medicines in the marketplace, Medact said. Under-the-table payments were required to secure many services and there was widespread suspicion of criminal involvement in the distribution of pharmaceutical supplies.&raquo;
<p>--<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1363083,00.html">"Charity
blames invaders for Iraq 'health disaster'"</a></blockquote>

Therefore in conclusion, freedom is on the march!
