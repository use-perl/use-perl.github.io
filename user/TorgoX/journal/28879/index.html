<p><p>Dear Log,
<p>The <a href=
"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/4758636.stm">news</a>
that the Net is about to go from being mostly unencrypted, to mostly 
encrypted, reminded me of this:

<p><blockquote
>&laquo;Alex was used to lawyers. He'd grown up in the company of his
father's numerous hired attorneys. Brasseur was a bent attorney--that
odd and highly exceptional kind of lawyer who wasn't personally
well-to-do. Alex strongly suspected that Brasseur had been on the
wrong side of politics during the State of Emergency.[...]

<p>Most people went through life without ever using a private
currency. Most people were, of course, poor. They didn't have enough
wealth to buy into the private-money system, or enough contacts or
market smarts to use private currencies effectively. Except, of
course, during the State of Emergency, when every American, rich and
poor alike, had been forced to use a private currency because the
Regime had privatized the U.S. dollar.

<p>Alex wasn't exactly sure how "currency privatization" had been
accomplished, back at the time. He was similarly vague about the
Regime's massive "data nationalizations."[...]

<p>Alex was well-to-do, and he had some unlikely friends, so he had the
basics down pretty well. It all had to do with unbreakable encryption,
digital authentication, anonymous remailing, and network
untraceability. These were all computer networking techniques that had
once been considered very odd and naughty. They were also so
elementary to do, that once they were in place, they couldn't be
stopped without tearing the whole Net down.

<p>Of course, once these techniques were in place, they conclusively
destroyed the ability of governments to control the flow of electronic
funds, anywhere, anytime, for any purpose. As it happened, this
process had pretty much destroyed any human control at all over the
modern electronic economy. By the time people figured out that raging
nonlinear anarchy was not exactly to the advantage of anyone
concerned, the process was simply too far gone to stop. All workable
standards of wealth had vaporized, digitized, and vanished into a
nonstop hurricane of electronic thin air. Even physically tearing up
the fiber optics couldn't stop it; governments that tried to just
found that the whole encryption mess oozed swiftly into voice mail and
even fax machines.

<p>One major upshot of the Regime's privatization of the currency was
that large amounts of black-market wealth bad suddenly surfaced. This
had been part of the plan, apparently-that even though the government
was sabotaging its own ability to successfully impose any income tax,
the government would catch up on the other end, by imposing punitive
taxes on previously hidden black-market transactions.

<p>They'd swiftly discovered, however, that the scale of black money
was titanic. The black-market wealth in tax evasion, kickbacks,
official corruption, theft, embezzlement, arms, drugs, prostitution,
barter, and off-the-books moonlighting was far huger than any
conventional economist had ever imagined. The global ocean of black
money was so vast in scope that it was instantly, crushingly obvious
that the standard doctrines of conventional finance had no workable
contact with reality. Economists who'd thought they understood the
basic nature of modern finance had been living in a dogmatic dreamland
as irrelevant as Marxism. After that terrible revelation, there'd been
savage runs on most national currencies and the stock markets had
collapsed.

<p>As the Emergency had deepened, the panicking Regime had rammed its
data nationalizations through Congress, and with that convulsive
effort, the very nature of money and information had both mutated
beyond any repair.

<p>The resultant swirling chaos had become the bedrock of Alex's
everyday notions of modern normality.&raquo;<blockquote
