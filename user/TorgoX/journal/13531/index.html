<div class="span8">
<p>Dear Log,
<p>So I went to the conference last week.  I had great fun!
<p>I was dreading the experience of flying, but
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/ctrl@listserv.aol.com/msg105312.html">a Xanax</a>
for flying made it all very un-harrowing.  In years past, I'd fly out of Albuquerque,
which was always harrowing because of local weater conditions; for this I also used to
take Valium, which sedated me but also made me feel crappy.  But this time the flying
was smooth all the way, and the Xanax, as far as I could tell, had none of the side-effects
of Valium.  In fact, its effects were so generally negligible (except in keeping
me calm), that I couldn't quite see how people could form addictions to it; presumably
at higher doses and/or in other people, it behaves differently.

<p>While at the Conference, I stayed with my very generous friend Sam,
who lives just a mile or so from the hotel, in a wonderfully
cat-infested neighborhood.

<p>My sleep schedule refused to synch up, so I spent most night unable
to get to sleep until at least 3 a.m. local time and unable to get up
before 11a.m. on most days; and one day I just had to SLEEP. I blame
Sam's mind-controlling hypnocats. I blame the occasional heat. I blame
the ambient pollen. But mostly things were just fine.

<p>I got to see so many fun people at the conf. <p>Me and Sam also hung
out, got good Thai food, watched neat DVDs (Brakhage! YOW!), etc; and
since his resolution this year was to learn to cook, I got him a rice
cooker and showed him how to roll vegetable sushi. <br>I also took him
along one night to meet some folks -- he's just sticking his toe into
programming, much less tech conferences, but he was quite impressed by
how pleasant it all was. I think he was worried it'd be like having to
interact with a hundred demented autistic Turkish nematologists or
something.  But we ran into Dominus, Joe Johnston, Dave Adler, and other personable
hyoomons, and so a good time was had by all.

<p>On Saturday, before I left, me and Sam went to Powells (the main
store, not the tech annex), and I went nuts, and bought:

<ul>
<li>Lautreamont -- Complete Works including Maldoror (original French, and two English translations)
<li>Philip K. Dick -- The Man in the High Castle
<li>William S. Burroughs -- My Education
<li>William S. Burroughs -- Naked Lunch
<li>Sarah Vowell - The Partly Cloudy Patriot
<li>Florence King -- with Charity Toward None
<li>Senzaki et al -- The Iron Flute: 100 Zen Koans [Tetteki Tozui]
<li>Shows -- The Legends of Chief Bald Eagle
<li>various -- Open Gate: An Anthology of Haitian Creole Poetry [bilingual, facing pages]
<li>A. A. Milne - Vini-der-Pu [Romanized Yiddish Edition]
<li>Steinbauer -- Neo-Melanesian Dictionary: New Guinea Pidgin-English
<li>various -- a book of hymns in Hopi from like 1930.
<li>Balutansky -- Tambour Battant: A Collection of Haitian Folk Songs, Riddles, Proverbs and Poems
<li>Say It In Yiddish
<li>and a little gift-sized art book of details from the Book of Kells
</ul>

<p>All very cheap -- almost everything under $10.  Living well <em>and cheap</em>
is the best revenge.

<p>And for Sam I got a copy of
<cite>The Man in the High Castle</cite> plus a bunch of Bruce Sterling paperbacks:
<cite>Holy Fire, Heavy Weather, Zeitgeist, Schismatrix Plus,
Distraction</cite>.

<p>I completely forgot that I wanted to go clothes shopping and CD shopping --
these things are not very interesting in Juneau, but still possible.

<p>My general impression of Portland is that it's wonderful in a very
subtle way. There's no obvious source of its wonderfulness: it's not
shockingly clean, nor giddily busy, nor dazzlingly architected, nor can
one just reach out and summon up churros, udon, and Acoma pottery (all
these things being required for my dream city). However, Portland is
<em>nice</em>, consistently. The locals all seemed vastly more competent, sane,
interesting, and generally approachable than anywhere else I've visited
or lived.  Unfortunately, property values are reportedly pretty high;
and like anywhere, commutes and traffic can be a bother.  The demographics are
interesting: it seemed solidly skewed toward white middle-class people in their
20s.  It's unlike Juneau, where the average person seems to be a fit
55-year-old with a Master's in Public Administration, and very unlike Albuquerque, where the average person seems to
be a 40-year-old meth-addicted prostitute named Pepper who never made it
past the 8th grade.

<p>My entire experience of Portland is summed up in one moment:  I asked
a young attractive clerk at Powell's if they had a certain art book by David Byrne.  Not
only did the clerk not make me spell "Byrne", she <em>knew</em> the book, and found its inventory
record in the computer in under 5 seconds, and <em>authentically apologized</em>
for not having the book in stock right then.
<br>I was struck dumb.  Maybe it was aaaaaaaall a dreeaaaaam.

Sounds like you were at the Strand in NYC.

Except for that part....

<h2>Mmm... Portland</h2>

About 6 years ago we drove from Seattle to LA (fantastic scenery, highly recommended; apart from LA obviously) and stopped for a drink in Portland. We stayed for all of half an hour and both left thinking "Portland feels really good, we'll have to go back and see it properly some time".<br> <br>And our first impressions were vindicated big style at OSCON.



<h2>*book*-store people</h2>

Yes, it's wonderful that the largest bookstore west of the Mississippi actually hires <i>book</i> people to work there, not just cash-register people.
<p>
Portland.  Nice city.</p>
