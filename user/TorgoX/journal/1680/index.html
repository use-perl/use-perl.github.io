<h2>Odd</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2001-12-17T14:40:30</h3>
I found that whole piece to be odd.
<br>
<br>She complains no one wants to listen to a female American Muslim.  Didn't George Bush bring female American Muslims to a press conference within a couple of weeks of the attacks?
<br>
<br>She thinks American blacks and Muslims can see through the pilots' eyes, but I cannot.  However, from the beginning I saw very clearly what they wanted and why they did what they did, as clearly or more clearly than the American blacks and Muslims she is referring to.
<br>
<br>Oh, but I am somehow deficient because I cannot "put (myself) in the pilot's seat."  Because I don't wish to kill thousands of Americans, I am unqualified to understand the terrorists.  I didn't realize a desire to be a mass murderer were necessary to achieve understanding.
<br>
<br>Then she goes on about how she can't watch a movie that is historically accurate.  Well, excuse Spielberg for telling the truth.  And at least in WWII we sent in the white boys to be killed first, unlike in Vietnam.
<br>
<br>Finally, her quote about Muhammed Ali, that "No Vietcong ever called me a nigger," makes no sense in the current context.  No Vietcong called you a nigger, but members of al Qaeda attacked your city and killed your neighbors, friends, and family, and called you an infidel who would feel Allah's wrath.  Vietnam is on a completely different frequency than this conflict, and African Americans like Muhammed Ali aren't stupid enough that they can't tell the difference.  Although apparently that author is so lacking in insight.
<br>
<br>Oh, but I am just a stupid evil white guy who "can't" say I am sorry to the people who murdered thousands of my contrymen.
<br>
<br>That piece is muddled at best, and extraordinarily incendiary at worst.  At least she left America, though, because it sucks here, and we wouldn't want her to feel bad.
