<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;Bronfman detests Napster. His speech likened the company to both slavery and Soviet communism. But its servers constitute the nearest extant approximation of his vision of a boundless sea of digital culture. While Ulrich spoke, I logged on to Napster. More than 100,000 people were on the company's machines, frolicking about in terabytes of music. "True fans of the talent are the ones who respect our rights," the drummer was saying. I typed in search terms: Mahler, Mingus, Method Man, Metallica ... all were free for the taking. And all were freely being taken -- users couldn't put a nickel in the machine even if they wanted to. Little wonder that the thought of such systems spreading to films, videos, books, and magazines has riveted the attention of artists, writers, and producers.&raquo;<p

Rampant music piracy may hurt musicians less than they fear. The real threat -- to listeners and, conceivably, democracy itself -- is the music industry's reaction to it"</blockquote><br/><br/></p>

I was watching Metallica's "St Anger" video which is set in San Quentin and I was wondering if that is where they wanted Napster users to be.

Bunch of whiney record industry patsies. Give me the <a href="http://www.cdshakedown.com/02_2001/sanquentin_photo4.jpg" title="cdshakedown.com">Man in Black</a cdshakedown.com> instead.

What, you think that Johnny Cash is all about sharin' the copyrighted material?

<p>

That picture of J. Cash was taken during the taping of "Live at San Quentin", I believe, ca. 1968 or so.  That album's been rereleased, which is undoubtedly giving the great Mr. Cash extra money.

</p><p>

The photo was later reappropriated for an ad campaign announcing the release of <cite>American Recordings</cite> on Rick Rubin's American Recordings label, after Cash had been dumped from Columbia in the 1980s.  The copy that ran with the ad said, "Johnny Cash would like to thank the music industry for their support."  In effect, the ad says that Cash is pissed at having no longer been made salable.

</p><p>

I love Johnny Cash.  He's one of my few heroes.  I just don't think he's one of the "Hey, man, download whatever you want, dude" contingent.</p>
