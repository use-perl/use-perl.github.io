<p>Dear Log,

<p>I don't like the telephone, and the past decade of innovations have
just annoyed me more.  The idea of everyone having a combination

brilliant to me; but now it all seems about as interesting and glamorous
as everyone carrying around a fist-sized can of Lysol, and only slightly
more useful.

<p>Bruce Sterling wrote the following in 1988, about a character who
had something basically like one of these "hands-free" cellphone
attachments we have now:

<p><blockquote
>&laquo;He kept mumbling[...], shaking his head and talking into the
air.  Like a madman.  It was odd how peculiar it looked when you
weren't doing it yourself.&raquo;<blockquote

>island off the coast of America</a>, I have started seeing more
people than usual walking down the street while gesturing madly into
the air and talking to the ground a few feet ahead.
And around here, only the slightest cues of dress distinguish the

fun to keep and eye out to see whether that passerby's urgent
conversation about "and I said I gotta get on with <em>my</em> life!!" is
directed toward a tiny black plastic headset in their other ear, or
toward the less electronically mediated voices in their head.
