<p>Dear Log,
<p>Een my country we have problem.
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;Their government has proved itself incompetent. Yes, it could act
quickly once it had decided to act - but it idled for days. This
disastrous performance will surely saddle the remainder of George
Bush's presidency, just as the botched Desert One rescue of American
hostages from the besieged US embassy in Tehran hobbled that of Jimmy
Carter. Americans expect competence from their leader as a minimum
requirement. And if an image of a crashed helicopter in the Iranian
desert could undo one president, surely pictures of an American city
reduced to a Somali or Bangladeshi kind of chaos spell disaster for
this one.
<br>[...]
<br>It is conceivable that Americans will now call a halt to their
quarter-century experiment in limited government - and the neglected
infrastructure that has entailed. There are some tasks, they may
conclude, which neither individuals nor private companies can do alone
- and evacuating tens of thousands of people from a drowning city is
one of them.
<br>[...]
<br>When corpses float in the streets for five days, the indispensable
nation looks like a society that cannot take care of its own. When Sri
Lanka offers to send emergency aid, the humiliation is
complete.&raquo;<blockquote
>--<a href=
"http://www.guardian.co.uk/katrina/story/0,16441,1562901,00.html"
>"Receding floodwaters expose the dark side of America - but will
anything
change?"</a></blockquote></blockquote>


Meanwhile, in Texistan and environs:
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;[FEMA Director]
Brown himself has minimal experience of managing
emergencies. In the Seventies, he oversaw the emergency services of
Edmund, a town in Oklahoma. For the 10 years before he came to Fema,
he was a lawyer for the business interests of a wealthy family in
Colorado. He was also the head of the International Arabian Horse
Association.

<p>However, he was an old friend of Joseph Allbaugh, who ran
George W Bush's election campaign in 2001 and went on to run Fema,
bringing in Brown as his deputy. When Allbaugh left in 2003 to join a
private company that is winning contracts in Iraq, Brown took over. He
may yet be sorry he did.&raquo;<blockquote

"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1562515,00.html"
>"Flood took disaster agency's experts by
surprise"</a></blockquote></blockquote>


Meanwhile, a happy thought from a few days back:
<blockquote
>&laquo;Ashworth says the fact that the public still
expects inflation to be
contained despite oil prices at $65 a barrel is an indication of the
confidence Greenspan has been able to command. 'We believe in the
Fed's ability to deliver low and stable inflation,' he says.&raquo;<blockquote
>--<a href=
"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,1553111,00.html"
>"Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve for 18 years,
retires
soon."</a></blockquote></blockquote>
