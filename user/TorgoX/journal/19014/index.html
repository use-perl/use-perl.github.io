<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;Christian Reconstruction is blunt stuff, hard and unforgiving as a gravestone. Capital punishment, central to the Reconstructionist ideal, calls for the death penalty in a wide range of crimes, including abandonment of the faith, blasphemy, heresy, witchcraft, astrology, adultery, sodomy, homosexuality, striking a parent, and ''unchastity before marriage'' (but for women only.) 
<p>Biblically correct methods of execution include stoning, the sword, hanging, and burning. Stoning is preferred, according to Gary North, the self-styled Reconstructionist economist, because stones are plentiful and cheap. Biblical Law would also eliminate labor unions, civil rights laws, and public schools. Leading Reconstruction theologian David Chilton declares, "The Christian goal for the world is the universal development of Biblical theocratic republics . . ." Incidentally, said Republic of Jesus would not only be a legal hell, but an ecological one as well-Reconstructionist doctrine calls for the scrapping of environmental protection of all kinds, because there will be no need for this planet earth once The Rapture occurs.

<p>For example, Patrick Henry College in Purcellville, Virginia, a college exclusively for Christian homeschoolers, offers programs in strategic government intelligence, legal training and foreign policy, all with a strict, Bible-based "Christian worldview." [...] In the Bush administration, 7 percent of all internships are handed out to Patrick Henry students, along with many others distributed among similar religious rightist colleges. The Bush administration also recruits from the faculties of these schools, i.e., the appointments of right-wing Christian activist Kay Coles James, former dean of the Pat Robertson School of government, as director of the U.S. Office of Personnel. What better position than the personnel office from which to recruit more fundamentalists?&raquo;

From my journal at <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=109296&amp;cid=9290672" title="slashdot.org">http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=109296&amp;cid=9290672</a slashdot.org> <br> <br>I went to the Republican Convention for the state of Washington this weekend, and one of the proposed resolutions was:<br> <blockquote><div>The United States of America is a Christian nation. As such, all people of all faiths may worship freely, as long as nothing objectionable to the Christian faith is practiced. And, as such, the foundational principles of Christianity [found in the founding fathers' documents] should be taught in all public schools and promoted in all public aspects of life.</div></blockquote> <br>That's right, not just allow religion in public life -- which it already is, it's a matter of degree -- but prohibit anything objectionable to Christianity.  Muahahahaha.

I look forward to a country purged of all things that are objectionable to Christianity, including non-kosher foods, divorce, and witchcraft.

I don't see how the first part ("Biblical theocratic republics") is related to the second part.  Just because both groups call themselves Christians and are on the same side of the political scale?  As noted in the following comments on Slashdot to my other comment, most people don't want to abolish the First Amendment as it pertains to freedom of religion.  They may disagree on what it means, but very few people -- including very few at Patrick Henry -- want America to be a "Christian theocratic republic."<br>
