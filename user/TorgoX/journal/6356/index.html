<p>Dear Log,
<p>I'm putting together the codeblock tar for the LWP book -- which means going thru the book and saying "Oh, there's a program [or more likely part of one]", and then going to that chapter's source file, copying that out, and trying to make a running program out of it.  I'm almost done -- just two more chapters to go.
<p>When I'm done, it'll go on the book's <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perllwp/">web site</a>.  It's looking like there'll be about 35 programs then.

<p>In other news, I just finished a book that I'd picked up for fun, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671705725/"><cite>The Real Frank Zappa Book</cite></a>.  It's worth the read.  Interesting to note that Zappa had the same sort of sleep schedule I tend to slip into -- about a 26-hour cycle, which inconveniently progresses against the "normal" 24-hour Earth day that all primitive Earth plant and <a href="http://www.terrybisson.com/meat.html">meat</a> beings are beholden to.</p>

I'm guessing the sun thing kept me from going<br>fully over to the 25/26-hour day, but my schedule did gradually<br>shift as I stayed up a bit later each day. By the end of the summer<br>I had totally lapped my family and was once again back on a normal<br>schedule.<br> <br>-matt<br> </tt>

<p>I heard 24 1/2 to 25 hours was a pretty common adjustment for humans somehow separated from the sun (say, lost in a cave).  That's why I want to move to <a href="http://mars.complete-isp.com/zubrin/Zubrin.html" title="complete-isp.com">Mars</a complete-isp.com> .<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<h2>ah, you should have asked me :)</h2>

<p>I have all the code I checked still hanging around on a box somewhere...all that cutting and pasting gets tedious<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Ohyeah, I didn't think of that.  But anyway, your code is from the QC1 stage, and I made a few changes between there and the final version -- and I don't remember exactly what changes.  So if I used your code, I'd have been always <em>haunted</em> by the idea that it failed to reflect those changes.  Anyway, it was good for me to make one last sweep thru the book before calling it definitively done.
<p>I wonder if anyone actually looks at these tars that accompany ORA books.</p>

<h2>I get the tar's</h2>

I have to admit that I download the tar's. It's just plain easier when you want to steal^wstudy the code.<br> <br>I have lifted at least 3 or 4 sections from a variety of programs offered as tarballs from a variety of tomes.<br> <br>A tar file of the code is the second best thing, errata is the first, that O'Reilly's website for a book offers. Then again most good authors that have websites for their books seem to have an errata section as well as a section for code from the book.

<h2>Meat</h2>

But remember also that Vonnegut referred to humans as "meat", notably in Cat's Cradle.<br>
