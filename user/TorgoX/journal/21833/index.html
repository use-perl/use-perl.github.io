<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;Steering it all was Rove, but he had able and ruthless deputies. One
of them was Steven Schmidt, head of the Republican 'war room' geared to attacking Kerry.
Schmidt, dubbed 'the general' by his staff, was fond of walking the corridors of his
headquarters urging people to 'kill, kill, kill'.&raquo;
<p>--<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1345471,00.html">"How
Bush tapped into a well of faith"</a></blockquote>
Meanwhile...
<p><blockquote>&laquo;The Sunday School adopted Babbitt's system of
military ranks. Quickened by this spiritual refreshment, it had a boom. It did not
become the largest school in Zenith--the Central Methodist Church kept ahead of it
by methods which Dr. Drew scored as "unfair, undignified, un-American,
ungentlemanly, and unchristian"--but it climbed from fourth place to second, and there
was rejoicing in heaven, or at least in that portion of heaven included in the
parsonage of Dr. Drew, while Babbitt had much praise and good repute.
<p>He had received the rank of colonel on the general staff of the school. He was
plumply pleased by salutes on the street from unknown small boys; his ears
were tickled to ruddy ecstasy by hearing himself called "Colonel"; and if he
did not attend Sunday School merely to be thus exalted, certainly he thought
about it all the way there.&raquo;
