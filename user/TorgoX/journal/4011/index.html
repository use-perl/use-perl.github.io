<p>Dear Log,
<p>As much as allnighters programming (or writing) are considered common in the biz, I'm getting a bit old for such things now.
<p>I need a walker and a comfy chair, and an AARP membership!!</p>

I think I'm older than both of you put together so if I can drive to st. louis and back in a weekend without much sleep, you guys shouldn't whine about an all-nighter<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I'll have to send y'all a box of depends and efferdent soon.</p>

Don't forget to also send us some Gold Bond Medicated Powder, and some slacks where the waist comes up to my neck.  And one of those little 0-shaped plastic changepurses that ya pinch to open up, so I can keep my coins someplace.
<p>Also: <cite>Matlock</cite>, on betamax tapes.</p>

<p>Feh! In my day, we didn't have "all nighters." We couldn't leave work ever! After learning to crawl around as little babies, we'd be stuck to doing tech support until we were aged 6 years. And then we'd do QA for another ten years. There was no "teevee" or "birthday parties" or "french kissing." We didn't have time! We had to work three shifts a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. AND WE LIKED IT THAT WAY!</p>

I did my share of those in college for the newspaper, back when I was a journalist.  Then I became a programmer, after I married, and I decided that such things are bad for married life.  No more, I vowed.  I do the occasional late-nighter, but I plan them in advance.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
