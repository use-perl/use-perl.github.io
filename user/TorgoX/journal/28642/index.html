<p><p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;The truth is that when faced with the first really hard moral choice
of their young lives, the Google boys copped out. And what makes their
failure dismaying is that for a few halcyon years after the foundation
of their company in 1999, there was a feeling abroad that maybe this
really would be a different kind of venture - one more in tune with
the original libertarian ethos of the net. Now it looks as though the
cynics were right all along: in the end, money talks, and it says that
principles are expensive. 

<br><br>Google's capitulation to the Chinese regime prompts some sobering
thoughts. One is that while one may occasionally be justified in
trusting an individual, one can never, ever place the same kind of
trust in a company. That's why all the current concern about
'corporate social responsibility' is ultimately just eyewash. In the
end, if there is a conflict between doing what is ethically right and
what is commercially important, shareholder-driven enterprises will
always choose the latter. They may do so gleefully (Microsoft,
Halliburton), or in a mournful this-hurts-us-as-much-as-it-offends-you
spirit (Google), but they will do it.&raquo;<blockquote
>--<a href=
"http://www.guardian.co.uk/china/story/0,,1697233,00.html"
>"Google's founding principles fall at great firewall of
China"</a></blockquote></blockquote>
Google needs to just plain stop collaborating with the goonsquads, Chinese or otherwise.</p>
