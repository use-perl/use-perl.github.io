<p>Dear Log,
<p>I do not understand the <a href="http://www.foodtv.com/foodtv/show/0,6525,FL,00.html">Two Fat Ladies</a>.  I do not understand what they say, and I do not understand what they cook.
<p>But I am pleased that surrealism is alive, and in the kitchen, and on television.  Tivok understands this, and gets the show for me.</p>

And check out his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1584790830" title="amazon.com">cookbook</a amazon.com> as well.  I don't cook (I have a nagging fear my kids will one day call me Iron Chef Boyardee for the amount of dinosaur pasta I foist upon them when their mom works late), but I picked it up at Costco and found it just as full of interesting science tidbits as the TV show.

<h2>They're great!</h2>

Seriously, you'd rather have <a href="http://www.jamieoliver.net/" title="jamieoliver.net">the naked chef</a jamieoliver.net>?

<p>The 2 fat ladies (only 1 fat lady, now alas) used to cook real food designed to keep peasants fat over winter.  Tastes fucking great and has lots of fatty goodness.  And real meat.  Not some pathetic sliver of ham, goddam joints of the stuff.  They were a good antidote to modern cooking.

Oh God no, I can't stand the Naked Chef -- who, by the way, WEARS CLOTHES.  Strike one!

<p>I literally get woozy watching his show, because of the jerky fake-o v&eacute;rit&eacute; camerawork.  Strike two!

</p><p>Also, there's just something <em>wrong</em> with his accent.  I can't put my finger on it, but I practically expect some relevation that he really has a totally RP accent, but years ago got a voice coach to teach him how to sound all authentic and folksy.
<br>Strike three, he's out!
</p><p>Enough with him and his kweezeen, bring on the Two Fat Ladies and their <a href="http://www.foodtv.com/foodtv/episode/0,6283,FL1B01,00.html" title="foodtv.com">openly crazy and butter-soaked ideas</a foodtv.com>.</p>

...he cooks pretty good stuff (at least the vegetarian items/versions have been good). And IMO he explains what he's doing very well, unlike Emeril.

My big problem with Jamie Oliver (The Naked Chef): his tongue is too big for his mouth.  Seriously.<p>
On the other hand, he's fast enough in the kitchen that he's at least entertaining to watch.</p>

<h2>Sadly</h2>

I'm a fan of both Emeril (I believe he might be a Masshole) and Iron Chef. I'm not looking for cooking -- I'm looking for entertainment.



<h2>Cooks Tour</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/anithri/">anithri</a> on 2002-10-10T17:57:43</h3>
I'm only slightly surprised that there are a lot of Food Network fans in the ranks of Perl users...  I wonder why that is.  I have to mention my current favorite of the shows... A Cooks Tour.  Tony Bourdain is a witty and funny.

If you haven't read Bourdain's books, you're missing a BUNCH of belly laughs.

<h2>The Cooks' Bookshop</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pdcawley/">pdcawley</a> on 2002-10-12T21:26:46</h3>
We just spent far too much money at the remaining Fat Lady's bookshop in Edinburgh. Seriously worth the trip if you like a decent selection of cookery books...
