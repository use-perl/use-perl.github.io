<div class="span8">
<p>Dear Log,
<p>I've been looking at PDF as a format lately.  Whereas I could sort of wrap my mind around PostScript, and had no trouble with RTF, PDF is not so friendly.
<p>PDF is an odd format, internally.  It's a strange blend of simplicity, human-readability, optimization, and inscrutibility.  For example, it's very like some kind of simple data-dumping format where you just have:

<p>defineobject "Blorch" => {
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; key1 => val1,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; key2 => val2,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; key3 => val3,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>}</p>
...over and over, with the understanding that there's some special semantics imputed to magically-named objects and keys to get the ball rolling.

<p>Except that PDF is only <em>sort of</em> like that -- the object IDs aren't alphanumeric symbol names, they're integers, and there's all sorts of byte-counts and byte-offsets being tossed around.  It's as if an XML file ended with a lookup table of all the root's children's byte-offsets.
PDF is complicated enough that a simple "Hello World" document is several hundred bytes, because of all the per-document overhead.

<p>Here, <a href="http://www.vector.org.uk/v184/pdf184.htm">this explains it pretty well</a>.

<p>PDF is not a crazy format by any means, although there were some odd decisions made.  For example, in the original spec, all the document-indexing data is at the very end of the file, whereas clearly if you were thinking about streaming a file to web clients, you'd probably put it at the beginning instead.  (What they were thinking of was not that, but the problem of "fast saves" -- changing a disk file by just adding new objects to it and appending a new cross-references table.)  Of course, in time, they <em>did</em> think of streaming, so for that and other reasons, the PDF spec has become a massive massive document.

<p>Suddenly the MIDI File Format sounds friendly in comparison.
<p>Long story short: Thank God there's CPAN modules for dealing with PDFs!</p>

<h2>And C-libs!</h2>

Yes, PDF is a bear.  I believe most of the Perl modules rely on a C library (whose name escapes me).  Oddly enough, PHP comes bundled with support for PDF writing and it uses that same C-lib.  I believe you can embedded fonts in PDF, which partially addresses my long-standing beef with typesetting in Unix (it hasn't changed in th 20 years).

groff?  GROFF?!  That's for GNU weenies.  Real Men use troff.<br>

Nah, it's just another implementation.  Now as soon as I finish my implementation of troff in perl...

<p>No, I would have to be seriously wacked out to even <i>consider</i> that.
