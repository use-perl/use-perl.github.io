<div class="span8">
<p>Dear Log,
<p>Apparently the secret to successfully
giving away kittens
is to take pictures and put up <a href="http://interglacial.com/temp/kittens_poster.jpg">flyers with them</a>.  Otherwise it's a tough sell, even if they're free.
<p>So, I made up a <a href="http://interglacial.com/temp/kittens_poster.jpg">JPEG</a> (plus a bit at the bottom with the little teary-offy bits with my phone number); and I emailed the JPEG to the copy shop down the block where they made me about fifteen color printouts  at about thirty cents apiece.  I didn't even get eight of the flyers up (at the supermarkets, at the library, etc) before some nice people called and snatched up not just the three on the poster, but also <a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-09-05_tigerkitty/sunlight_and_teacup">the one</a> that missed out on being on the poster for logistical reasons.
<p>So now it's just the <a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-08-19_cat_hive/alltogether_minus_allblack">mothercat</a>
and <a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-08-23_kittens/booksheft_cat_1">the black one</a>, who I'm keeping.
<p>The mothercat occasionally looks around as if she's forgotten her keys somewhere, but then sees the black one, and says "Oh, there they are.  Keys or whatever.".</p>

<h2>Time to get the mother spayed</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/btilly/">btilly</a> on 2004-10-02T00:57:50</h3>
Before she litters again.<br/><br/>Cats are cute.  But they reproduce quickly, and there are only so many people with room in their homes for another cat.

<h2>Which raises the question</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/genericus/">genericus</a> on 2004-10-02T06:48:47</h3>
did you ever find out who owns mom?  Or did she seem to be stray?

<h2>Re:Which raises the question</h2>

I think I decided that if she belonged to someone, she wouldn't have up and moved the kittens out of wherever that was.  Ergo, stray, or close enough.

Very true.  I just asked the vet about that the other day.

Don't wait.  My sister-in-law didn't succeed in getting her acquired stray neutered until after the third litter.  (She swears that the cat was pregnant again before delivering the second litter.)

<h2>cats...</h2>

The dominant life form of Earth (or Earp).

<p>The black kitten looks very close to my childhood friend, Misty. He was gunmetal grey more than black, though. He's the cutest of the bunch<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>



<h2>What I want to know is</h2>

Did they keep your names for the kittens?

No clue.  I always sort of considered them temporary names.
