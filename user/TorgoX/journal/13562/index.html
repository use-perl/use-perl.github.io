<p>Dear Log,
<blockquote>&laquo;Microsoft Word documents are notorious for containing private
information in file headers which people would sometimes rather not
share.  The British government of Tony Blair just learned this lesson
the hard way.

<p>Last week, Alastair Campbell, Blair's Director of Communications and
Strategy, was in the hot seat in British Parliament hearings
explaining what roles four of his employees played in the creation of
a plagiarized dossier on Iraq which the UK government published in
February 2003.  The names of these four employees were found hidden
inside of a Microsoft Word file of the Iraq dossier which was posted
on the 10 Downing Street Web site for use by the press.  The "dodgy
dossier" as it became known in the British press raised serious
questions about the quality of British intelligence before the second
Iraq war.&raquo;</blockquote>

<p>I had a dream last night in which I helped a wounded Bill Gates back to health.  He left before dinner and without saying thank you.
