<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;Eight chief executives of US corporations were invited to appear before a senate hearing last week to discuss the scabrous issue of excessive executive pay. None of them showed up, perhaps wisely. How do you defend a $40m (ÃâÃÂ£25m) or $50m pay packet unless with the same kind of lame excuse voiced by football managers, that it is the market rate? 
<p>Over the year, executives took a 15% pay hike, compared with the average worker's rise of just 3.2%. As for the eight who failed to show, let them be named and shamed here:<p>Larry Ellison of Oracle,<br>Michael Eisner of Walt Disney,<br>Leo Mullin of Delta Air Lines,<br>Edward Breen of Tyco,<br>David Cote of Honeywell International,<br>Scott McNealy of Sun Microsystems,<br>Jeff Barbakow of Tenet healthcare<br>and the former General Electric chief executive Jack Welch.&raquo;<p

... I wouldn't need to go to the senate, I'd have people to do that for me.

40 million?  I don't think the senators are that cheap-- anymore, that is, they have been buttered so well in the past that the prices have gone up.<br>

<p>People exist who make more money than I?  What tomorrow, people who own more than one automobile?  SOMEONE should CORRECT the WORLD!!</p>

You'd think we would have some way to correct that problem, perhaps by having these companies be "public" and "shareholders" voicing their opinions.

<p>If I have to get up off of my from my computer to voice my opinion, no deal.  If they're not smart enough to withstand my scorching economic analysis and withering wit in cyberspace, they're dinosaurs and will die off in the next ice age anyway.</p>

I say we make dinosaurs illegal, retroactively!
