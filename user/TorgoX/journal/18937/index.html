<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;Monticello, October 31, 1819
<p>...As you say of yourself, I TOO AM AN EPICUREAN. I consider the genuine (not the imputed) doctrines of Epicurus as containing everything rational in moral philosophy which Greece and Rome have left us. Epictetus, indeed, has given us what was good of the Stoics; all beyond, of their dogmas, being hypocrisy and grimace. Their great crime was in their calumnies of Epicurus and misrepresentations of his doctrines; in which we lament to see the candid character of Cicero engaging as an accomplice. Diffuse, vapid, rhetorical, but enchanting. His prototype Plato, eloquent as himself, dealing out mysticisms incomprehensible to the human mind, has been deified by certain sects usurping the name of Christians; because, in his foggy conceptions, they found a basis of impenetrable darkness whereon to rear fabrications as delirious of their own invention.
<p>These they fathered blasphemously on Him whom they claimed as their Founder, but who
would disclaim them with the indignation which their caricatures of His religion so justly excite.
Of Socrates we have nothing genuine but in the Memorabilia of Xenophon; for Plato makes him one
of his Collocutors merely to cover his own whimsies under the mantle of his name; a liberty of which
we are told Socrates himself complained...

<p>That Jefferson was some kinda Commaniss or something.  I hear he even <em>spoke French</em>.
  It sounds like he doesn't even believe in personal telepathy with Our Lord And Savior Jesus Christ!  Shame on him!</p>
