<p>Dear Log,
<p>I was chatting with <a href="http://www.freedonia.com/user/carl/index.970321.html">Carl
Steadman</a> the other night (he's apparently a fan of
the <a href="http://interglacial.com/user/sburke/ma/">elevated depths</a> of my thesis,
to my <em>extreme</em> surprise).  And he was telling me how he used to study
<a href="http://www.lacan.com/">Lacan</a>.
Carl said that Lacan made his writings deliberately opaque, deliberately hard to understand.
("but that's an important aspect of what they impart to the student. also keeps out the fanboys.")
And I thought, <em>humph, Voltaire with not approve!</em>  Clart&eacute; <a href="http://haitianproverbs.com/">et tout &ccedil;a.</a>

<p>But this past week I've been rereading Orwell's <cite>1984</cite>, and thinking how,
yes, much of it really is insightful and perceptive book, just like people say.  And then I stumbled on
<a href="http://www.online-literature.com/orwell/1984/">these comments</a>
that random doofuses have made about the profundity of <cite>1984</cite> in their minds.

<p>And I thought, ya know, maybe <cite>1984</cite> would have benefitted from just
a few drops of that opaqueness that Lacan liked to smear around.  To keep out the fanboys.</p>

Yup.  But <a href="http://www.alterpresse.org/article.php3?id_article=919" title="alterpresse.org">it gets more complicated.</a alterpresse.org>

You've been hanging too much on #perlfr.

<h2>Orwell</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brev/">brev</a> on 2004-10-05T10:02:51</h3>
I just finished a book of Orwell's columns from 1942-1945.<br> <br>One column is about how Italian war propaganda did not bother to even be self-consistent, as the British equivalent was. He decides the British effort was a waste, and in a throwaway line wonders if even the enemy could be switched without anyone noticing.<br> <br>One by one, you can watch many of the ideas of 1984 crystallizing. It's fascinating.<br> <br>But there's a lot more to this book. I kept seeing parallels and contrasts with our own era, where the arch-capitalists of the USA and Britain are at war with unmistakably bad people, and the left is divided about this.

Careful!  If you compare the pro-war people today to being on the Good Side in WWII, you risk becoming one of us.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Piffle. Real depth is never penetrated by the fanboy gaze, so why muddy the surface?
</p>
<p>In any case, George himself had <a href="http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/essays/col-patel1.htm" title="netcharles.com">rather different ideas</a netcharles.com> about clarity of expression, so it would've been a tough sell.
