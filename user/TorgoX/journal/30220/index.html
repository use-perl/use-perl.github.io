<p><p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;Behind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling
away about pig-iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year
Plan. The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any
sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would
be picked up by it, moreover, so long as he remained within the field
of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well
as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being
watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought
Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even
conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate
they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live
-- did live, from habit that became instinct -- in the assumption that
every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every
movement scrutinized.

<br><br>Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was safer, though,
as he well knew, even a back can be revealing.&raquo;<blockquote
