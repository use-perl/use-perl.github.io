<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;Quelle blague! I went into the booth, where supposedly I was going to read the ballot and
choose my candidate for the supreme soviet - "choose" means you have a choice. There was just
one name, already marked. I burst out laughing uncontrollably, right there in the booth, just like
a child. It took me a long time to compose myself. I leave the booth, and here comes <i>[her husband]</i> Yury,
stony-faced. I lifted my collar and ducked down into it so that only my eyes were visible; it was
just hilarious.&raquo;<p

In California, with incumbent "Democrats" running for the important positions, a<br>voter has very little practical power as an individual.  I mean, Gray Davis won<br>80% of the primary vote.  And he is awful!  Of course, I voted for someone else<br>in the primary, but that had no effect.  And however I vote in the main<br>election, Davis will win anyway.<br> <br>We need some sort of <a href="http://www.fairvote.org/irv/" title="fairvote.org">instant runoff</a fairvote.org> <br>election system, with<br> <a href="http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/once/pd_chap9.html" title="blackened.net">instant recall</a blackened.net> <br>to keep power decentralized.  These would be greatly aided by computerized<br>voting -- but the only way I can see to make it hard to cheat would be to have<br>public ballots, instead of secret ones.  I haven't actually heard anyone yet give<br>a good reason *why* secret ballots are important.<br> <br>
