<p><p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;<cite>Memoirs of a Geisha</cite> is a case in point.[...]  Officials
feared that the film - in which the Chinese actress, Zhang Ziyi, plays
the part of a Japanese geisha whose virginity is put up for sale in
the 1930s - would become a focus of public anger towards Japan. [...]
"She is the most shameless Chinese woman in the world. I wonder
whether she ever thought about the pain brought by the Sino-Japanese
war," wrote one of the least offensive web critics. [...]

<br><br>At a popular DVD shop in north-west Beijing, staff say they sell 60
copies of <cite>Memoirs [of a Geisha]</cite> every day, making it one
of their top two moneymakers (along with <cite>Brokeback
Mountain,</cite> which has also yet to win approval for release in
China).
<br><br>"I guess about 70% of the stuff we have is pirated," said a
sales assistant. "The police come from time to time and we close until
they've gone. But they come back in private and ask us to give them
free DVDs. Then we open again." 

<br><br>"Censorship isn't all bad because it stimulates demand and
promotes the development of the piracy business," said one radical
blogger, Muzimei, whose name was once among the list of banned words
on the internet, despite being used commercially to sell everything
from underwear to cockroach killers.[...]

<br><br>"It is becoming more difficult to block and monitor web traffic so
we need to switch to guidance," said an official responsible for
internet surveillance. "Strict management didn't work. It is like
trying to control a flood. Guiding is more effective than
blocking.[...] If you want to control [China], mere politics is not
enough. You must control minds. You need to win the battle for
ideas."&raquo;<blockquote
>--<a href=
"http://www.guardian.co.uk/china/story/0,,1709275,00.html"
>"Pirates and bloggers beat China's great wall of
propaganda"</a></blockquote></blockquote>

I bet that in five years, China will have the same uncensored and completely moronic mass-media as anywhere else in Eurasia.  Censorship is a hassle.  Lying, however, is a job skill!

<br><br>I look forward to the day when I can point my satellite-kerjigger and receive 24-hour fair and balanced coverage of how Our Eternal Enemies The Taiwanese And Japanese are indeed ceaselessly conspiring against Us Chinese Patriots Of The Homeland Of Unanimous Popular Pride And Ten Thousand Grand Beneficences.  And maybe one of the insightful Beijing news mags can cook up a <cite>Newsweek</cite>-style cover story with a Tibetan kid on the front, with the caption "Why do they hate us?".</p>
