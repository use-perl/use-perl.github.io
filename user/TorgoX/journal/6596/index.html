<p>Dear Log,
<p>Worst prose I've seen lately:
<blockquote>"In Cherokee tourism in the mid-1990s, semiotic potency, use-value, and exchange-value intersected in compelling ways.  Syllabic objects were differentiated in terms of their semiotic use potential.  The distinction had to do with whether syllabic objects were considered to possess symbolic use-value, which, in the case of texts, meant that they were considered to have significant and specific meanings or performative powers."
</blockquote>
Almost as bad as <a href="http://www.theonion.com/onion3826/grad_student.html">this</a>.</p>
