Where do you find this stuff Torgo?! Fundy Native Americans now TOO? I just don't want to know how they reconcile native beliefs with the whole crap of christianity.  Where are the locusts when you need them anyway?

I'm not really surprised. Christian fundamentalism (and more generally
Protestantism as a whole phenomenon) is a reaction against all the progress in
science, arts, philosophy and theology that happened in Europe during the last
seven centuries. Thus, natives from any non-European country, having not
participated in the European evolution that led out of the Middle Age, are
perhaps more likely to grasp fundamentalism (esp. under the influence of
zealous missionaries) than the people who recognize themselves in the history
of modern civilization, and to its achievements: notably, in this case,
secularization of government and of political thought. Moreover the poor level of education, and the high level of alcoholism and poverty, makes Natives probably more susceptible to fall into a strong and highly superstitious religion, for the impression of psychological security it gives.

Wow, that's one of the biggest piles of nonsense I've read in quite awhile, congrats.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>Actually, fundamentalism was started as largely intellectual movement, not a reaction against progress at all: it was a reaction against the dilution of the Christian faith, against the "liberal" theologians who professed things like salvation apart from Christ.  It had precious little to do with science, arts, or philosophy, and the theology it was rejecting had nothing to do with progress, but regress.<br> <br>And Protestantism<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... surely you know that it came about largely because the Catholic church was rejecting progress?<br> <br>And your psychoanalysis of the "natives" is both offensive and illogical.  You unreasonably impugn them as being dolts and dullards, and unreasonably impugn Christianity as being unable to withstand intellectual scrutiny.<br> <br>I don't hold any of it against you, but really, this post was just way off base.<br>
