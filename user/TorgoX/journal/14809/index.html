<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;Nor was Whalen forgotten during his old age. He was notably vociferous when lorry drivers, mostly owner-operators, protesting against fuel tax in 2000, called for a new "Jarrow crusade" in the guise of a convoy of slow-moving lorries from Tyneside to London. Whalen described the plea as a "ridiculous insult". "What the farmers and hauliers are after has got nothing to do with what we were about," he said, adding "for us it was a question of hardship and hunger, but these people are well off - and the farmers are hardly an example to follow: they've sacrificed the country for their own gain."&raquo;<p

">"The march is over":</a> Cornelius Whalen, the last of the Jarrow marchers, died this weekend. So what has become of the shipbuilding town that he and 199 other men made a byword for industrial decline and poverty?
