<p>Dear Log,

<p>From <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/014015373X">Voltaire's
Bastards</a></cite> :

<p><blockquote>&laquo;The more understandable and common reaction of the citizen-expert is
defensive. He attempts to turn his prison cell into a fortress by
raising and thickening the walls. This padded box may be a cell, but it
is also a link within some larger process and is therefore essential. He
alone understands and controls the workings of his own box. His power as
an individual consists of the ability to withhold his knowledge of
cooperation.

<p>In other words, "information" is the currency of a society built upon
systems. Once a man has given out his information, he has spent his
capital. He therefore doles it out with care. He trades his information
for that of others. When threatened, he refuses cooperation -- for
example, by exaggerating difficulties or inventing them or moving slowly
or offering misleading information. The only real power of expertise
lies in retention. The more self-confident the individual, the less
likely he has been to choose and isolated and well-defended box. Even
so, as Marshall McLuhan put it, "The expert, as such, is full of
insecurity. That is why he specializes in order to obtain some degree of
confidence."&raquo;</blockquote>
