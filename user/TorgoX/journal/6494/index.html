<p>Dear Log,
<p>Today I did what I do when I have to review some really arduous and involved code:
I print it out and go to some near-empty diner and sit there for a long time, reading the code
and nibbling at whatever, and sipping iced tea.  My record so far is about nine hours
I spent in a diner in Grants, New Mexico, going over the old code for HTML::TreeBuilder
and endless pages of trace output, trying to figure out why it just wasn't working.
<p>But today it was just an hour or so pondering the code for the new
(perlpodspec-compliant) Pod parser,
which I hadn't looked at in ages.  I did a bit of refactoring, and a bit of rearranging,
and clarified the code here and there.  I hope I can do an alpha release in two or three
weeks, maybe even with a passable amount of documentation.</p>

<p>I will have to mail you your Official Pod Squad Kommisar Fez since you aren't coming to TPC<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) You'll have to wear it at the diner and get the Shriner discount while attracting midgets in carts.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Wowza!  Then I'll be an Ottoman emperor!!  VIZIER, off with his KHEKH!

<p>Random memory:  Once, a younger me was walking down a street in downtown Buffalo, wearing a stately black <a href="http://theimaginaryworld.com/pic767.jpg" title="theimaginaryworld.com">Jughead hat</a theimaginaryworld.com> (minus text and picture).  A middle-aged black guy in a leather jacket was talking into a payphone, saw me walking by, and said "Hold on a second" into the phone, and said to me:<br>--"Hey!"<br>--"Huh?"<br>--"What religion is your hat?"
</p><p>I don't remember what I said to that complex question, but I have since decided that that will be the title of my life-affirming Oprah-tastic motivational book.</p>
