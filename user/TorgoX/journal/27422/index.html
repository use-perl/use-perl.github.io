<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;Alarm about the perilous state of the environment has gathered pace in
recent years. China is the world's second-largest producer of
greenhouse gases, and the World Bank has warned it is home to 16 of
the planet's 20 most air-polluted cities.&raquo;<blockquote
>--<a href=
"http://www.guardian.co.uk/china/story/0,7369,1605146,00.html"
>"Satellite data reveals Beijing as air pollution capital of
world"</a></blockquote></blockquote>
Meanwhile...
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;[O'Brien said:] "Suppose that we choose to wear ourselves out
faster. Suppose that we quicken the tempo of human life till men are
senile at thirty. Still what difference would it make? Can you not
understand that the death of the individual is not death? The party is
immortal."

<br><br>As usual, the voice had battered Winston into helplessness. Moreover
he was in dread that if he persisted in his disagreement O'Brien would
twist the dial again. And yet he could not keep silent. Feebly,
without arguments, with nothing to support him except his inarticulate
horror of what O'Brien had said, he returned to the attack.

<br><br>"I don't know -- I don't care. Somehow you will fail. Something
will defeat you. Life will defeat you."&raquo;<blockquote
