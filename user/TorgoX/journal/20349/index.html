<p>Dear Log,
<p>My parents, who were visiting me since right after (<em>right after</em>) I got back from OSCon,
have gone back to LA.  Hurrah!
<p>Yes yes, we'd <em>all</em> like to think of me as the product of some horrible
Warsaw Pact eugenics lab, or maybe that I was raised by a swarm of something;
but in fact I do have normal hyoomon parents,
having the morphology and finances typical of loud white Baby Boomers,
and exhibiting many of the usual genes that distinguish us from the lemurs.
<p>They are getting slightly old.  In a slighty goofy way.  In that
"JERRY, DID YOU REMEMBER TO TAKE YOUR PILLS?
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE!!!" way.  In a I'm-not-going-deaf-you're-just-always-mumbling way.
<p>The other day, while I was off to putter in the kitchen for a bit, I sat them down in front of my laptop
and fullscreened a DVD of <cite>The Office</cite>, and set it to play two episodes at them.
<p>They watched.
<p>They didn't get it.  At all.
<p>I might as well have put on
an endless loop of <a href="http://www.fortunecity.com/tattooine/sputnik/53/other/vrml.htm">VRML
test-files.</a>
<p>These are people that I concretely remember owning Devo
records, when I was a child.  Now my dad just watches one of those cable channels that's all just stock footage of planes.  And my mom watches FoodTV.  A lot.
<p>I should count my blessings that my dad doesn't read Tom Clancy novels
aloud while my mom flips thru <cite>Redbook</cite> or something.
But still.</p>
