<p>Dear Log,

<p>
I've been busy busy busy on my article for the next issue of
<i><a href="http://www.tpj.com/">The Perl Journal</a></i>.  It's
about 
<a
href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Text-Unidecode">Text::Unidecode</a>, which turns all writing systems into
US-ASCII.  The example writing system that I focus on in the article
is <a href="http://www.haveeru.com.mv/">Divehi</a>, the script
used by people in the <a
href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/indian_subcontinent/maldives/">Maldives</a>, an 
<a href="http://www.undp.org/missions/maldives/maldives.htm">atoll</a> (a <a
href="http://machaut.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/WEBSTER.sh?WORD=atoll">word</a>
that originally started out as a label for just those specific
islands, in fact) in the Indian Ocean, south-southwest of India,
right on the Equator.

<p>Divehi is related to Sinhalese, but its writing system is very
different.  Good thing, too -- if it were written the same as Sinhalese,
I'd have to find some other almost-as-good writing
system as an example for my article.

<p>Not that
<a href="http://www-texdev.mpce.mq.edu.au/l2h/indic/Sinhala/lreport/node2.html">Sinhalese script</a> is exactly hard to look at, tho.  In fact,
Sinhalese is one of my favorite writing systems, along with
<a href="http://asianart.com/exhibitions/calligraphy/">Tibetan</a>
and <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/burmese.htm">Burmese</a>
And some styles of <a href="http://www.learnkhmer.com/">Khmer</a>
can be real pretty, too; and I do wish that the
Mongolians would use <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/mongolian.htm">Old
Script</a> more often.  Hard to read, but very pretty.	
<br>Odd that these writing systems are all native to countries with
with troubled politics.  Altho calling what happened in Cambodia a matter
of "politics" is a bit of an understatement.

<p>A thought about the Maldives:  I wonder what it's like being from a
country that almost no-one has ever heard of.  "I'm from the Maldives."
"Malta?" "No, the Maldives."  "That's that country by Romania, isn't it?"
"No, it's off the coast of India."  "Oh, I bet it's one of those tiny
little desert islands with just a dozen
<a href="http://members.aol.com/essobmcc/brakbook/songbook/mookaluk.htm">Polynesian</a>
people on it!"  "Well,
there's a third of a million of us, and we're not Polynesian."

<br>I don't know about buying land there, though.  Coral-reef atolls
and rising sea levels <a href="http://www.gstt.org/publications/news/news1/DOC4.html">don't really mix well</a>.</p>
