<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;[Winston Smith]
had been appointed to a sub-committee of a sub-committee which had
sprouted from one of the innumerable committees dealing with minor
difficulties that arose in the compilation of the Eleventh Edition of
the Newspeak Dictionary. They were engaged in producing something called
an Interim Report, but what it was that they were reporting on he had
never definitely found out. It was something to do with the question of
whether commas should be placed inside brackets, or outside. There were
four others on the committee, all of them persons similar to himself.

<p>There were days when they assembled and then promptly dispersed again,
frankly admitting to one another that there was not really anything to
be done. But there were other days when they settled down to their work
almost eagerly, making a tremendous show of entering up their minutes
and drafting long memoranda which were never finished -- when the
argument as to what they were supposedly arguing about grew
extraordinarily involved and abstruse, with subtle haggling over
definitions, enormous digressions, quarrels, threats, even, to appeal to
higher authority. And then suddenly the life would go out of them and
they would sit round the table looking at one another with extinct eyes,
like ghosts fading at cock-crow.&raquo;
<p>-- from the last chapter of
<cite><a href="http://www.online-literature.com/orwell/1984/">1984</a><cite></blockquote></p>
