<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;When it comes to helping others, American aid is mean and hugely
politicised. G8 talks about Africa or debt relief cannot disguise the
fact that, with international aid a mere 0.16% of its economic might
last year, the US has long been the least generous nation, while its
trade regime impoverishes millions worldwide.
<p>If we do give for Katrina, let's react as America would to any
developing country which fails to prepare for disaster and allows its
people to die, such as Zimbabwe or North Korea: set conditions for aid
use, channel it away from the government to trusted charities, and
insist on intensive scrutiny of the results.&raquo;<blockquote

>"America needs change not charity"</a>:
Withholding aid from the United States is the only way to remove its
domestic and foreign policy blinkers
</blockquote></blockquote>
Also,
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;Gerard and Sandra Scott were stranded in their New Orleans hotel with
their young son but police did nothing as they shouted for help from
the hotel windows. "I couldn't describe how bad the authorities were,"
Mr Scott told Radio 4's World at One. "Just the little things like
taking photographs of us ... for their own personal photo albums,
little snapshot photographs.
<p>"At one point, there were a load of girls on the roof of the lobby
saying 'Can you help us?' and the policemen said 'Show us what you
have got' and made signs for them to lift their T-shirts. When they
said no, they said 'Fine' and motored off down the road in their
motorboat."&raquo;<blockquote

access</blockquote></blockquote>

Ugh.
