<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;Perhaps most grotesque in this postmodern calculus of political repression is the moral blindness
displayed towards the record of colonialism. For most of the last century, vast swathes of the planet
remained under direct imperial European rule, enforced with the most brutal violence by states that
liked to see themselves as democracies. But somehow that is not included as the third leg of
20th-century tyranny, along with Nazism and communism. There is a much-lauded Black Book of
Communism, but no such comprehensive indictment of the colonial record.&raquo;<p
>--<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,790476,00.html">"The battle for history:
The now routine equation of Stalin and Hitler both distorts the past and limits the
future"</a></blockquote>
I am amazed at how easily the concept of "history" has changed from being hagiography of grandees (where knowing history meant knowing who bravely invaded/defended what when), to estimating numbers of dead (where knowing history means being able to play a game where everyone sits around and says "Oh yeah, well what about the <em>N</em> million dead in...", with points being scored for bigger numbers and more undeservedly obscure locales.
<p>One of these days, history might mean the study of past ideas, instead of the assembly of stirring ethnic/national myths.</p>

Or to the holocaust.<br> </p><p>I understand that colonialism was extremely brutal historically.  The mass murder and enslavement of non-European races comes to mind.  But, among "European" powers, the US was the last to abolish slavery, and that was in 1865.

I'll try to be more clear.<br> <br>1.  Are you asserting that the US worker's relationship (via Walmart) with workers in China is not colonial?<br> <br>2.  While Walmart is not responsible for the actions of Chinese elites, it pays money to said elites, and certainly does not aim to depose them.  So I agree with you that one cannot blame solely the owners of Walmart for the sorry situation of Chinese workers.<br> <br>3.  Do you not agree that these "evil American Capitalists" exist, and are powerful?  Have you been paying attention to the actions of, say, any oil company?  I am not asserting that American elites are somehow <i>more evil</i> than other powerful elites around the world.  They are simply more powerful, and so have a greater evil impact.<br> <br>4.  What to do about this situation?  I don't have a formula, but I *am* working on it.  Here are a few suggestions that, while obviously of limited impact, don't involve going out on a limb:<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; a)  Use and support free software (I imagine, given the forum, that you're on to this one already)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; b)  Buy food at farmers markets, from organic farmers (or via subscriptions, if possible)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; c)  Don't consume what you feel you don't need (obviously, this is a personal judgment call)<br> <br>5.  I think there are a few important things that people need to realize:<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; a) They don't need bosses (whether corporate bosses or government bosses) to tell them what to do.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; b) People are all human, and have the same needs and rights, wherever they happen to have been born, and whoever their parents are.<br> <br>If we can get everyone to really internalize these two points, those evil power elites will come tumbling down.<br>

The land has been ruined by Mao's population/industrial push, and the continuing industrial activities.<br> <br> <i>Now, I wouldn't be at all opposed to a moral stand where we stop trading with the slave masters of China, much as there was an almost universal stand not to trade with South Africa a few years ago.

The Chinese would just sell into those markets that would buy and we'd have to buy from Taiwan or Thailand or wherever.</i> <br> <br>US residents consume many of the manufactured goods of the world.  In any case, we don't have to wait for the government to tell us to boycott -- we can make choices for ourselves.  I personally suggest trying to purchase only those goods manufactured in decent conditions (US union labor is one approximation).<br> <br> <i>Do you aim to depose the Chinese elites? Or Wal-Mart? Or both?</i> <br> <br>Yes, yes, and yes.<br> <br> <i>Somehow, there's no interest in freeing slaves when a Socialist Government are the slaveholders.</i> <br> <br>On the contrary, I think that State Capitalism (the government is your boss) is much worse than the US variety.  At least in the US you can pretty much do your own thing as long as you don't threaten power.  (If you do, though, watch out -- you might end up like Fred Hampton Sr. (not that I am endorsing his politics; I'm just using his death as an example of how freedom in the US has limits)).<br> <br> <i>I believe Capitalists are not uniformly evil. I believe they are kept in check in many instances by countervailing factors, like competition and government restriction.</i> <br> <br>They want to make money.  They do not care about what happens to you, or to me, or to your family.  That they are kept in check to some extent by other power centers does not change their evil intent.  Of course, there are a few people around who own companies who are still nice people, but they definitely are the exception, from what I can see.  In fact, I have seen people I know get much less nice after they get more power within a company.<br> <br>Of course, (as the refrain goes), it's more complicated than just State vs Capital, because powerful businessmen tend to rotate through influential positions in the State, and because elections are financed by private Capital.  So you get situations where the Clinton administration helped out the banking industry, the Bush administration is helping out the oil industry, etc., while at other points these people are expanding the power of the State at the expense of business (examples of the latter being Clinton's attempted health care nationalization, and Bush's expanded police powers).<br> <br>Notice that nowhere in this struggle does anyone push for rights for individuals, other than those individuals themselves, and grassroots organizations like the ACLU and EFF.<br> <br>Notice also how this points out how much of a crock US Libertarianism is -- remove the State from the equation, and private Capital will ride roughshod over everyone.<br> <br> <i>The evil done by the likes of the Chinese elite, and other despots, is much more problematic and more centralized. The Chinese elite control more power and influence than any Oil company or Wal-Mart could ever dream of wielding.</i> <br> <br>The owners of those companies *do* dream of having that kind of power and influence.  Some more mergers, and they could start to get there -- this is why States sometimes oppose mega-mergers.<br> <br>And in certain contexts (Nigeria, for instance) oil companies *do* actually have as much power as the State.  Sometimes they are backed up by US military power (subject to the tensions I mentioned earlier).<br> <br> <i>A sensible bottom-up approach to the problems of the world.</i> <br> <br>Lately I've gotten very interested in <a href="http://struggle.ws/" title="struggle.ws">anarchism</a struggle.ws>.  It's all about bottom-up problem solving, based on personal responsibility, while acknowledging our existence as social beings.  It's about not expecting people to do things *for* us, and about asserting our ability to solve the problems ourselves, democratically.<br>
