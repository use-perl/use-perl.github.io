<p>Dear Log,
<p>So I was at Target the other day.  Usually I only go to Target when I need lawn chairs and/or socks, but this time I was looking to buy a new television for cheap.
<p>Target looks pretty much like it always has, but this time I noted something interesting:  for N years running, they have had low-end portable CD players going for about $50.  But the last time I looked, they were just plain old CD players. <em>Now</em> they can also play CDRWs, and discs full of MP3s.  An interesting development!  I wonder when there'll be OGG support.  I don't care much about the whole patent status thing, but OGG is just better as an audio format -- better fidelity in less space.
<p>In other MP3 news, I'm going to try wrapping up the Apache::MP3 localization project soon.  Of course, there will be new language modules trickling in forever, but I think I'm basically done with the changes that needed to be made to the core of Apache/MP3.pm itself.  As I expected, support for right-to-left languages was the hard part, requiring several changes and an occasional hack.</p>

<h2>Not the $50 models but</h2>

I was browsing at <i>jrandom-big-box-retailer</i> at
similar items and I seem to recall that at least
one of the mid- or high-end models (I want to say
made by either Sony or Panasonic, but I'm not sure) had updatable firmware, presumable to support
future formats.

<h2>Now what would be really cool...</h2>

Is an MP3 (or OGG<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... personally, I haven't checked that out yet) player installed in your car with a CD changer in the trunk.  Load up 6 CD's (~1400 songs) and NEVER have to worry about music while you're driving again.
