<p>Dear Log,
<p>So some kook told <a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-02-25/panettone_head_monster.jpg">me</a> to make myself
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/6VG380LA3B02">an Amazon wishlist.</a>
So I did, and I absentmindedly stuck on it some stuff I'd been eyeing for a while, including 
<cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679748199">Voltaire's Bastards: The Dictatorship of Reason in the West</a></cite>,
which <a href="http://substitute.livejournal.com/">Ignatz</a> had recommended to me.
<p>And SOMEONE bought it for me!  I just got it!  Spooooooky.

<p>And I've started reading the book and it's weeeeeird.  I love it!

<p>Also: <a href="http://www.buzzle.com/showImage.asp?image=735">"Damn you, gay marriage!"</a></p>

<h2>whats with the bigotry over that side of the pond?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2004-02-26T11:05:30</h3>
I have been following the Gay Marriage row and wondered how it became an issue.
<p>
If democrats are supposedly moderate or even (god forbid, left-wing) why haven't they cried foul?
</p><p>
wierd country...
</p><p>
I thought of getting putting an amazon wishlist on my website but I don't think I'd like the underwhelming response.

</p><p>I set mine up just so <em>I</em> could remember what I wanted to get and/or requist from the public library, when I get around to it.  That, I think, is the best reason to have this listy thing.  I never expected anyone (but me) would actually buy me anything off it!

<p>*nods* Same here.</p>

<p>I have pointed people to it in the past when they asked what they could get me, but on the whole, I use it to keep track of interesting books that I might get around to buying when I have the spare cash and time.</p>

<h2>nemesis sharing</h2>

<p>I was thinking of loaning you my copy... that was a good one but he has tended to repeat himself since that book.</p>

<p>Incidentally, you and JRS share the same nemesis. Just yesterday he proclaimed in a speech that <a href="http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&amp;DocID=4044" title="www.gg.ca">globalization is dead</a www.gg.ca>.</p>
