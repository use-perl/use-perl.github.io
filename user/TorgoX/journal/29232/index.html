<p><p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;The Indian newspaper market is one of the healthiest in the
world, with hundreds of daily titles - and it's growing. Total newspaper
circulation rose by 8 per last year, according to the World
Association of Newspapers. Over the same period, UK circulation fell
by 4.5 per cent. Indian sales are likely to continue climbing. With a
population around 1 billion, and millions of people migrating from the
countryside to the cities every year, new readers are being created by
the day. The country's literacy rate, currently running at around 60
per cent according to the World Bank, is rising; the economy is
growing; and India's educated middle class is expanding rapidly. The
main languages, including Hindi, Urdu and English, are gaining ground
at the expense of local dialects, which increases the potential
audience for the biggest papers. Most importantly of all, perhaps,
there are no constraints on press freedom, in contrast to other
emerging markets where economic reforms have not been accompanied by
greater democratic freedoms.&raquo;<blockquote

a target for the UK's newspaper groups."</a></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>Too bad the Indian press is repulsively jingoistic. Poor people are hilarious!  Especially when they've got nuclear weapons.

<p>Meanwhile,
