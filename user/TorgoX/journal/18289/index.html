<h2>How very sad</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nkuitse/">nkuitse</a> on 2004-04-12T02:28:09</h3>
I heard him perform several years ago in Ann Arbor and it was riveting, especially after enjoying <i>Swimming to Cambodia</i> so much.<br> <br>I felt bad when I heard of his death, but this story made me truly sad.  And angry:<br> <br> <blockquote><div> <i>The friendly audience that was left was slowly abandoning him, and he didn&#8217;t seem to care, or notice. The crowd was ever more unruly, like grade-schoolers taking advantage of the sub. People were again walking out, but now because they felt cheated. One of his visitors explained that she was a mother with young children, and on this her first night out in two months, she had come to see him. She wanted a show, she wanted theater. Who could blame her?</i> </div></blockquote> <br>But mostly sad: very, very sad.
