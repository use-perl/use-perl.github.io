<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;
orkut is a community of friends and trusted acquaintances that connects 
individuals through a social network that grows person by person.
<p>With orkut, you can catch up with old friends, make new acquaintances 
through people you trust, and maybe even find that certain someone you've 
been looking for everywhere.
<p>orkut helps you organize and attend events, join communities that share 
your interests, and find partners to participate in the activities you 
most enjoy.&raquo;</blockquote>
I don't like it.

<h2>A community of one</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gav/">gav</a> on 2004-01-25T04:40:22</h3>
I don't know anybody who uses one of these things (what do you do with them anyway?) so I worry that I'd have a community of one. Then I'd be sad.



<h2>Community of Solipsist Omphaloskeptics</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2004-01-25T07:19:13</h3>
<p>It could be worse.  It could be a <em>BLOGROLL</em>!</p>

&gt; Omphaloskeptics<br> <br>Cool, I didn't know there was a word for people who doubt the existence of their navels.<br>

<h2>two reactions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brev/">brev</a> on 2004-01-25T10:49:24</h3>
reaction #1: because the problem with online relationships is... not having enough of them?<br/><br/>reaction #2: I don't get social software but there are some for whom it makes sense. Maybe not the typical computer programmer.<br/><br/>I know one woman who manages her life through Friendster. Most of what she does depends on knowing people in the art world in a few cities. So having a registry of contacts, and her contacts' contacts, is a major asset. It's kind of a Napster of rolodexes.
