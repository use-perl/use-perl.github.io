<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;Hundreds of those discharged held high-level job specialties that required years of training and expertise, including 90 nuclear power engineers, 150 rocket and missile specialists and 49 nuclear, chemical, and biological warfare specialists.
<p>Eighty-eight linguists were discharged, including at least seven Arab language specialists.
<p>Elaine Donnelly of the Center for Military Readiness, a conservative advocacy group that opposes gays serving in the military, said the loss of gays and lesbians serving in specialized areas is irrelevant because they never should have been in those jobs in the first place.
<p>"We need to defend the law, and the law says that homosexuality is incompatible with military service," Donnelly said. "There is no shortage of people in the military, and we do not need people who identify themselves as homosexual."&raquo;

Even if you believe that gays should not be in the military for a practical reason, like fear of buggery in the barracks or in a foxhole, how that reflects on serving in an office somewhere where they don't have those logistical problems is beyond me.<br>
