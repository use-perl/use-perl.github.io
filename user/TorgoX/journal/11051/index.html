<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;You need a religious imagination to respond to the music of other religions. Jonathan Sacks expressed this well in his account of a
meeting with radical Muslims, including a senior Iranian Ayatollah. "We
established within minutes a common language, because we take certain
things very seriously: we take faith seriously, we take texts seriously.
It's a particular language that believers share."&raquo;<p
>--<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,908217,00.html">"Islam and us"</a></blockquote>
Must we actually assume it took massive "religious imagination" for a priest in one scriptural Semitic monotheistic religion to make sense of another scriptural Semitic monotheistic religion?  I'm sure he meant well, laudable goal, golf clap and all that; but from my post here at Slush Station Zero, that religious imagination seems to run the gamut from A to C.  Take some voodoo priests, Chan mugwumps, and Peyote Church folk and call me in the morning.

Sounds like the author of this article watched one too many Adrienne Barbeau movies.  Here's a brief excerpt (from memory) from <i> <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0094834" title="imdb.com">Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death </a imdb.com> </i>:
<blockquote><div>
<i>Visiting Feminist Anthropologist</i>: Why did the Barracuda women split away from the Pirhana women?
<p>
<i>Barracuda Woman</i>: The Pirahna women think it's OK to kill men and eat them with a white wine sauce!
</p><p>
<i>Visiting Feminist Anthropologist</i>: And you think that's wrong?
</p><p>
<i>Barracuda Woman</i>: Of course we think that's wrong!  You <i>always</i> use a red wine sauce with read meat.</p>
</div></blockquote>
Yup.  Takes a <i>lot</i> of imagination to span the differences between some belief systems....
