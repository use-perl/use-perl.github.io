<div class="span8">
<p>Dear Log,
<p>What I'd really like to be added to Perl:

<p>I'd like if there were a %C sprintf format that was like %g, but also did commafication on the integer part of the number(well, with a locale-specific thousands separator, so you get "." or " " as locale-appropriate).  So I can just do <tt>printf "That file uses %C bytes.\n", -s $filename;</tt> and have it say, for example, <em>That file uses 10,116,911 bytes</em>.
<br>(I know it would be a Good Thing if <em>all</em> of sprintf were rewritten to allow, say, overloading specific sprintf formats.  But I see reason to wait for that.  If I knew any C, I'd just have done this myself years ago and submitted the patch; but I don't know C.)

<p>Another thing I'd <em>really like:</em>

<p>I'd like if there were a file read-discipline that would auto-guess the encoding (at least as either UTF-8, UTF-16, or other), and also auto-guess the newline format.

<p><br>For some reason, I'm in a <a href="http://www.mind-set.com/html/pages/favpeopl.htm">particularly foul mood</a> today, so I hereby threaten to put an <a href="http://www.ushba.com/catalog/altai.html">ice-axe</a> thru the <a href="http://www.noah.org/trepan/">forehead</a> of anyone who wants to tell me that these things don't belong in the Perl core.

</p>

<h2>More Important</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-02-14T13:41:23</h3>
would be to finish implementing *all* of sprintf in perl's core.  For example, %g is broken in the version of sfio that MacPerl uses, and perl doesn't implement %g, though it implements many of the others.
<br>
<br>That said, %C seems like a decent idea to me, but it makes me think of what other formats we might want.  Maybe a format for HTML encoding or URI encoding of a string?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)/2
<br>



<h2>What *I* would really like...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2002-02-14T14:22:11</h3>
...is a working, stable thread model.
<p>
Occasionally I tinker with the notion of fork'ing some of my apps where I think I could get some extra speed, but then the reality of overhead hits me.</p>



<h2>too many choices</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2002-02-14T15:47:37</h3>
The alphabet is too small for the number of formats you might want.  (The example of memory given is wrong - memory you want to be displayed with 3 or 4 characters of accuracy and variable units automatically switching amongst B, KB, MB, GB,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...)
<br>
<br>I think that it would be better for printf to check whether the value to be printed is an object which has a printf method.  If it does, it gets called something like:
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $val-&gt;printf( width, prec, format, flags )
<br>
<br>That lets you roll your own and have as many formats as you have object types for each letter of the alphabet.



<h2>Encoding Detection</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-02-14T17:34:22</h3>
I've done this for UTF16/UCS2 (both little and big endian), UTF32/UCS4 (again, both ends<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-), and UTF8, using byte order marks, for XML::SAX::PurePerl. It should be fairly easy to extract the code and stuff into the I/O layer.
<br>
<br>But it really shouldn't go in perl core...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
