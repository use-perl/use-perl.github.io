<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;So the day after his interview appeared, the Turkish press launched a
fierce attack on Pamuk, branding him a traitor, accusing him of having
used the virtually illegal word genocide (although he had not) and
inviting 'civil society' to 'silence' him. Following several death
threats, he went into hiding abroad. He returned to Turkey late last
spring, hoping it had all blown over. It had not. Last August, an
Istanbul public prosecutor charged him with the 'public denigration of
Turkish identity'. The trial is set for 16 December. If convicted,
Pamuk faces three years in prison.
<p>[...]'These laws should be changed, and changed fast, before the EU
and the international community puts pressure on Turkey to do so. We
have to learn to reform before others warn us.'&raquo;<blockquote

>"I stand by my words. And even more, I stand by my right to say
them...'"</a></blockquote></blockquote>
Yes, it would behoove Turkey to move away from having persistently
oppressive laws, and instead join the warm community of nations that
do their <a href=

>pouty oppressing</a> either off the books, with armies, or with a
persistent parade of temporary oppressive laws.  Progress, not perfection!

<p>Meanwhile, in the Little Britain neighborhood of Farce-on-Avon:

>&laquo;British Asians despair of [Hizb ut-Tahrir's] cultish recruits. On the

men at her university. 'They thought that the way to achieving Islamic
nirvana was to grow a beard, pepper their talk with Muslim-Arabic and
aggressively illustrate to the "misguided" sister how she is
contributing to the genocide of her fellow Muslims by choosing to wear
trousers, make-up and, heaven forbid, have non-Muslim male
friends!'&raquo;<blockquote
