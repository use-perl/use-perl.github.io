<p>Dear All,
<p>Six months ago, I wrote a GreaseMonkey extension:
<a href="http://masculinehygiene.com/sburke/Text_size_defaulter.user.js"
>Text Size Defaulter</a>.

<p>It's meant for use on web sites with insanely small type, as often
happens when WEB DESIGN GURUS set their pages' text sizes to "font-size:
10px", which happens to look good for them with their monitors and
monitor resolutions (and their designerly disinterest in actual
content), but look like tiny little squiggles to me and my particular
screen/cornea/retina geometry.  However, that user-script would work
when the text-sizes were set in actual style sheets, but would fail
when it was set in style="..." attributes, and a few other
circumstances besides -- this was because it worked only by simple CSS
rule injection.

<p><a href=
"http://interglacial.com/temp/Text_size_defaulter_dammit.user.js"
>But now I've rewritten it</a>!  Now it actually traverses the whole
doctree and absolutely enforces a single text size (the browser's
default size, in fact) on every single node in the tree, dammit.

<p>There's still a circumstance where it doesn't work: when text is
added to the page after it's initially finished rendering.  In my
experience, however, such things happen only with DOM-generated
menu items, where I don't entirely mind the text being too small.

<p>By a stroke of irony, the new version of Firefox has solution
to much of my problem-space, in the form of the <a href=
"http://interglacial.com/temp/minimum_font_size.png"
>"minimum font size" setting</a> under Preferences: Content:
Fonts &amp; Colors: Advanced, (a.k.a.
"font.minimum-size.x-western" in about:config).  This defaults to
None, but you can merrily set it to me a bit smaller than the normal
font size.

<p>However, there's two cases that my plugin catches:  1) situations
where you want the font-size restriction to be site-specific (whereas
the Preferences thing is global), and 2) situations where the problem
isn't overly-small text, but overly-large (whereas there's no
<em>maximum</em> font size prefs).

>Enjoy</a>!</p>

Galeon has had the "minimum font size" setting available since roughly the beginning of time.<br><br>Too bad the developers have <a href="http://galeon.sourceforge.net/Main/GaleonFuture" title="sourceforge.net">discontinued Galeon</a sourceforge.net>.

Mmmm interesting.  Are there other features in Galeon that you wish Firefox had?

Conveniently hung off the "Settings" menu are:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; * load images<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * always<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * from current server only<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * never<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; * use own fonts<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; * use own colors<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; * allow java<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; * allow javascript<br>

<h2>Firefox has this built-in</h2>

In the advanced font settings, there is a minimum size setting. It's been there for quite a while...

That's what I said in my entry.  Reading is fundamental!
