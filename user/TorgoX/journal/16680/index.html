<p>Dear Log,
<p>As a charming rumination over the year that was, 2002 (and its repeat, 2003),
I note this article:
<a href="http://www.buffalobeast.com/article.php?path=2002/09/&article=01_0">"THE BEAST 50: Most Loathsome People in America, 2002"</a>,
containing:
<blockquote>
<p>&laquo;
<br>43. TOM BROKAW
<br>Misdeeds:   There's just something about this guy that makes you want to reach for a sharp object every time you turn on the news... Maybe it's his heavily marketed image of smug self-righteousness, or maybe it's the fact that The Greatest Generation, his vapid catch-phrase stretched to book length, was a monstrous best-seller. Hunter Thompson once said that Nixon's idea of a good joke was a paraplegic who couldn't reach high enough to vote Democratic, but Brokaw is a person that it's hard to imagine has any idea at all of a good joke.
<p>Aggravating Factor:   He commented on NBC Nightly News that while the Office of Homeland Security might have sounded like a name from a "totalitarian regime," the 9/11 attacks "proved that something in America has to change."
<p>Aesthetic:   The quirky fourth in a golfing party of Dupont executives.
<p>32. THOMAS FRIEDMAN
<br>Misdeeds:   Mustachioed New York Times columnist who is celebrated in polite society for his "thoughtful" and "brave" political positions, for instance the decision to run a column entitled "Give War a Chance." Believes the entire world should be forced, militarily if necessary, to accept the American model of prosperity, which he calls "The Golden Straitjacket."
<p>Aggravating Factor:   Author of perhaps the worst and most mentally displeasing metaphors in the history of the English language, terms like "BisCzarism" and "The Electronic Herd."
<p>Aesthetic:   Bit actor on 70's cop show; Buick salesman.
<br>&raquo;</blockquote>

I wish the eager and crusading American newsmedia to re-evaluate its policy of hiring the retarded.</p>

I thought the Olsen twins writeup was freaking hilarious!



<h2>I Like Brokaw</h2>

And I am unashamed to say it.
