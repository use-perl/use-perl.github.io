<p>Dear Log,
<p>Are there any other ideas, besides fixing pod2html and implementing //, that people are hesitant to deal with because Tom C didn't like them?<p>I was thinking today that in the past, avoiding Tom's hysterias was a necessary thing; but now that Tom has apparently shuffled off to wherever it is that hysterics eventually shuffle off to, if there's any ideas about which all anyone can remember is "ohyeah, Tom didn't/wouldn't like that", I think it's time to dust them off and give them new consideration.</p>

<p>Last I saw him, Tom was waxing nostalgic about his days in musical theatre.</p>

<p>Musical theatre? Like...Barbara Streisand tunes or more like Gilbert and Sullivan? Both present an equally horrific mental image<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<h2>Did you mean...</h2>

<p>Did you mean C&lt;??&gt;?  I always agreed with his analysis on that issue, but it's been awhile since I read it.</p>

<p>I had a title for this message called "// ??" but slash doesn't like it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Brent Dax <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2002-04/msg01669.html" title="mpe.mpg.de">submitted a patch</a mpe.mpg.de> to p5p to implement a Perl6-style<nobr> <wbr></nobr>// operator. It wasn't applied due to the code freeze, but I think Hugo is considerating it for 5.9.



<h2>Tom and //</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2002-05-03T13:21:42</h3>
To be fair, when<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>//</tt> and<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>//=</tt> were last proposed, they were in the form of <tt>|||</tt> and <tt>|||=</tt>.  Tom rejected them out-of-hand because they were unperlish, and Larry rejected them because they were too difficult to read and mistype.
<p>
Now that Larry's re-blessed the idea as<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>//</tt>, things are different, and that's mostly because of a simple respelling of <tt>|||</tt> to make it more perlish.
</p><p>
But Tom did drive a lot of people away from working on Pod for a long time.  Unfortunately.  He did have a point, and that point seems to have lived on: Pod is it's own format, and should be treated as such.  Trying to re-invent LaTeX, HTML, XML, DocBook or anything else through Pod isn't going to work; nor is switching Perl's internal documentation format to anything but Pod (or something fundementally Pod-like) ever going to happen -- for good reason.</p>
