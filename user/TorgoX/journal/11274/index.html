<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;Injured dignity lies at the heart of all rebellions. Throughout history human beings have revealed an
enormous capacity to bear, and cope with the harshest forms of oppression and exploitation. It is only
when they perceive these as "injustice", however; when the implicit or explicit compact between
oppressor and oppressed appears to have been shattered and violated by the oppressors; when the
exercise of power appears lawless and arbitrary - it is then that people rise up. 
<p>Yet for the Arabs, as galling and bitter as the sense of injured dignity has been and continues to be, it has also been disabling, creating a situation and mindset in which their choices seemed to be limited
to either suicidal vengeance or abject and bitter hopelessness. It remains to be seen whether the war
in Iraq will put the Arab masses on a new trajectory, one in which they fight to win, rather than just
to die while maintaining some sense of their basic human dignity. But whatever the course of the war
in the coming days or weeks, for the moment the Arab masses have two things going for them: They
are not mice, and they are not alone.&raquo;<p

of Arab humiliation, says distinguished Egyptian journalist Hani Shukrallah</blockquote>
Having a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/23/magazine/23GURU.html">regal sense of ethnic-religious entitlement</a> must be such a <a href="http://www.mentalhealth.com/dis1/p21-pe07.html">burden.</a>  But ya <em>gotta</em> have a hobby!</p>
