<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;In the year since I was forced to leave the country, the situation in Zimbabwe has worsened in every respect. More people are going hungry, with nearly two-thirds of the population reliant upon international food aid in recent months. State brutality has become more systematic and more widespread. Thousands of young Zimbabweans have been trained in torture at the militia camps and are inflicting their skills on the population, particularly anyone suspected of supporting the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change.

<p>[...]There are so many Zimbabweans who go from house to house looking for any kind of work. They will work for food or for a T-shirt," says Dorcas Bogatsu, a secretary in Francistown [over in Botswana]. "And they are well educated. Their English is good. It is very sad. Zimbabwe used to be a rich country."&raquo;
<p>--<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,1218999,00.html">"Weary Zimbabweans seek better life"</a></blockquote>
<p>First it  was just "common sense" that ohwell, Africa is always a horror show, that's just Africa.  Look out for other places (Colombia?) being silently nudged into the same category.
