<p>Dear Log,
<p>I'm bleaaaaary.  The combination of over-60F temperatures, merely 4-hour nights, and blaring sunlight (instead of <a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-03-25_floats/overcast">the usual murk</a>) has 
basically kept me from really sleeping for about... three days?  four days?  I'm very distracted and can't think straight.
<p>Let's hope the weather breaks and we get back to the usual 50F and drizzle.
I don't trust myself to program when I'm this spaced out.</p>

you're not complaining ? *stares incredulously*
<p>I'd give a lot for more hours of sunlight and a LOT more warmth (I'm in the UK, it's still not warm enough to suit me)</p>

When the sun never really sets it pisses you off because, well, dammit, it SUPPOSED TO!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Seriously, it totally messes with your internal clock and then you're plunged into almost constant darkness by November....it's really manic if you haven't lived in such latitudes for years or as a kid.

I hate just living north of Seattle, where in the summer it doesn't get dark until after 10 p.m. sometimes.  I can only imagine the horror of 4-hour nights.

NIGHT? What is this thing you call 'night'? In a week or two it will still be bright enough at midnight to read a book by and, even though the sun technically 'sets', the constant glow of the sun is just below the horizon. It's bizarre to be standing outside at 2am  after having beers and whatnot thinking that it's 6am<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I don't think I'll ever get used to the manic swings of light and dark here.

Yeah.  I get it quite a bit worse in WA than in MA (a good hour or more before sunset, and like you said, more of a glow for longer even after sunset), but it pales in comparison to what you get.  I don't envy you.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Oh, I'm sure I'll get used to it eventually<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) But it is really odd, I'll give it that. It's very disorienting to come out of a movie at 10pm with sunlight that you would swear was 5 or 6pm in Boston. Fortunately, I can sleep through just about anything. The dark november is what is really no fun though.

Personally I like all the dark months.  I find it very <a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2003-12-27/from_platform" title="interglacial.com">restful</a interglacial.com>,
not depressing -- not generally at least.
