<blockquote><div>Percentage change in central London's average rush-hour car speed since a &#194;&#163;5 toll was imposed there in February : +111</div></blockquote>
<p>Woohoo! If I read this correctly, it means that the average speed has gone up from 9mph to 20mph. Wow. It's not been that fast since the 1800s (Yes, IIRC it was about 11mph around 1900)</p>
<p>What it doesn't tell you is whether the traffic has slowed down outside the congestion charging zone, because the same journeys now being taken via different routes, avoiding the centre and displacing the traffic outwards.</p>
<p>The congestion charging zone is almost exactly the play area of the game "The Getaway". Although even with the charge, real traffic levels are still much higher than in the game. There's probably only 2 places in Central London where you can reliably break the 30mph speed limit by &gt;10mph - the Euston Road Underpass, and Lower/Upper Thames Street (a road that runs along the north bank of the Thames from the Tower of London towards the Houses of Parliament)</p>



<h2>One of the Tappet Brothers doesn't own a car?</h2>

<p>OK, I know there's a lot of important things there, but this:</p><blockquote><div> <i>Number of motor vehicles owned by Tom Magliozzi, co-host of NPR's Car Talk : 0 </i> </div></blockquote>just floored me.
<p>What about the Dodge Dart he keeps talking about?  (Well, I guess that was in the past tense.)  But there's that car he's supposedly driven 100,000 miles without an oil change to see what would happen.  (Probably somebody else's.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>
<p>OK, so how many cars does Ray own?</p>

Well, they do live in Boston, where a car can often be more of a liability than an asset. I've seen their offices, and it would be *very* hard to find parking unless there's some super-secret underground garage we don't see.
