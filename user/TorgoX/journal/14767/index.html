<p>Dear Log,
<p>Somebody wrote to me the other day asking about how/whether they could memoize Locale::Maketext language handles in a mod_perl system they're writing under.  I said how (altho the speed benefits are probably miniscule), but I also gave them my standard advice on such matters, which is this:
<p>If you're worrying about page load-times, install mod_gzip before you start fretting over optimizing Perl.  Secondly, tell your web designers to buy, read, absorb, and obey Zeldman's book <cite>Designing with Web Standards</cite>.  This is not about fretting over HTML/XHTML distinctions, but about using CSS instead of &lt;table&gt; abominations.  Using CSS in new pages/sites, instead of using table hell, will make your HTML saner for the programmers to deal with, and faster for transfer.

<p>Yes, embedded tables can cause clients on slow machines to <b>think real hard</b> before rendering the page.  Most browsers need to see the end table tag (&lt;/table&gt;) before they will display anything on the page.  Therefore, if the page can be redesigned so that there are a series of smaller tables, unembedded tables near
the top of the page, those tables will be visible on the client-side sooner.  This is a good trick to use if you have a giant, spreadsheet-looking thing that you need to generate.   CSS can and does help in many, but not all, situations.  I've become quite attached to CSS, foregoing my support for older browsers.
</p><p>gzipping the page before it leaves apache seems like a waste of resources unless the page is large (let's say over 50K).  Otherwise, the overhead of gzipping and ungziping will probably consume an transmission speed gains.

mod_gzip had logic in it (last time I checked) to avoid compressing files that were under a certain limit.  whatever the limit was, I believe it was put in place because compressing small files actually ends up with a larger file in the end.<br> <br><br/><br/>I'm not sure how mod_deflate does it in apache 2.0, though.<br/><br/>at any rate, compression is about saving bandwidth and not necessarily about saving client or server resources or speeding up a site.
