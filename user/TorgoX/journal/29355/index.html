<p><p>Dear Chat Log,
<p><b><i>TorgoX:</i></b> &nbsp;
And then I dreamed I found a hundred dollar bill and then I dreamed
I was going through a stack of Commodore 64 disks but then I woke up
because Leu was all <a href=
"http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2005-10-12_Leu/Leu_belly"
>PLAY WITH ME</a> so I got up and gave him catnip.

<p><b><i>Consarnit:</i></b> &nbsp;
But I have already suggested that the democratic argument implies a
necessary condition, namely, that the people must be capable of
deliberating and choosing on the basis of knowledge, that they must
have access to authentic information, and that, on this. basis, their
evaluation must be the result of autonomous thought.

<p><b><i>TorgoX:</i></b> &nbsp;
And I tried to get back to sleep but then he was knocking my
eyeglasses off the nightstand over and over and I was like NO DO
KITTY, NO DO, but he's a bit unclear on cause and effect and so just
went and chased a rubber band.

<p><b><i>Consarnit:</i></b> &nbsp;
The authorities in education, morals, and psychology are vociferous
against the increase in juvenile delinquency; they are less vociferous
against the proud presentation, in word and deed and pictures, of ever
more powerful missiles, rockets, bombs--the mature delinquency of a
whole civilization.

<p><b><i>TorgoX:</i></b> &nbsp;
Then I doodled some <a href=
"http://interglacial.com/user/sburke/pub/PostScript/no.ps" >PostScript
code</a> in my little notebook de esquisse de bosquejo y pwÃÂ©s I fell
asleep kinda but I was sorta really just thinking in PostScript when I
was asleep and that's not fun.  3 1 ROLL, 4 -2 ROLL EXCH POP OMG WTF
BBQ and stuff over and over, in <a href=
"http://bathsheba.com/news/index.html"
>four dimensions</a>.

<p><b><i>Consarnit:</i></b> &nbsp;
Consequently, persuasion through discussion and the equal
presentation of opposites (even where it is really, equal) easily lose
their liberating force as factors of understanding and learning; they
are far more likely to strengthen the established thesis and to repel
the alternatives.

<p><b><i>TorgoX:</i></b> &nbsp;
Yeah but so then I tried reading a bit of that big Peter Norvig
<cite>Case Studies in Common Lisp</cite> in bed, propping it up on my
chest, but the weight of it was COLLAPSING MY LUNGS and that thing is
so heavy it should come with a hand truck.

<p><b><i>Consarnit:</i></b> &nbsp;
The political locus of tolerance has changed: while it is more or less
quietly and constitutionally withdrawn from the opposition, it is made
compulsory behavior with respect to established policies.

<p><b><i>TorgoX:</i></b> &nbsp;
So I got up and went to the diner with the laptop but there were like
practically no <a
href="http://www.wordyard.com/dmz/digicult/anderson-motel-5-10-95.html"
>outlets</a> anywhere and my battery was low so I ended up practically
having to sit in the waitresses' little holding pen area just so my
lapotp's power cord could reach anything.  But that was okay because every few seconds 
they were all like MORE ICE TEA SIR and I was like <em>yessum!</em>

<p><b><i>Consarnit:</i></b> &nbsp;
In the interplay of theory and practice, true and false solutions
become distinguishable--never with the evidence of necessity, never as
the positive, only with the certainty of a reasoned and reasonable
chance, and with the persuasive force of the negative.

<p><b><i>TorgoX:</i></b> &nbsp;
But I was a bit distracted by all the hustle and hubbub, or maybe it
was just that I had set my desktop wallpaper to a 60fps
<a href=
"http://www.fredcamper.com/Film/BrakhageS.html"
>Brakhage thing</a>.  But I got some <a href=
"http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/sterling/index.blog?entry_id=1452495"
>coding</a> done anyway.

<p><b><i>Consarnit:</i></b> &nbsp;
But in its struggle with history, art subjects itself to history:
history enters the definition of art and enters into the distinction
between art and pseudo-art. Thus it happens that what was once art
becomes pseudo-art.

<p><b><i>TorgoX:</i></b> &nbsp;
I call it the BRAKhage Show Starring BRAKhage!

<p><b><i>Consarnit:</i></b> &nbsp;
Peace is redefined as necessarily, in the prevailing situation,
including preparation for war (or even war) and in this Orwellian
form, the meaning of the word 'peace' is stabilized.

<p><b><i>TorgoX:</i></b> &nbsp;
You sir are the worst bot I have EVER written.
