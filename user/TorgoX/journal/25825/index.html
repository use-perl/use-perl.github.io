<p>Dear Log,
<p>When post-humans fight:

<blockquote>&laquo;Prospero
spread his arms in a conciliatory gesture. "An archetypal
quest narrative must be kept simple. To burden it with
<em>technicalities</em>&nbsp;--&nbsp;"

<p>Sachio inclined his head briefly, fingertips to forehead,
downloading information from the polis library. "Do you have any idea
what archetypal narratives <em>are</em>?"

<p>"Messages from the gods, or from the depths of the soul; who can
say? But they encode the most profound and mysterious&nbsp;--&nbsp;"

<p>Sachio cut him off impatiently. "They're the product of a few chance
attractors in flesher neurophysiology. Whenever a more complex or
subtle story was disseminated through an oral culture, it would
eventually degenerate into an archetypal narrative. Once writing was
invented, they were only ever created deliberately by fleshers who
failed to understand what they were. If all of antiquity's greatest
statues had been dropped into a glacier, they would have been reduced
to a predictable spectrum of spheroidal pebbles by now; that does not
make the spheroidal pebble the pinnacle of the artform. What you've
created is not only devoid of truth, it's devoid of aesthetic merit."

<p>Prospero was stunned. He looked around the room expectantly, as if
waiting for someone to speak up in defence of the
<em>Ballad.</em>&raquo;
