<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;Middle Americans, especially the more church-inclined, cream over a good
blubbering.  Just remember Jimmy Swaggert's confessions, or the Jim
Bakker bawl-fests. I think, in some sick Texas-Christian way, Bush
actually enjoys this. I think he enjoys sinnin' 'n squirtin' <em>[i.e., sobbing publicly]</em>
every once in a while--and so does his constituency.

<p>This is a democracy, and Rumsfeld forgot that not only does he serve a
barbaric, torture-happy population, but also that this same population
is incredibly craven, sentimental and self-deluded. They wanted Rummie
to torture the Iraqis and at the same time have the Iraqis be
grateful...and mean it.
&raquo;
<p>--<a href="http://www.exile.ru/190/letter_from_america.html">"Baseball,
Apple Pie and Torture: The American Way"</a></blockquote>

<p>My pet theory: the sheer ruthlessness of US society (unless you happen to be rich and/or a corporation) is the root of this meanness.  It's either that or something to do with toilet training.
<p>Meanwhile,

<p><blockquote>&laquo;Like everyone else these days, Savage was fixated on Iraq and the Abu
Ghraib prison abuse scandal. 

[...]

"These are tough interrogations?" Savage asked. "My father put me
through tougher interrogations when I was 16!" [...] He couldn't understand
why liberals were so outraged. After all, he said, the acts of sexual
humiliation and degradation that took place in Abu Ghraib were no more
perverted than typical homosexual behavior. Try to follow his tortured
logic: Savage was saying he didn't mind the Abu Ghraib abuses because
they were good clean fun, like gay sex, which he openly abhors. 


<p>Savage continued the psychological striptease, peeling off more
layers of mainstream conservatism to expose his raging right-wing id.
Though he has long billed himself as the original "compassionate
conservative," his brand of conservatism does not share George W. Bush's
pretense of caring about Muslim hearts and minds, much less lives. It
appears that for Savage, the war in Iraq has nothing to do with
spreading democracy or respecting human rights. It is about asserting
American power by any means necessary, and screw what anyone else
thinks. Predictably, and sadly, this notion went over well with the
audience. When Savage blurted out, "Does anyone in this crowd give a
shit about the Iraqis?" he was answered with a deafening
"NO!"&raquo;

laziest fascist"</a></blockquote>
