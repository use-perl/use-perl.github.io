<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;The dangers of national divinity scarcely require explanation. Japan went to war in the 1930s convinced, like George Bush, that it possessed a heaven-sent mission to "liberate" Asia and extend the realm of its divine imperium. It would, the fascist theoretician Kita Ikki predicted: "light the darkness of the entire world". Those who seek to drag heaven down to earth are destined only to engineer a hell.&raquo;<p
>--<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1007813,00.html">"America is a religion":</a> US leaders now see themselves as priests of a divine mission to rid the world of its demons</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't sound like this'll even be one of those hot sex cults, either.  Dang.
<p>But maybe I can make some money starting an "Institute", and clean up on corpoerate donations.  I'll just have to give it a too-long pretentious name, like "The George Washington National Voters' Free Enterprise Integrity Institute for Good Family U.S. Constitutional Studies of Theology Under God".
<p>$$$ !
<p>Gimme.</p>

I'm feeling cranky today but that "think" piece is retarded. Simplistic view of the USA, supported by random quotes and at most one real event of dubious interpretation anyway.<br> <br>America is a religious country, and a patriotic country. Consequently a lot of Americans will rationalize their country's behaviour in terms that are religious, or at least reminiscent of religion.<br> <br>But that wouldn't have stretched to 800 words, I guess.

I found the article a bit fuzzy too, but best I could make out, Monbiot's idea is that the pseudo-religious rationalizations are taking on a life of their own, becoming excercises in community thoughtlessness even beyond what one wolud expect from popular rationalizations.

<p>But then, I've always thought that Durkeim's notion of religion (which only partially matches the normal meaning of the English word "religion") teetered on referring more to modern nationalism or fascism than to modern religions.  Example quote from Durkheim:
</p><blockquote><div>"religion is something eminently social. Religious representations
are collective representations which express collective realities; the
rites are a manner of acting which take rise in the midst of assembled
groups and which are destined to excite, maintain, or recreate certain
mental states in these groups."</div></blockquote>
That's from Durkheim's <cite>The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life</cite>.
