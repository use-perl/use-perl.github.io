<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;[...]To stay ahead of domestic competitors, Geissbuhler decided to put his
hardware skills online. "If I had outsourced the work, I would have
spent most of my time explaining to the programmer the difference
between a left-hand and a right-hand window crank," he says. So he built
homewindowrepair.com himself, using, among other tools, a language
called Perl. His training came from the book Sam's Teach Yourself Perl
in 24 Hours and from experimentation with programs like Adobe's GoLive.
It helped that he had studied Fortran in college.

<p>If your value in the job marketplace is years of experience--whether in
publishing or bond trading or retailing or drug research--you may yet
wind up with a pink slip at any time. If you are fresh out of school
with a programming degree, you have to compete with low-price talent
overseas. Marry the two kinds of skills, though, and you can thrive in a
global, digital age.&raquo;

I'm always looking for mentions of <i>Teach Yourself Perl in 24 Hours</i> in the press, but what an odd one this is.
<p>
For one, it's in a business forum and not the usual techie places to find it.  For two the guy's located in Birmingham, MI which is about 3 miles down the road from me.  What a circuitous route to find a local success story!</p>
