<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;Perhaps, now that he has performed his American survey, LÃÂ©vy will once
more focus his attention on Europe, where the real drama of the 21st
century West seems to be taking shape. After all, no filmmaker has
been murdered on Sunset Boulevard by an Islamic fundamentalist, as the
Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh was in the streets of
Amsterdam. American politicians and political cartoonists have not
been forced into hiding, as they have been in Holland and Denmark,
because of Islamic death threats. No American writers have been tried
for "inciting hatred" against a religion whose more rabid
practitioners threaten to wipe them off the face of the Earth, as is
the case in France and Italy. And if megachurches fascinate and appall
LÃÂ©vy, then the new mosque currently being proposed for London, which
is slated to hold 70,000 people, should certainly capture his
attention. And though we too had riots a decade ago, in Los Angeles,
they did not spread to every corner of the country as they did in
France. Nor did they go on for weeks.&raquo;<blockquote
>--<a href=
"http://www.laweekly.com/index.php?option=com_lawcontent&task=view&id=12415"
>"De Tocqueville, Part Deux"</a></blockquote></blockquote>
LÃÂ©vy himself is a hack, but that paragraph is interesting.
