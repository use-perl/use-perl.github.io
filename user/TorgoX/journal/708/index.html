<p><p>Dear Log,

<p>From Eno's diary (1995-12-07): "Rationality is what we do to organize the world, to make it possible to predict.  Art is the rehearsal for the inapplicability and failure of that <a href="http://www.rtqe.net/ObliqueStrategies/">process</a>."
<br>Since programming is about organizing for what you predict but always checking for whether it failed, does that make it artistic rationality?  Or just pure rationality that knows its limits?
<br>Eno also says: "if you don't call it art, you're likely to get a better result".

<p>Another Eno gem: "The computer [he was using some Mac and presumably MacOS 7.0.0.0.0.0.0] crashes so regularly, taking with it all the work since the last crash, that I have to find a way of reminding myself to save all the time.  I do this by balancing a book on my head while I'm working.  It falls off so often that I remember to save.  Interesting spin-off Ã¢â¬â in order to keep the book there at all I have to sit well, and move my eyes more than my head.  Now I'm starting to think this is the way to always use a computer."

<p>Music notes:
<br>The new <a href="http://www.jimmyeatworld.net">Jimmy Eat World</a> (/Bleed American/) is really infectiously good. 
<br>The new Laurie Anderson (/Life on a String/) is freaky and/or deaky, but in a zippy Tom Waits meets Nelson Riddle kinda way.
<br>The mp3s that I have that are holding up the best: Eno /Music for Airports/, especially track 1; and Grieg's "Ballade in G minor", and the two Elegies, "Last Spring" and "Wounded Heart". Very D&eacute;bussy-like, but much more sparse.
</p>
