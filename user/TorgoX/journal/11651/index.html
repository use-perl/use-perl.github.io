<p>Dear Log,

<br>Subject: Perl LWP: Poor quality web page selection
<p>I recently purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596001789">Perl &amp; LWP</a>, written by <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/user/sburke/images/me_yapc1999b.jpg">Sean Burke</a>.  The technical content is fine.
<br>However, I feel there was a poor selection with web pages in perl lwp examples in the book.
<br>Page 20 and several other pages give technical examples with the web page <a href="http://www.suck.com">http://www.suck.com</a>.
<br>I was dissapointed in Orielly books when I saw the content of www.suck.com.
<p>Please keep you books your clean.

<p>I don't even have the heart to write back to the poor zhlub and tell him that a working title of the book was "Writing Porn Spiders in Perl".
</p><p>It's a good thing I didn't use any un.int URLs, or I'd have loonies thinking I'm a puppet of the

<p>as it must take so much energy to get offended by suck.com to write to ORA, a rather tiny blip on the raft of obscenity, that he must not have time or the energy leftover to actually read your book. Why haven't these people exploded into bits over the live war coverage while watching little babies get shredded in 'unfortunate incidents'? Perhaps you should sign him up for some gay porn spam as it may help expand his universe or give him a seizure<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Life is so much easier when you're one of the damned. </p>

<p>You should go see  the new movie "Johnny English" when you get the chance as John Malcovich plays an evil frenchman with a bad attitude and an even worse accent who wants to turn the UK into a giant penal colony...the whole time I was thinking that the US should just do that only with fundys...and cut off the internet from the outside so it can be all clean, all the time.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I think there's a reasonable chance that the "content" he mentions is entirely in his imagination, conjured up by the URL, which he was too afraid to actually type into his browser.

<p>Maybe he's a member one of those religions that think suck is a 'bad' word. It is a fine day to wake up on the right side of the Atlantic where mannequins have perky nipples and suck is something a hoover does<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Didn't Sister Paul Mary tell you about the EVIL that AWAITS YOU for pleasuring yourself?! You're going to go BLIND and then your palm with GROW HAIR!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Books on Tape is doing a booming business in porn these days from what I've heard...must be all those blind catholics getting their fix. Hey, and if you like the perky nipples you should see the units on some of the guy mannequins! I'M TINGLING!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
