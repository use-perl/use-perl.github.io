<p>Dear Log,
<p>And so, last Tuesday, I went to see the <a href="http://www.mysticalartsoftibet.org/">monk-show</a>.
The Tibetan monks sort of did the polytonic ("multitonic") chanting, with the dissonant horns and cymbals.
There was an interlude of snow-tiger pantomime, basically like a two-person Chinese dragon outfit --
except that it's a snow tiger, so it gets to gambol around and do cat things instead
of dragon things: it can sort of nod off, wake up, run around, gnaw at fleas, nod off,
gnaw at fleas some more, and run around.  A crowdpleaser.
<p>Then more chanting; then two of the monks
danced around in very D&iacute;a de los Muertos outfits, the exact meaning of which
I don't remember, even thought it was carefully explained (as were each of the segments)
by the MC monk with a very Indian accent.  The dances were sort of like hula dancing
adapted to the Himalayas -- slow, ceremonial,
stylized, and 
representational in ways you wouldn't know about unless
it was explained to you.
<p>The oddest thing about the chanting, to me, wasn't the musical or vocal qualities of it, but the
phonetic properties of it: there seemed to be no /i/ or /e/ vowels in what they were chanting.
It made me suspect that they were actually <em>spelling</em> the lyrics instead of
straight reciting them to music.  It's an odd idea, but then, they were odd people.
<p>Then a segment of Tibetan <em>comedy gold!</em>  This consists of one monk sitting
down and asserting some philosophical proposition (all in Tibetan) -- in this case, I think
the assertion was (as later translated) that the impermanence of sound is somehow
similar to the role of terms in a syllogism.  Then the other monks heckle him, by
saying that his ideas are vague, unrevealing, uninteresting, counterfactual, or poorly
expressed.  These attacks also feature giggling,
a sort of "Hah! Take THAT!" clap-gesture, and taking off the asserter's big yellow
pompom-hat and handing it to him.  The asserter responds with clarifications, defenses,
and however you say "nu-unh!" in Tibetan.  All the monks on stage start joining in the fray
and then everyone collapses laughing, and that's the end of that segment.
<p>It was a kind of Hegelian dialectic that I never could have imagined;
altho in retrospect it seems to be a very logical development of a culture
that answers the question "when do we start bombing?" with "never"
instead of "whenever".
<p>Then wrapup with more chanting.  Applause, standing&nbsp;O, t-shirts and CDs
on sale in the lobby.

WTF, they're <a href="http://www.drepung.org/changing/mystical/Tour-Sch.htm" title="drepung.org">visiting </a drepung.org> Ketchikan but not Vancouver?<br> <br>Could they not get a license from la Regie des illuminations et pens&eacute;es orientales?

Yeah, it's pretty weird.  On the other hand, I think their visit here was paid for by a big grant from the state arts council or something; and as they were already on the way to Juneau, Ketchikan is a simple stopover.

<p>An aside: the venue was the local high school auditorium.  I went there expecting bomb-shelter architecture and bomb-shell acoustics too.  But it was actually a really decent auditorium, almost verging on being an authentic concert hall.  Recently built, comfortable, clean, etc.  I was quite surprised.</p><p>But then, a recurring form of sanity in Alaska seems to be: "OK, if there's going to be only one of these in this town, we're going to get it <em>right</em>".
</p><p>After having lived in LA and New Mexico, you can see that I am unprepared for such right-headedness.</p>
