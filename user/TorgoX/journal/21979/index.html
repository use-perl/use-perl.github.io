<p>Dear Log,

<p><blockquote>&laquo;The measure is the first of several provisions seeking to restrict
abortion rights, due before Congress in the New year.
<p>Among them is a bill that would prevent minors from travelling
outside their states to seek abortion counselling.
<p>And there is a measure that would require doctors to lecture patients
on the pain felt by the foetus during an abortion, although scientists
have not established whether a foetus does feel pain.
&raquo;

approves anti-abortion clause"</a></blockquote>

<em>Meanwhile...</em>

<p><blockquote>&laquo;Only about a third of Americans believe that Charles Darwin's theory of
evolution is a scientific theory that has been well supported by the
evidence, while just as many say that it is just one of many theories
and has not been supported by the evidence. The rest say they don't know
enough to say. Forty-five percent of Americans also believe that God
created human beings pretty much in their present form about 10,000
years ago. A third of Americans are biblical literalists who believe
that the Bible is the actual word of God and is to be taken literally,
word for word.&raquo;

I love 18th century rationalism.  And when it gets to the US, golly, what
fun it'll be!  I wonder if that'll be before, or after, we get "faith-based solutions"
to <a href="http://www.viridiandesign.org/">climate disasters</a>.

<p>I recall a moment in high school where a <a href="http://home.datawest.net/esn-recovery/artcls/socio.htm">stately Southern girl</a> explained to me quite calmingly that no-one need worry about the atmosphere trouble (which I was writing a paper on) because
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=REV%2B1&showfn=on&showxref=on&language=haitian&version=HCV">Jesuswocky</a>
had told her that it'll all be fixed real soon now, God-o-matically.

<p>And I've always wondered: does she wear a seatbelt?

<p>(Moral of the story: when you run code tests and it reports "FAIL", that is not a <em>moral</em> failure.  Yet.)</p>
