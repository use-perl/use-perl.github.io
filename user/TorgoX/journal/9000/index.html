<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;Why is it that famous men who spill their guts only become more "complex", more worth taking seriously, whereas a woman who tells the truth about herself becomes a bimbo? It's because society still sees advantages in keeping women shamed and silent, their secrets a soft spot that can be prodded at if they threaten to step out of line.&raquo;<p

I don't agree with the supposed cause there -- but then, causation is such a sticky concept in social systems.  I usually ascribe to dysfunctional momentum what others would ascribe to concerted social malice.

<p>Take Ozzy and Anna Nicole as an example...both are aging, brain damaged, lead desperately uninteresting lives and make idiots of themselves on 'reality TV'...but the content of the criticisms flung their way are quite different. My theory for this type of double standard is that, by and large, women seem to be more likely to watch these kinds of shows , bother caring about the personal details of celebrities and are far more harsh on their fellow women not following the protocol. In parts of the world where women are considered to be persecuted by religious regimes and male dominance it is the women who enforce the rigid social structure as much if not moreso than the men. Why anyone cares about the dirty laundry of celebrities is another issue entirely.</p>
