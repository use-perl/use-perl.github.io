<p>Dear Log,
<p>So I went to New Mexico for a week, for some R&amp;R.  But I got altitude sickness-- that was quite unexpected, because I lived in New Mexico for 1996-2002.

<p>But it happened: I spent three days looking white as a sheet, having an a head rush (occasionally becoming a headache), and being barely able to stay awake.  It wasn't as bad as if I had the flu or something, but it was close.

<p>I eventually got better, mostly, and so I spent the last few days eating and shopping.  I now can't even remember whatever my tasks were before the trip, so I'm tempted to consider the trip a success.  And I'm now merrily back in Alaska, livin' large at <a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-09-27_town/ship"
>sea level</a>.

<p>I'm still working my way thru the stack of books I got during the trip, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1896597890">this</a> was the best so far.  It's about North Korea, and shows that the place is even crazier than I thought -- and I thought it was <em>really</em> crazy already.  THEY ARE SO SCREWD LOL LOL</p>

But isn't Alaska further north than Mexico!?

Yes, but there's fewer trees in Mexico, so the air is thinner.
