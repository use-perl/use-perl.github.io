<p>Dear Log,
<p>Meanwhile, that <em>other</em> "greatest generation": <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/mickey05292004.html">the millions of Soviets</a> who died by the millions
but still managed to slice Hitler's army to ribbons.

Oops, commenting on the wrong entry.  Sean, you write too many entries too fast...<br>

I have to admit that
"This system will probably not appeal to kids. The games are just too simplistic." actually works as a commentary on the nationalistic hagiographies of WWII.

<p>Expecting to see some description or history of the Soviet's role in WWII, only the first two of the twenty-nine paragraphs even mention it.</p>

<p>What I don't understand is, <i>even if</i> the government - and by government, we must limit it to a relative handful of decision makers - had less-than-stellar motivations for the war and how it was conducted (at the macro level), and used propaganda to snooker the U.S. population into believing they were ridding the world of some great evil, how does that detract from what the majority of that generation did?</p>

What a worthless piece of internet-driven drivel.  Surely, you can do better.

Nope.  Try again.  Any article that starts its talking points with, "The U.S. fought that war against racism with a segregated army" smells a lot worse than feet.  It's nothing more than a childish, "I hate the US" rant.
<p>
Hint: WWII was not a war for or against racism.</p>
