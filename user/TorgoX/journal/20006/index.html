<p>Dear Log,
<p>Over on PBS, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript329_full.html">two chicken-fried goons</a> flail and <a href="http://www.jerkcity.com/jerkcity2119.html">spaz:</a>
<blockquote>&laquo;BILL MOYERS:  [...] Would you like me to lead a movement to write my biblical views into the Constitution? Would you like to live in that democracy?
<p>CAL THOMAS: Well, somebody's gotta live under somebody's value system.&raquo;</blockquote>

I call that the "everybody's gotta live in a Texas somewhere" argument.  (Variatians: Salem, Mississippi, Haiti, Zimbawbe, or any specially nasty Eurasian hellhole.  I like to switch it up!)
<p>And now what I call a Freudian slipped analogy:

<blockquote>&laquo;BILL MOYERS: But when you and I were in Washington in 1964, many states still prohibited interracial marriages.
<p>CAL THOMAS: Yes, well that's different.   Race and behavior are two different things. I've met many former homosexuals. I've never met a former African-American&raquo;</blockquote>

Yes indeedy, we all pity the black man for being <em>made</em> that way.

<p>In fact, as part of my impending reign of terror as Kommissar And Boss Of You,
I will require a Constitutional diktat that gay marriage must be legal
in those states, and only those states, where interracial marriages are
legal too, freeing the states to legalize or ban both, or neither, but not one or the other.  The resulting clamor would amuse me; at this point, I figure it's about time something about the country should amuse me, one way or another.

<p>Meanwhile, in the land of pixels and bandwidth:

<p><blockquote>&laquo;Recently, Atari released The Temple of Elemental Evil, a computer game based with nerdish precision on the actual dice-and-paper Dungeons & Dragons rules. It has the requisite elf magic and fighting orcsÃ¢â¬âbut it also has a gay wedding, as Matthew D. Barton described in his (rather stunned) online review of the game.&raquo;
<p>--<a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2098406/">"The Game of Wife: Gay marriage comes to video games."</a></blockquote>

Let's marry six George W. Bush / Goth Snoopy avatars in VRML!!!  Although that raises an important "theological" (Jesus) question: are there Activist Judges in cyberspace?  What would <a href="http://interglacial.com/rss/capalert_movies.rss">CAPalert say?</a>
