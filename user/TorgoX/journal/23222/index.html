<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;Most adults in the village of Sultan Pur More, northern Punjab, have donated a kidney. 
<br>[...]
<br>It is one of dozens of villages that provide the human stock for Pakistan's burgeoning cash-for-kidneys trade.
<br>[...]
<br>The organ sales business, outlawed in all but a handful of countries, is
legal and booming in Pakistan. The gold standard is the kidney.
Frustrated by years-long waiting lists at home and fearful of an early
death, "transplant tourists" from Europe, the US and the Middle East are
flocking to private Pakistani hospitals for operations which can be
arranged in days at a fraction of the cost back home.
<br>[...]
<br>"We have no law governing transplants, so everyone just makes their own.
That suits the rich, but the poor are coerced - by the feudal-type
societies they live in, or their own poverty - into selling their
kidney. It's just wrong. Where will it stop? With eye, lung or heart
transplants?"
<br>[...]
<br>"The scar didn't heal well, and I feel tired easily so I can't do
hard work now. But I was tired of all those people coming looking for
money," he said. "What else was I going to do?"&raquo;<blockquote>--<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/pakistan/Story/0,2763,1409415,00.html">"Transplant
tourists flock to Pakistan, where poverty and lack of regulation fuel trade in human
organs"</a></blockquote></blockquote>

I don't need anything as low-rent as a
<a href="http://www.thescarymonkeyshow.com/features/trans/dh.htm">kidney
transplant</a>, from any Pakistani or anything.

<p>No, I'm <em>special</em> and I need to go over to India, to get a
<a href="http://www.sacredcenters.com/chakras.html">chakra</a> transplant.
My aura is all speckly and keeps phasing, and my Brane Chakra is on the fritz so I
can't concentrate on coding well enough to finish Pod::Parser or deal with the neat
patches to HTML::Tree that the Chicago.pm folks sent me.
<p>Therefore I will buy six
or seven extra chakras from some Indian peasants and have them transplanted out
at a low low price.  Sure, afterward, the "donors" will be bruised and wailing
zombies, but I need a pick-me-up!!  Ownership society!!!!</p>
