<p>Dear Log,
<p>I watch Colin Quinn's show on Comedy Central for the same reason I watched Anna Nicole's show:
because I can't <em>not</em> watch. It's like driving a traffic accident -- you have to look.
And, at times, all those ethnical people from the East Coast are fun to mock.

<p>But the other day was a new low for Colin, that Typhoid Mary of comedy: He was talking, and the audience started laughing.  This so puzzled and angered him that he yelled: "WHAT'S SO FUNNY!?".
<p>Well.  Hm.
<p>Okay, let's just shorthand it:  If you're a comedian, on a comedy show, on Comedy Central, and people laugh at things you say (however unexpectedly!) and this makes you <em>angry</em>, then something is quite wrong.  You are, shall we say, "mis-cast".</p>

To be honest I've never been able to watch an entire Colin Quinn show.  I've tried on a number of occasions.  I just end up annoyed instead of amused.   There's something about him that just gets my goat<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>At least we can thank Comedy Central for The Daily Show.  I'll take Jon Stewart over Colin Quinn any day of the week.

Colin just isn't good there.  The show has potential, and some of the recurring guests are excellent (despite them being, in the times I've watched, imbalanced toward the right<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but then again, how many lefties do you know that like telling racist jokes?).  But just like TDS didn't really take off until Jon Stewart took over from whatshisname, Tough Crowd may need Quinn to become a whatshisname.<br> <br>It's a bit sad, because he SEEMS like he would be good on that show.  But he just isn't.
