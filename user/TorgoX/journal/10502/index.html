<p>Dear Log,
<blockquote>&laquo;This kind of <a
href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/nato/story/0,12667,892727,00.
html">bickering between the powerful</a> has little interest to
<a href="http://www.who.int/inf-fs/en/back001.html">most</a>
<a href="http://www.youandaids.org/AsiaPacific/China/Index.asp">of</a>
<a href="http://www.who.int/ctd/schisto/index.html">humanity</a>.

The difference between Europe and the US is significant and
has been accentuated in recent months, but to the vast majority of the
developing world American domination represents a development in the
narrative of European empire, not a break from it.

<p>At times it can even appear like an improvement. Even as
anti-American sentiment is growing in France, there have been
anti-French demonstrations in the former French colony of the Ivory
Coast, where a peace deal brokered by France has been greeted with
opposition. Last week, as the French expressed their scepticism at
secretary of state Colin Powell's presentation to the security council,
protesters in the capital, Abidjan, waved American flags and placards
saying: <a
href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/france/story/0,11882,892380,00.
html">"Bush please help Ivory Coast against French terrorism."</a> The
fact that America backed the very deal they were demonstrating against
shows how great is the confusion and how little there is to choose
between the two powers.&raquo;<p
>--<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/women/story/0,3604,821139,00.html">"Twin vision of
empire"</a>: The differences between Europe and the US are exaggerated. To the rest
of the world, they look much the same</blockquote>
