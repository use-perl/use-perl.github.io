<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;One benefit of disclosure might be to dissuade universities from using double standards so blatant -- whether for legacies, athletes, or racial minorities -- as to offend voters. A second benefit might be to focus attention on the real crisis in minority education: The average black 17-year-old is academically less prepared for college than the average white or Asian 8th-grader. A third benefit might be to shame elite universities into seeking more needy and working-class students, who are far more underrepresented than blacks and Hispanics. Such "economic preferences" are widely popular because -- if carefully designed -- they are consistent with traditional concepts of merit. The hope is that the hard work and raw talent of the best of these needy students will enable them to catch up with college classmates from more-prosperous backgrounds and better high schools.&raquo;

<p>When I establish Torgo Imperial University (probably on the smoking ruins of something-or-other or someone-or-other), I will take a hint from Zim and admit slave/students based on one criterion: absorbency.</p>

<h2>Economics</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2004-02-11T04:36:30</h3>
I have long favored economic quotas over racial quotas, for obvious reasons: Tiger Woods certainly didn't need any extra help, but my white friend from South Central L.A. sure could have used additional help.  Giving Tiger preference over D-Tox just because Tiger is "black" is ridiculous.  Similarly, rejecting help to inner city blacks just because you don't like racial preferences is ridiculous, too.<br> <br>Unfortunately, just when it seemed like economic quotas were taking root, you get schools deciding to give preference to blacks because it helps with some completely ambiguous notion of "diversity."  Two parts white people, one part black people, one part Hispanic people, one part Asian people<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... now that's a recipe for learnin'!<br> <br>Because, after all, all black people are the same, and you can just substitute one for another and get the same result<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... right?  Same with whiteys.  TorgoX, Pudge, jjohn, we're all essentially the same person, because, well, we're white.<br> <br>All I can say is: long live Dave Chappelle.  "Hey man, how do YOU know that song?"  "I grew up in the suburbs, I can't help it!"<br> <br>I do like Kennedy's transparency idea.  Uh-oh, I am agreeing with a Kennedy.  Maybe you are on to something with this absorbency thing.<br>
