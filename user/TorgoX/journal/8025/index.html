<p>I spent all day working on Pod::Simple::RTF.  I think the basic Pod::Simple framework is now quite mature; I only made two or three minute changes to it in the whole course of writing Pod::Simple::RTF.
<p>Most of today's fiddling with the RTF thing was adding heuristics that almost no-one will notice, but which make things pretty -- things like "codeblocks of under 15 lines shouldn't be split across pages", and "A reasonably short heading followed by a paragraph shouldn't be split across pages".  These aren't exactly trivial things with a tokeparser interface, but I pull 80/20 cheats here and there -- so under some very rare cases, a "keep this together with the next paragraph" code won't get generated.  But no big deal; it's just hardcopies of docs.
<p>Benefits of a tokeparser framework: it's fast!  It parses AND formats perlvar in under a second.
And that's even as it has to go construct and destroy a few thousand objects along the way.  (A point where I diverge from HTML::TokeParser's approach is that I have tokens be actual objects, with accessors, not just bare arrayrefs.)

<p>I also spent forever figuring out how to express Unicode characters in RTF -- horror itself, and shoddily supported even in MSWord 2000, but it's better than just doing s/[^\x00-\xff]/X/g;.  I've got to at least try, since there's not much of an alternative.

<p>I rather wish RTF allowed comments.  I.e., things that a RTF processor (or rather, <em>the</em> RTF processor, since using anything but MSWord to interpret RTF can be pretty dicey) would discard, but which could be used for the equivalent of "&lt;!-- and now we start the thing that might not work -->" or whatever.  It'd just be handy for debugging.

<p>Anyhow, the RTF thing is almost done (I've only got left the bit that automatically marks things that look like code as being not spellcheckable), at which point I won't have to think about RTF in any real detail for quite a while.
<p>By the way,
s/([^\x00-\xFF])/'\\uc1\\u'.( (ord($1) &lt; 32768) ? ord($1):(ord($1)-65536) ).'?'/eg;<br>That's what turns Unicode characters like "\x{4E4B}\x{9053}" into their RTF representation, &laquo;\uc1\u20043?\uc1\u-28589?&raquo;.  Whee!
<p>In other news,
I'm coming to the slow and grudging realization

Right?

Well, once this RTF thing is done, then I think
I should finish the Pod::Simple documentation,
then see about a Pod::Simple::Man.  I don't really know *roff, but I'll see how far I get by just retrofitting the current Pod::Man.

<h2>Your book</h2>

Is bloody good.  It's one of those books that changes the way people work.  After editing it, I was a lot more comfortable with using the web as a data source (and sometimes as a data sink).  I couldn't have put together OSCON without it.<p>

<h2>HTML::TokeParser::Simple</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2002-09-26T22:23:42</h3>
<blockquote><div> <em>(A point where I diverge from HTML::TokeParser's approach is that I have tokens be actual objects, with accessors, not just bare arrayrefs.)</em> </div></blockquote>

<p>Never having been a fan of HTML::TokeParser's arrayrefs, I wrote <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/OVID/HTML-TokeParser-Simple-1.3/" title="cpan.org">HTML::TokeParser::Simple</a cpan.org>.  It provides the accessor methods I wanted and makes the code much easier to read.  Want to know if a token is a starting or ending form tag?  With HTML::TokeParser, you do this:</p>

<p> <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if( ('S' eq $token-&gt;[0] or 'E' eq $token-&gt;[0]) and 'form' eq $token-&gt;[1] ) {</tt> </p>

<p>Now, you can do this:</p>

<p> <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ( $token-&gt;is_tag( 'form' ) ) {</tt> </p>

<p>Heck, you can leave the 'form' off to get a boolean response on whether or not something is a tag.  There are many useful methods, it makes HTML parsing an almost trivial affair, and I have no idea if anyone is using the darn thing.  That's a somewhat deflating aspect of being a CPAN author.  Aside from the occasional bug report, who knows if you've helped anyone?  I've had some thoughts of other things I'd like to do with that module, but I don't want to spend a lot of time one something that no one will ever use.</p>
