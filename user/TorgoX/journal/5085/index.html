<p>Dear Log,<p>Guess what open source <i>personnage</i> is being <a href="http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0205.1/0459.html">talked about about here</a>:
<blockquote>Perhaps that will be a lesson to the self-styled "Hacker of social systems" that there is a reason he has two ears and only one mouth. 
<p>As a low-level hacker he needed to elicit support from others to get his work recognised and included. He was unwilling to listen to advice and criticism from those who know a lot better than him, and his work was not of such obvious brilliance that people were prepared to accept it without change. 
<p>He was not prepared to make the changes folks wanted, so he took his ball and went away in a strop.</blockquote>

<h2>Well, until the sex tips</h2>

<p>I was going to say any number of geeks around open source but the 2nd hint gave it away; ESR. Do I get a prize?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) You should have added the hint  "Did he grope your girlfriend at the OSCon"?  or "Who made a disgraceful press release after 9/11 offering the argument that more guns on planes would have prevented the violence." The sex tips links is just too cruel<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>



<h2>Kernel Traffic</h2>

<p>My habit of reading the kernel traffic summaries paid off.  I recognized the quote immediately.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
