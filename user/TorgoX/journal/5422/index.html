<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;The report cites three reasons why so much waste is exported from the US:
labour costs in Asia are very low, environmental and occupational codes are
poorly enforced, and US law does not impose any controls on such exports. 

<p>The US is the only industrialised country to have failed to ratify the 1989 UN
Basel convention which calls for a total ban on the export of hazardous waste.&raquo;<p
>--<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,725756,00.html">"China bans toxic American computer junk"</a></blockquote>
I had a weird idea that China was a communist country, and that therefore it had a planned economy; and <em>therefore</em> that one couldn't just discover that oops, there's vast numbers of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4385995,00.html">unemployed</a>, or that people rooting around in imported toxic gack.  But I guess China is just "communist" in about the same way that the US is "Christian".</p>

<p>Of course, that's why the US can have normal relations with China, while we have to stay clear of the evil Cubans. The embargo of Cuba has only been going on for three decades after all -- I'm sure they'll see the light and give up on Fidel any day now. We've got to give these policies a chance.</p>

&gt; I'm sure they'll see the light and give up on Fidel any day now<br> <br>Highly unlikely as long as the US companies whose property  in Cuba was nationalized won't be getting it back.  Say, Bacardi.<br>

Oh, I didn't mean that the Americans would give up on the embargo.  I meant (sarcastically) that the Cubans would give up on having Fidel as a leader.  Some people might think that the fact that the embargo hasn't worked in 32 years suggests it won't work in 32+epsilon, but what do they know?
