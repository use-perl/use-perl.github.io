<p>Dear Log,

<p>Me and some friends chatting about a serious condition to which you might know the cure:

<p><b>Torgo X:</b> <i>[I describe a painful interaction with someone who makes a point of stating the obvious and waiting for people to recognize his <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0119217">brilliance</a>.]</i>
<p><b>Slappy Morocco:</b> "It's the MIT syndrome."
<p><b>Torgo X:</b> "What's 'MIT Syndrome'?"
<p><b>Slappy Morocco:</b> "Well, unfortunately, most smart people grow up thinking (correctly) that they're the smartest person around.  So they tend to second-guess everyone around them.  This becomes a problem when they start interacting with other smart kids.  E.g., freshman year, MIT."
<p><b>Cloneborg:</b> "Yeah, and then they go to <a href="http://www.timecube.com/">MIT,</a> and are still as smart, but aren't the smartEST.  But they're quite used to the idea that whenever they open their mouth, it's something which no-one else has ever thought of before."
<p><b>Torgo X:</b> "...and which will impress their professor and get them a gold star!"
<p><b>Slappy Morocco:</b> "And that's the MIT Syndrome!"

<p><b>Cloneborg:</b> "The arrogance of the average MIT student is boggling. It's like getting
accepted to MIT was the achievement of a lifetime and everyone else should
<em>learn to understand that</em>."

<p><br><br>The question is, what is the cure?  Suggestions
so far have included:  pantsing, and jumper cables.

<p>I was accepted to MIT but decided not to go as that must have been the year with the highest number of suicides in MIT history. Besides, it takes a smart person to know just how stupid and insignificant they really are...which doesn't describe about 99% of MIT grads. I think the class 'How to be an arrogant fucknut' is a 100 through 400 level core requirement in conjunction with 'If you tell people repeatedly and loudly enough just how brilliant you are they will eventually believe you'.</p>

MIT's idea of comparative religions class is "Why We Are Superior To Normals."

<p>Perhaps a delicious send-up would help reduce the egos of those haughty scamps!

That <a href="http://www.goldmanart.com/exhibitions/stereotypical" title="goldmanart.com"> site</a goldmanart.com> is actually really interesting. The juxtaposition of personal items with personalities and answers is neat.
