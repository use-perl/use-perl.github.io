<div class="span8">
<p>Dear Log,
<p>When I worked at KAOS, we had a quirky employee named Bah.  Subhenchwoman Bah was a strange sort.  She always talked at the comfortable conversational tone of 90 decibels, like a bus engine with no oil in it.  And speaking of oil, some oddity of endocrinology made her exude a strange grease from her human-like skin.  Because of it, the mere thought of touching her workstation's track-ball or telephone was enough to make you squirm.

<p>And no-one would go near Subhenchwoman Bah's work alcove because it was a rat's nest of sebaceous post-its, scribbled on in a script like something out of Lovecraft, and smeared. "10am 2/3 F'thnangkk upload", etc.

<p>One time, me and Minion Rupa had to talk to Bah about some project she was working on.  And whatever it was, at some point, I said "Hm, it'd probably be faster if you just restore it from an old  backup I have somewhere."  "Somewhere?"  "Well, I have five or six backup CDROMs, each with tens of thousands of data files on them with no particular organization."

<p>Subhenchwoman Bah seized on this, sensing some sort of vindication in her struggle against Minion Rupa's repeated criticism of Bah's messy alcove.  She yipped at me: "Ah!!! AAAAAAH!  SEEEEE, you have JUST as much clutter as I DOOOOOOOOO!"

<p>I said quickly, "Yes, but my clutter isn't made of <em>atoms."</em>

<p>At this, Minion Rupa broke into hysterical laughter.  Bah was zinged.  I just wanted a donut.
<p>I'm glad I quit that whole freaky-deaky scene.
<p>One day I will have that donut.
</p>
