<p>Dear Log,

<p>My friend David went to grad school and was thus subjected to courses from "quantitative political scientists".  These are people who dream up equations where you feed in a country's GNP and population density and literacy rate and annual per capita hair-pin consumption, and you get something predicting how many years will pass before that country declares war on Argentina, or whatever.  It's all <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684824299">terribly scientific</a>.

<p>The only real value of this lost year of David's was (besides adding the letters "M.A." after his name) that it afforded a <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=1320933653">dazzling peek</a> into the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0631205101">subconscious</a>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553293354">motivations</a>
of people in the "sciences".
<br>But incidentally: while staggering thru required reading, he read an article that posited some explanation within a quantitativist ("quantoid") framework, developed it, showed that it worked, and then -- quite to the dismay of his professors -- ended by basically saying: it's all for naught, because you can't quantify power -- oh, maybe you can imagine you can, but you can't measure it, so fat lot of good it does you to quantify it.  And so [it continued] maybe all these formalist models that we so love to spin using more and abstruse math that only by coincidence ever describes the real world, is just a bunch of fudge factors knit together with Greek letters and integral signs, all of it amounting to nothing more than "NARCISSISTIC PSEUDO-INNOVATION".

<p>And when he told me about this article, and that wonderful turn of phrase at the end, I was struck dumb.  And every time now that I see something <a href="http://roa.rutgers.edu/files/quicklist.html">very formalistic that contorts and elaborates</a>, I wonder: <a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/ivpress/title/exc/1287.html">is this trip really necesary?</a>  Does this "formalism" get you anything you couldn't just say more easily in <a href="http://www.k-1.com/Orwell/pol.htm">plain English</a>?  The <a href="http://magnonel.guild.net/user/schwern/papers/Why_I_Am_Not_A_Java_Programmer/why.html">hassles</a> you go thru to get your framework to fit your data (or vice versa!), is it worth it?  Or is it all just <em>narcissistic pseudo-innovation?</em>

<p>I found this gem in the introduction to a book on classical mechanics, which the author used to slate the enemies of science, the traditional (religion, the inquisition) and the modern (social science): <i>That one never has to vary G or introduce any fudge factors in order to fit

emperical data illustrates the essential difference between the mere

mathematical modelling of irregular phenonema and laws of nature: research

fields that are totally disconnected from physics have no universal constants.</i> </p>

Funny that you mention G specifically -- me and David's private term for the quantoids is "the 'gamma-causes-war' people".
