<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;This trend of the dominance of the A and the diminution of the C began in the
1960s, abated somewhat in the '70s and came back strong in the '80s. The
previous signs of academic disaster, D and F, went by the wayside in the
Vietnam era, when flunking out meant becoming eligible for the draft. At Duke,
Pomona, Harvard and elsewhere, D's and F's combined now represent about 2
percent of all grades given.&raquo;<p

<h2>Grade inflation</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2003-06-10T17:48:54</h3>
It's not just the number of A's that's increasing at the expense of C's, D's and F's.  Coursework is generally getting easier as well.
<p>
It's been a <i>long</i> time since I was in an academic environment, but when I was taking Calculus in high school, we could see how the AP tests got progressively easier year-by-year.  Each exam we had for about two years had an essay question from the AP tests, starting with recent ones and progressively getting older.  By the end of senior year, we started taking old AP essay exams for practice.
</p><p>
We spent so much time preparing that the questions given within the previous few years were not that difficult.  The questions from ten to fifteen years earlier were too difficult for us to even attempt.  That was a very sobering realization.</p>

Last spring I went to my daughters high school graduation. A number of the scholarly students in addition to the usual accolades; it was pointed out had also attained G.P.A's in the 4.4-4.6 range. This, of course, being based on the grading scale of 0.0 to 4.0<br/><br/>   2 + 2 = 5 for sufficiently large
   values of 2.<br/><br/>Pismobird
