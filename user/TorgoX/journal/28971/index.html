<p><p>Dear Log,

>&laquo;'The police even visited my home,' he says. 'And they told me they
were ready to do what they did in 1985, when hundreds of gays and
lesbians were rounded up and interrogated by the Communist
police.'&nbsp; Law and Justice (PiS) came to power promising to purge
the EU's largest new member of corruption, cronyism and disparities of
wealth that have sent the Warsaw skyline soaring, while the elderly
struggle and unemployment nears 20 per cent.

<br><br>[...]Human Rights Watch has accused President Lech Kaczynski of presiding over 'official homophobia' in Poland - as mayor of Warsaw he banned gay parades and said he was 'not willing to meet perverts' when asked to talk to its organisers.
<br><br>His twin brother, Jaroslaw, the leader of PiS, has said gay people should not teach in schools, while Prime Minister Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz has called homosexuality an 'unnatural' thing that the state must prevent from 'infecting' the general public.

It's so nice to see the EU securing for itself a resentful benighted
peasantry!  Just so long as the rabble there doesn't get voting privileges and the presidency of the EU... oh&nbsp;wait... uhoh...
<br><br>And to think that the big worry about Poland is that it would be a source of <a href=
