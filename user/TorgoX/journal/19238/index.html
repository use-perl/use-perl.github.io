<p>Dear Log,
<p>Now playing: the Texas Taliban Experience, starring President Napoleonjesus (f/ Pope Jizzlepizzle&#178;)!

<p><blockquote>&laquo;On his recent trip to Rome, President Bush asked a top Vatican official
to push American bishops to speak out more about political issues,
including same-sex marriage, according to a report in the National
Catholic Reporter, an independent newspaper.
<p>In a column posted Friday evening on the paper's Web site, John L. Allen
Jr., its correspondent in Rome and the dean of Vatican journalists,
wrote that Mr. Bush had made the request in a June 4 meeting with
Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican secretary of state. Citing an
unnamed Vatican official, Mr. Allen wrote: "Bush said, 'Not all the
American bishops are with me' on the cultural issues. The implication
was that he hoped the Vatican would nudge them toward more explicit
activism."&raquo;
<p>--<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/13/politics/13george.html">"Bush Asked for Vatican's Help on Political Issues, Report Says"</a></blockquote>
Can we tax the churches yet, can we, huh can we?

"Sure, we'll help you out with abortion. Of course, we'll also encourage our bishops to speak out against the war, against the death penalty..."

Against the death penalty? I didn't know they were against that. Learn something new everyday.

<h2>I wouldn't worry too much</h2>

it's not like the Catholics in the US have listened to the Pope in a long while. Asking for the Pope's help....ah, well, it wouldn't be the first time....remember Pope Pius of Hitler.
