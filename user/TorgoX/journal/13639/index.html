<p>Dear Log,<p>From March:
<blockquote>&laquo;"Power," the moral realist John Adams warned the
idealist Thomas Jefferson, in words he could have addressed to George W.
Bush, "<a href="http://www.thinkexist.com/English/Author/x/Author_4513_1.htm"
>always thinks it has a great soul and vast views beyond the
comprehension of the weak</a>; and that it is doing God's service when it is
violating all His laws. Our passions ... possess so much metaphysical
subtlety and so much overpowering eloquence that they insinuate
themselves into the understanding and the conscience and convert both to
their party." Abraham Lincoln, who called Americans the almost chosen
people, also speaks to the hubristic illusion of power when he reminds
us, "The Almighty has his own purposes."&raquo;<p >--<a
href="http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/polipro/pp2003-03-05.htm">"In
the Name of God":</a> Bush's rhetoric suggests that he feels God has
chosen him to lead the U.S. against "Evil." Is that why Bush is dragging
us into an unprovoked war?</blockquote>

<p>The Hussein regime was evil in any sense of the word you want to apply. If you were living there I am sure you would have rejoiced knowing that your daughter was abducted, beaten in the head with a hammer until she died, dismembered and deposited on your doorstep. This is just ONE of thousands of "incidents" Hussein and his wacked followers committed. WMD? Who cares, he needed to go. If not the U.S., then who?</p>

<p>Should we have just let him continue?</p>

Well, I was actually interested in the Adams quote, but hey, any excuse to bring up skull-pummelings is fine by me!

Sure, man. We pay good money to treat people that way worldwide! Waste not, want not.

Hussein's rise to power was funded by people attempting to install a lesser evil.  Look at the result.
<p>
While it may be better to do <em>something</em> rather than nothing, keep in mind that you bear responsibility if it goes wrong, and it almost always does.  Whoever we shove into the power vacuum this time will probably, after a while in there, start to suck too.</p>

In related news, coinvicted criminal Ahmed Chalabi was installed by the United States as Iraq's president today.<br> <br>OK, he was convicted in absentia by Jordan for mostly unsubstantiated claims pushed by Saddam Hussein, which Jordan went along with for the sake of improved relations, and the U.S. didn't really install him, though it did back him, and he is one of nine total people who now compose the Presidency.  But still!
