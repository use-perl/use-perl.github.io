<p><b>Balloonenstein:</b> that's funny.

<p><b>Torgo X:</b> Speaking of which, it took me until last night to
work out for myself out that now that there's lots of cheap digital cameras going around

reluctant to get their <a

<p><b>Balloonenstein:</b> we should start an amateur porn site and then
practice relaxing on the beach with expensive drinks.

That's the finest use of Flash I have yet seen. Thanks, Torgox.
<br>
<br>Oh wait, this isn't going to show up on the Internet, is it?

It's a question of product rarity, hfb. When you can ride on the Green Line on a Friday or Saturday night and have a good chance at seeing some BC drunkard drop trou for merely a T-token, it's very difficult to make people <i>pay</i> for a flash picture show of the same thing. But, it is said that a good saleman can sell ice to eskimos.

I figured that out the minute we bought out digital camera.  It's not top-of-the-line, but it does fairly well --
