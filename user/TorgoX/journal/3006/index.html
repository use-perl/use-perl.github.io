<p>Dear Log,

<p>I added the following intro and quote to <a href="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?Babbage,+Charles">the FOLDOC entry on Babbage.</a>  In it, there is a moral: GET IT DONE.

<p>&laquo;Babbage, as (necessarily) the first person to work with machines that can attack problems at
arbitrary levels of abstraction, fell into a trap familiar to toolsmiths since, as described here
by the English ethicist, Lord Moulton: 

<p>"One of the sad memories of my life is a visit to the celebrated mathematician and inventor,
Mr Babbage. He was far advanced in age, but his mind was still as vigorous as ever. He took
me through his work-rooms. In the first room I saw parts of the original Calculating
Machine, which had been shown in an incomplete state many years before and had even been
put to some use. I asked him about its present form. 'I have not finished it because in
working at it I came on the idea of my Analytical Machine, which would do all that it was
capable of doing and much more. Indeed, the idea was so much simpler that it would have
taken more work to complete the Calculating Machine than to design and construct the other
in its entirety, so I turned my attention to the Analytical Machine.'" 

<p>"After a few minutes' talk, we went into the next work-room, where he showed and
explained to me the working of the elements of the Analytical Machine. I asked if I could see
it. 'I have never completed it,' he said, 'because I hit upon an idea of doing the same thing by
a different and far more effective method, and this rendered it useless to proceed on the old
lines.' Then we went into the third room. There lay scattered bits of mechanism, but I saw no
trace of any working machine. Very cautiously I approached the subject, and received the
dreaded answer, 'It is not constructed yet, but I am working on it, and it will take less time to
construct it altogether than it would have token to complete the Analytical Machine from the
stage in which I left it.' I took leave of the old man with a heavy heart." 

<p>"When he died a few years later, not only had he constructed no machine, but the verdict of a
jury of kind and sympathetic scientific men who were deputed to pronounce upon what he
had left behind him, either in papers or in mechanism, was that everything was too
incomplete of be capable of being put to any useful purpose." 

<p>[Lord Moulton, "The invention of algorithms, its genesis, and growth", in G. C. Knott, ed.,
"Napier tercentenary memorial volume" (London, 1915), p. 1-24; quoted in Charles
Babbage "Passage from the Life of a Philosopher", Martin Campbell-Kelly, ed. (Rutgers U.
Press and IEEE Press, 1994), p. 34]. &raquo;
