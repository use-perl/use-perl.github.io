<p>Dear Log,
<blockquote>&laquo;Some people write emails all in lower case with no punctuation. This
is intended to give the impression that they're incredibly busy, but in
fact makes people think they're the sort of person who drools when
they talk.&raquo;<p

If they use short lines then some people might think they are the soul of a  <i>vers libre</i> poet trapped in the body of a cockroach.

Does that mean I secretly want people to drool when they refer to me in writing?  Sounds pretty deep-seated...

I think you and <tt>brian d foy</tt> should get together and write Text::Filter::Cummings.

Did I actually write that?  I mean, of course, Text::Filter::cummings.

...cute article<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:)</tt> <br> <br>It got me thinking of my own pet peeves in the email department. Number one on my list is attachments of word documents which contain only text... which could have been placed in the body of the message.<br> <br>I get a handfull of these every week where I work. It bugs me.<br> <br>The only thing worse is that a few weeks back I received an email with an attached word document, a single sentance of content in the body of the email message, followed by this sentance of non-content in the body:<br> <br>&gt; Ingore the attached Word document.<br> <br>WTF!?<br> <br>-matt

Along similar lines, it really raises my hackles when there's 4-5 mails to the local Linux users' group list that are one or two lines with Jepoardy quoted contents of all of the previous messages.

Everyone I work with seems to do the same. It's sickening. Worse is that the 'standard' email client (Lotus Notes) also re-sends all the attachments each time. What a waste of bandwidth, storage, and backup time/space!<br> <br>Making matters worse is that folks don't get the point of shared volumes. Instead of putting a 10MB Access database on "the public drive", they'll email it to three folks, then engage in a conversation via email with 10MB attachments being duplicated for each recipient each time someone sends a message.<br> <br>The "quote the whole thread" syndrome is bad enough without mulitplying attachments into gigabytes of storage on the mail server (and backup tapes).<br> <br>Sigh...<br> <br>-matt<br>

Almost as bad as plaintext in word - people taking a screenshot (via the Alt-PrtScrn or whatever that it), pasting it into a Word document and emailing THAT. Augh!

...especially when the screenshot was something they could have copy pasted. This happened to me last week with a CGI script error message. Guess they didn't know their browser would let them copy text, and they didn't know they could type it directly, and they didn't know they could attach the screenshot directly instead of embedding it in Word.<br> <br>Sure is fun to bitch sometimes<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:)</tt> <br> <br>Getting off the subject of email, I once had someone send me some copy for a web page in a word document (which is perfectly acceptable in a work environment where everyone should have word since the content is formated and might not travel quite so well as plain text). Then when she made changes, she didn't send me the revised word document, or a short list of the changes.<br> <br>No, she printed the document out, and <em>faxed</em> it to me. This was copy that I needed to work with (put in HTML... basically copy/paste and trivial tweaks). The fax wasn't very helpfull.<br> <br>It reminded me of an old ITT Technical Institute commercial. This is a trade school for computer-type stuff. They had a comercial where a guy walks into an interview and the potential employer asks...<br> <br>&gt; Have you ever worked with anything<br>&gt; (...small pause for dramatic emphasis...)<br>&gt; <em>high-tech</em>?<br> <br>The interviewee looks all bewildered. Apparently he hadn't worked with anything "high-tech" (whatever that's supposed to mean) and needs to go to ITT Tech so he can do better in job interviews.<br> <br>I picture this woman who sent me the fax in a similar interview responding:<br> <br>&gt; <strong>Yes!</strong> I faxed a <em>web</em> page!<br> <br>-matt<br>
