<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;Sen. Barbara Boxer <em>[to a minion of Comm. Abernathy]</em>: I, however, am very frosted by
something that Commissioner Abernathy has sort of hung her
hat on in making this decision. And that's the fact versus fear
theory which I have now read. Today you used the word
alarmist cries. Just because you sit behind the microphone does
not make you smarter than other people, and to dismiss their
points of view by saying they're fearful, is an insult to them.&raquo;<p

<h2>I heard that</h2>

I was listening to the news and heard Boxer say that, and while I am not going to defend Abernathy's views, what she said about how the people who have problems with her views are ignorant or alarmist and whatnot<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... Boxer does that sort of thing *all the time.*  I was in CA when she was first elected, and her capacity to be dismissive of people who disagreed with her was striking then, and it continues today.<br> <br>I wanted Abernathy to say "you do the same thing!" and have Boxer reply <a href="http://www.neveh.org/price/priceavos.html" title="neveh.org">"but I am a great woman!,"</a neveh.org> but I suppose that is asking too much.
