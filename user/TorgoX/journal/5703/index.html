<p>Dear Log,
<blockquote>&laquo;A clean-up by the Komiteh, or morals police, has ensured that Barbie is no more. In a crackdown on "spiritual pollutants", shopkeepers have had their stocks seized. Peddlers selling Barbie-embossed products have been heavily penalised, and many businessmen in the Grand Bazaar have reportedly been arrested for importing the dolls or making the merchandise.&raquo;<p

&lt;barbie&gt;Fundamentalism is hard&lt;/barbie&gt; - is what it should have said, the tags vanished for some reason, perhaps the Komiteh had them!

<p>countless numbers of fucked up women over body image and implausible measurements might be avoided. People keep smugly pointing fingers at the Islamic part of the world claiming that the US treats women <i>so</i> much better and, really, I don't know that it's true. </p>

<p>Ditto.  I've got sisters.  This is an issue in a way a lot of men don't really understand.</p>

I bet nobody would be wistfully pining for thought police if this were a fundamentalist Christian group banning Barbie.<br> <p>I guess it's now hip to find something admirable in Muslim intolerance...  An ironic backlash if ever I saw one.</p>

<p>Oh, I don't really want additional government control.  Sometimes I just lament unfortunate situations.  Nevertheless, if I ever have kids, I may be the Barbie police in my own household.  (There's a huge difference in government control and parental control.)</p>
