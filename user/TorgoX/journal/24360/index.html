<p>Dear Log,

<p><blockquote>&laquo;The new core [=Antarctic ice sample] could be
enough to discredit the fast diminishing band of climate sceptics, who
have the ear of the Bush administration and who say that the climate
has always fluctuated and man's destruction of forests and use of oil
has nothing to do with the current rising temperatures and increased
storminess across the world.&raquo;
	<blockquote>--<a
	href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,1468499,00.html">"900,000-year-old
ice may destroy US case on Kyoto"</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>No amount of actual data could convince President Biff,
or his throngs of collaborators, to actually
tend to something as un-sexy as energy conservation.  The data from
the icecores will be denied.  "More research" will be needed.  Forever.
Because "war on greenhouse gasses" doesn't have the narcissistic appeal
of "war on terror".

<blockquote>&laquo;Given that fascism is among other things a carnival
of unreason, it would be odd to expect from it a coherent theoretical
case. As Paxton recognises, its approach to ideas is shamelessly
pragmatist: truth is whatever works to inspire the Volk and unite the
nation.&raquo;
	<blockquote>--<a
	href="http://thereitis.org/displayarticle195.html">review of
	Robert O. Paxton's <cite>The Anatomy of
	Fascism</a></cite></blockquote></blockquote>

The Party's tactical trinity on difficult subjects is, as always:
deny, downplay, and delay.  After all, it worked for keepin' down the
negroes!  Besides being a very histrionic approach, it's a very corporate one too -- 
as should please everyone
who'd ever hoped that Bush-2 would "run the government like a
business".

<p>To paraphrase <a
href="http://www.mnftiu.cc/mnftiu.cc/adventures_12.html">Saint
Augustine</a>: Lord, give me environmentalism -- but <em>not now.</em>
