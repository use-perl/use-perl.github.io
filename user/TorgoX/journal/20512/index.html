<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;Governments may have to persuade people to eat less meat because of increasing demands on water supplies, according to agricultural scientists investigating how the world can best feed itself

<p>[...]"Western diets, which depend largely on meat, are already putting great pressures on the environment. Meat-eaters consume the equivalent of about 5,000 litres [1,100 gallons] of water a day compared to the 1,000-2,000 litres used by people on vegetarian diets in developing countries. All that water has to come from somewhere."
&raquo;
<p>--<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/water/story/0,13790,1288702,00.html">"Meat-eaters soak up the world's water:</a> A change in diets may be necessary to enable developing countries to feed their people, say scientists"</blockquote>
<p>But it'll be easer for people in the rich countries to exercise their Sacred Constitutional right to have thrice-daily lethally chicken-fried baconburgers.  Kiss your ass goodbye, poor people! (Sign my guestbook!)</p>

<i>Meat-eaters consume the equivalent of about 5,000 litres [1,100 gallons] of water a day compared to the 1,000-2,000 litres used by people on vegetarian diets</i>

<p>How many are those "Meat-eaters" and how many are those "on vegetarian diets"? Unless I'm missing something here, that sentence sounds like if there's 5 of the "Meaters" for each vegetarian, then everyone's drinking the same... and that relation is surely over the 5 to 1<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p><p>But anyway, it kind of makes sense... there's probably more water on vegetables then on meat.</p>

It's not just water that the livestock drinks, it's also water to grow all the food that it eats (which is primarily veggies).</p>

Huh?  Those numbers are <i>per person</i>, and "consumption" means water taken out of the reservoirs, or wherever the water comes from.  To sustain one meat-eater, the environment needs to supply 5 kl H2O per day.  To sustain one vegetarian, the environment needs to supply 1-2 kl H2O per day.  Of  course, the environment in any given locale can only supply so much water.  There are two things people can do to stay within that limitation:  (a) Have fewer humans; (b) keep their per-person water needs down.  The prudent approach would do both.

Yes... But I didn't do any fact-checking.  I just re-phrased the factoids from the OP, for the hard-of-grokking.

I can't help but get a little worried every time I see the word 'government' in the same sentence as the word 'persuade'...

How about:  The government is working to persuade you to not starve to death.

Well, they're apparently working too hard on that.  I've gained a child actor in the last eight months.
