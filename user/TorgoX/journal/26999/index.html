<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;Turkey had a higher rate of economic growth than any other EU member
state, he [Blair] said, plus a 'young and vibrant population'.&raquo;<blockquote
>--<a href=
"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1583207,00.html"
>"Failure of the talks 'would betray Turks and Europe'"</a></blockquote></blockquote>

I infer that "young and vibrant" is Blairianese codetalk for "poor and weird".

<p><blockquote
>&laquo;During today's talks, Austrian officials claimed that opposition to
Turkey's entry was widespread in Europe. According to a poll published
yesterday by the Austria Press Agency, 54% of EU citizens oppose
Turkey's accession. The figure rises to 73% in Austria, where
historical suspicion of Turkish imperialism combines with modern-day
fears of Muslim immigration.&raquo;<blockquote
>--<a href=
"http://www.guardian.co.uk/eu/story/0,7369,1583965,00.html"
>"EU and Turkey agree terms"</a></blockquote></blockquote>

What's Turkish for "VergangenheitsbewÃÂ¤ltigung"?

<p><blockquote
>&laquo;[Turkish anti-EU] views are emotional, inchoate and rooted in an increasingly
anachronistic vision of Turkey's past and its destiny. However, they
are tapping into a vein of resentment that could derail the
accession. A whole range of issues underpin the reaction, and most of
them, according to Halil Berktay, professor of history at Sabanci
University, are beyond Western politicians with limited understanding
of the Turkish national psyche.

<p>Though still limited, anti-European feeling, Berktay said, could
easily spread: 'There is a grave danger of a much broader nationalist
backlash, led by retired soldiers, intellectual poseurs, political
opportunists and journalists who pander to a conservative,
quasi-fascistic nationalism.'&raquo;<blockquote
>--<a href=
"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1582950,00.html"
>"A proud Turkey hesitates at the EU crossroads"</a></blockquote></blockquote>

"Let's be friends, or else!!".  Great.
<p>The South will riiiiiiise again!
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;In each case, the EU has demanded that Ankara take steps that the
majority of Turks strongly oppose - recognising Greek-run Cyprus,
giving the Kurds more rights, and accepting that up to a million
Armenians were deliberately killed during the break-up of the Ottoman
empire. Until recently, all three were taboo topics, rarely ever
discussed openly.

<p>"Turks can accept Europe's intervention on issues that are political
and economic, but on these issues they feel it is totally unjust and
unfair," said Ihsan Dagi, a political science professor at Ankara's
Middle East Technical University. "Turks see the EU as a means to
improve their lot. They cannot understand what relevance the Armenian
question, for example, has for Turkey's quest to join the EU."

<p>All three issues had proved to be ammunition for traditional-minded
opponents of EU accession within Turkey, say observers.

<p>"These are highly sensitive subjects for the Turks who unfortunately
get very easily offended," said one EU diplomat. "Invariably, it's
reaction to them that feeds the nationalists which, in turn, upsets
the Europeans - a vicious circle."&raquo;<blockquote
>--<a href=
"http://www.guardian.co.uk/eu/story/0,7369,1583522,00.html"
>"Alien issues fan flames of nationalism"</a></blockquote></blockquote>

Personally, I think that 
an EU without
Turkey could be considered a 
"Christian-only club" only by people who could consider an EU <em>with</em>
Turkey to be a "whites-only club" or a "non-Semites-only club", and so
on, ad nauseam, ad infinitum, ad suckium.

<p>The EU, as it plans to include much of
Eastern Europe, will have more than enough huffy scruffs whose
leisure-time activities are flirtation with
<a href=
"http://interglacial.com/user/sburke/pub/prose/Umberto_Eco_-_Eternal_Fascism.html"
>fascism</a> and being in histrionic denial about their genocidal past.

<p>Adding Turkey to <em>that</em> mix would be redundant.  The
question is whether redundancy is helpful/tolerable/dangerous at this point.
