<p>Dear Log,
<p>Last night, I puttered around some and wrote some contributions to the
upcoming <cite>MS-Word Hacks</cite> book that O'Reilly is doing; mine are mostly from
an RTF/Perl point-of-view, and which I hope will push my
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/rtfpg/">RTF book</a>.
(Next step: profit!)  I came up with some neat tricks that turned out nice.  I also spent a hew hours noodling around with Algorithm::Diff to write a differ that outputs RTF, and it ended up working fine, but I eventually decided that I hadn't done much more than just recapitulating MSWord's
Compare Documents feature.  Ahwell, gotta reinvent the wheel
some time.
<p>I also dug up some macros I've written over the years and sent them off to the book's main author so he can see if he likes any of them.

<p>I finished reading <cite>Pattern Recognition</cite>, and then
read <cite>The Killer Inside Me</cite> in one sitting, something
I don't often do.  Both books were quite good.
<p>Someone brought back the decent weather here, so I am no
longer being roasted alive.  I'm leaving that to the
<a href="http://www.juneauphotos.com/index.asp?r=1408">Juneau people</a>.
<p>I also massaged some code so that my multingual calendar generator now has the months and days-of-the-week for Jicarilla Apache.
<p>I did dishes while the cat berated me for the fact that I am not a giant fillet of halibut.</p>
