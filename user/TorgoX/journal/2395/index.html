<p>Dear Log,
<p>Terry Waite <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,637685,00.html">wrote</a> the other day:
<blockquote>"Americans tell me that they have little patience with international tribunals - they take a long time, and often come up with a different result from that which was hoped. But that is no argument. It doesn't matter how long it takes - justice must be seen to be done, and be done impartially."</blockquote>

<p>But I'm starting to feel that all parties involved are treating "justice" as an agreed-on objective concept, whereas it's actually a very subjective concept that feels <a href="http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/plantanswers/vegetables/sweetpotato.html">different</a> to everyone involved.  One notable difference is that (as far as I can tell), no-one in the US finds international <em>anything</em> to necessarily be right, much less international justice.  "Justice" in the US populace's mind is not some sort of aura that eminates from tribunals of people in robes, but is a matter of "getting the bad guy", and it takes work to remind people of "what if you have the wrong guy?" and "don't set a bad precedent that could be used to oppress innocents later!".

<p>While I do wish the US would be tidier in its treatment of POWs, I think this is best argued as being just the (subjectively!) right thing to do; and that arguments that seek to elevate Western Europe's idea of propriety and procedure to on objective "international law" are pointless.

<p>Maybe justice, like <a href="http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=display&uid=&id=1822">consent</a>, is just something that you "know" that you have when everyone around you agrees that you have it.  (Caveat: make sure everyone around you isn't an idiot.)

<p>So, what is justice?
<br>That is not a Semitic-style rhetorical question, which is asked only when the speaker has The Answer already firmly in mind; but instead it's a real question, asked because there's a blank spot in my brain where I wish the answer were.
