<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;Certainly Akil Sachveda is suffering. He is now a part-time pump attendant in Toronto. He used to own a petrol station, a bar and a pool hall in New Jersey, until one day the FBI came looking for an ex-employee who was a Muslim. The man had left but they arrested Sachveda instead on suspicion of Islamic terrorism, despite the fact he is a Hindu. He was held for five months and given no access to a lawyer. Prison guards threatened his life. Eventually he was deported to Canada. He was never charged, but he had lost everything.&raquo;<p

Is there some insidious new Vedic menace that the FBI knows about that I don't?!?  I better start eating more cow meat and saying bad things about the River Ganges just in case.</p>

With, I'm sure, plenty of armed guards to protect him from the "citizens".

Unfortunately the Observer seems to have overstated the case a bit. It's depressing since the case is already disturbing. Why do they have to dumb it down?<br/><br/>A little Googling shows that Akil Sachveda was a plaintiff in a constitutional-rights case. They say all the plaintiffs are Muslim. Furthermore Akil Sachveda was an immigrant to Canada, temporarily married to an American green card holder.<br/><br/>http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/legal/september_11th/sept11Article.asp?ObjID=35KQUuFRO<nobr>g<wbr></nobr>  &amp;Content=96

<a href="http://www.eff.org/issues/usapa/" title="eff.org">EFF</a eff.org> have a good page describing the USA Patriot Act, why it's not such a good idea, and what to do about it.
