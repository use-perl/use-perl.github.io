<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;Winston sat for a minute or two gazing at his empty glass, and hardly
noticed when his feet carried him out into the street again. Within
twenty years at the most, he reflected, the huge and simple question,
'Was life better before the Revolution than it is now?' would have
ceased once and for all to be answerable. But in effect it was
unanswerable even now, since the few scattered survivors from the
ancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another. They
remembered a million useless things, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt
for a lost bicycle pump, the expression on a long-dead sister's face,
the swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago: but all the
relevant facts were outside the range of their vision. They were like
the ant, which can see small objects but not large ones. And when memory
failed and written records were falsified -- when that happened, the
claim of the Party to have improved the conditions of human life had got
to be accepted, because there did not exist, and never again could
exist, any standard against which it could be tested.&raquo;
<p>--<a href="http://www.online-literature.com/view.php/1984/8?term=pint">From
chapter 8 of <cite>1984</cite></a></blockquote>

On its good days, working on endangered languages is brilliant and fascinating.  On the bad days, the materials are infantile, like rehashing "me llamo Brad" a million times; and the sessions with the elders are like the bit from 1984 -- except that it's more like a Who's On First bit:
<blockquote>-- So there's this sentence we recorded, "glork glom glukh" [or whatever]"
<p>-- "Then he ran".  It <em>refers</em> to running!
<p>-- Right.  Now, this "glukh", I'd have expected "glogh" instead of
"glukh".
<p>-- Oh that sounds Navajo!
<p>-- What, what sounds Navajo?
<p>-- When you say it that way.
<p>-- "Glogh"?
<p>-- [giggles]
<p>-- Or was it "glukh" that sounded like a Navajo saying "he ran"?
<p>-- Oh now you said it like it's a bad word!  or like he's tired!  Like "gluuuuuuukhkhhh!".  Hah!
<p>-- Ummm.  Hmm.  Okay.  Uh... Now, how would you say "I ran"?
<p>-- You'd say "klong" [<em>that you were running</em>] to say you ran.
<p>-- Yeah, but not "you ran", that's got the k- prefix for "you".  I
mean if <em>I</em> were speaking, how would I say the word "I ran".
<p>-- Ooooh.  "Klekh".  [<em>you have run there</em>]
<p>[Continue for an hour, until your head explodes.]
