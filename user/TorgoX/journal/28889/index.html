<p><p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;If you ask my eight-year-old about the Future, he pretty much thinks
the world is going to end, and that's it. Most likely global warming,
he says&#160;-- floods, storms, desertification&#160;-- but the
possibility of viral pandemic, meteor impact, or some kind of nuclear
exchange is not alien to his view of the days to come. Maybe not
tomorrow, or a year from now. The kid is more than capable of
generating a full head of optimistic steam about next week, next
vacation, his tenth birthday. It's only the world a hundred years on
that leaves his hopes a blank. My son seems to take the end of
everything, of all human endeavor and creation, for granted. He sees
himself as living on the last page, if not in the last paragraph, of a
long, strange and bewildering book. If you had told me, when I was
eight, that a little kid of the future would feel that way&#160;-- and
that what's more, he would see a certain justice in our eventual
extinction, would think the world was better off without human beings
in it&#160;-- that would have been even worse than hearing that in
2006 there are no hydroponic megafarms, no human colonies on Mars, no
personal jetpacks for everyone. That would truly have broken my
heart.&raquo;<blockquote
