<p>Dear Log,
<p>As true in the UK (where it was written) as in the US (where I read it):
<blockquote>&laquo;Everyone claims to care about local democracy - but many secretly think it is petty and
dull. Some people, in effect, are more "local" than others, and this is, fundamentally, a class
issue. If you live in private housing, have a car, send your children to private schools (or have
none) the council may seem to do little except empty your bins. If you are, say, a council tenant,
elderly, with no car, your life is lived very locally indeed and issues like the state of the paving
slabs (unevenness may trip you as you walk to the shops) are of real concern.&raquo;<p

I just went to the annual town meeting last night, and had it not been for my daughter's birth, I'd still be on the town finance committee.<br> <br>The moderator started off the meeting noting that this is one of the most pure forms of democracy left.  Everyone in the town has an equal voice at town meeting, where all the major decisions for the year are made.  Of course, it's rare that the people really understand the issues at hand, and they usually just go along with the recommendations of the selectmen (town council).<br> <br>But people do have options in a very real sense.  Last night people ignorantly voted down something recommended by all the leadership of the town, a simple provision to allow the selectmen to approve permits for holiday displays, shortening the time needed to get the permit.  People thought that it would require people to get permits for all holiday displays, while in reality it just streamlined the process for existing permit requirements.  So it was voted down.  Yay democracy!  Power to the people!<br> <br>Anyway, a lot of it is pretty silly, but someone has to take care of it.<br>



<h2>Local elections</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-05-21T22:02:57</h3>
At our recent local elections only 3 parties took part: Labour, Conservative, and the UK Independance Party. This is for a town the size of Gloucester re-electing their entire chamber! I was incensed, and ended up not voting (as did my wife) - I'd rather choose nothing than the best of three bad options.<br> <br>So it seems that it's not just residents who don't take local politics seriously, but also the political parties.

  I don't mean to lecture, but what else do you expect (if not personally implicated in politics) than to get to choose between "the best of three bad options"?  I would have thought, or at least hoped, that the recent events in various european coutries and notably the french presidentials would have shown people that a bad option is indeed better than a worse option. The fact that there is no dream team doesn't make it less important.
</p>

<p>
  What are the rules in the UK for parties that run for local elections? In France it was frequent that parties that didn't stand a chance wouldn't run because of the costs, until the government decided to finance the simple fact of running so that everyone would get a chance (of course, that has perverse effects, but I think it's better for "democracy").

I merely wish for my party of choice to have enough interest to actually put up candidates. I'm not talking about some loony edge party either - I'm talking about the Liberal Democrats, who regularly receive about 20% of the votes in this country.<br> <br>I don't think it's too much to ask for, however I will say I felt no small amount of guilt when actually not voting. And it's not like I decided to completely abstain and stay away - I was actually at the polling booth at the time, and given that the two choices were between Labour and Conservative (both posting three candidates), I think not voting was the right choice then.<br> <br>I believe our parties are all self funded, even at local elections. I like the idea of the government paying for it, but I can see how that might be easily abused (or very annoying to see the "joke" parties take money from the system).

  I didn't mean to cast a stone, and I know how hard it can be to vote for someone that isn't in accordance with your views... In your case I'd probably have hesitated between the lesser evil and a blank vote (well, as you know in your case I'd have voted Labour, but that's another story<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-).
</p>

<p>
  As for govt funding of elections, I don't think the way it's done here is perfect, but it also isn't too bad. It was created to avoid the abuses that parties went through in order to fund themselves (mostly various forms of corruption). The amount of money you get (for the parliamentary elections, financing varies according to the election type) is proportional to 1) the number of candidates you submit (knowing that there are ~580 districts) and 2) the score you get. Yes, that means that some joke parties do get some funding, but they won't get much because lining up 580 people is going to be tough, and they won't score high.
</p>

<p>
  The perverse side of this system is that it makes it hard for parties to agree on a pre-electoral alliance. At this year's elections (in June) the left-wing parties (Socialists, Greens, Communists, and Left Radicals) wanted to forge an alliance in order to have greater chances to win which is imho a great idea. However that meant that some of them will line up fewer candidates and thus get less money, which made the negociations a lot tougher than they needed be (but they eventually succeeded).
