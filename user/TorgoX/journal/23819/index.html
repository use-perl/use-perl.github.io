<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;
Jacques Chirac [...] urged the EU to oblige [in removing the EU arms embargo on China]. Meanwhile, he declared 2004 the "year of China", painted (or rather, illuminated) the Eiffel Tower red, backed the Chinese official position on Taiwan and failed to criticise its record on human rights. His servility was rewarded with a few trade contracts and qualified Chinese endorsement of his vision of a "multipolar" world, to counterbalance American power.
<br>[...]<br>
According to a report in the Economist, some 6.7% of Chinese arms imports actually come from the US, compared to just 2.7% from Europe. American Humvees are produced in China for the People's Liberation Army. Robert Kagan interpreted the contrast between US and European approaches to international relations as Hobbes versus Kant, but where trade is concerned, it's Humbug versus Cant.&raquo;
	<blockquote>--<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/eu/story/0,7369,1444661,00.html">"Chasing the dragon"</a>: It should not have taken US pressure to keep Europe from selling arms to China</blockquote></blockquote>
If the US outlawed trepanning, Chirac would run and get a drill.
<p>Meanwhile, it's <em>totally okay</em> that a billion poor Chinese people are being taxed to bejesus and back, to pay the rest of the world to give it guns and missiles in an arms race with Taiwan, which is about as great a menace to China as the Maldives are to India.
<p>What did the last Easter Islander say as he chopped down <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/orwell/1984/17/">the last tree</a>?</p>
