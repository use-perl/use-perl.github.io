<p>Dear Log,
<blockquote>&laquo;Those who argue that we need food security are fighting the last war - and the real
victims are the desperately poor farmers in the developing world. Not only are they
unable to sell their goods in our markets because our agriculture industry is
protected by high tariffs, but their livelihoods are threatened when we dump
mountains of artificially cheap crops on their doorstep. 
<p>No other industry is allowed to behave like this. If South Korea were to dump colour
televisions on European markets at below production price, Brussels would have a
cast-iron case for hitting it with sanctions under global trading rules. But
anti-dumping rules only apply in manufactured goods - not entirely coincidence you
might think when the powerful trading blocs that drive the agenda in the World
Trade Organisation, Europe, the US and Japan, are the biggest subsidisers of
agriculture.&raquo;<p

This is one of my many issues with the Meat industry - having been a vegetarian for nigh on 6 years I pay taxes to subsidise an inefficient and environmentally harmful industry to slaughter animals for a quick buck.<br> <br>Then they have the cheek to advertise on UK TV lies about Red Meat being good for you when it isn't at all. Its not necessary for the human diet.

It's not a lie.  Red meat certainly is good me.  And it is necessary for my diet.  You are entirely wrong.

Stuff whether it's good for me. I like the taste, damnit.<br> <br> <code> <br>my $dinner = new Steak;<br>$dinner-&gt;done("fit for a vampire");<br>$dinner-&gt;eat;<br> <br> </code>

Red meat is does more harm than good to your body. Even if its 'lean' it still contains a lot of fat and exactly the kind of fat you want to avoid.<br> <br>I suppose you wouldn't care that by the time you die most americans have over a kilo of rotten meat sitting in the digestive system. Red meat *is* linked to digestive system illness and cancer within the digestive system.<br> <br>Red meat is bad for you outside of very small doses. Unlike salt which is a necessary part of your diet - red meat is entirely un-necessary.

<em>Red meat does more harm than good to your body.</em> <br> <br>Not for my body, no.  It does far more good than harm for me.<br> <br> <em>Even if its 'lean' it still contains a lot of fat and exactly the kind of fat you want to avoid.</em> <br> <br>Maybe YOU want to avoid it.  I don't.<br>

It's bad enough when the meat comes from healthy animals.  The surprising thing is how common it is for red meat in the US to come from
<a href="http://freshair.npr.org/dayFA.cfm?display=day&amp;todayDate=04%2F03%2F2002" title="npr.org">drug-soaked sick animals.</a npr.org>  Antibiotics residues and bovine growth hormones, YUM!  It's almost enough to make you not care about mere bioaccumulation of more mundane toxins.
