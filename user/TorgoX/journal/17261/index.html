<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;BILL MOYERS:  You say <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0807123668">in this book</a>-- you say that invective works today, that we have become a politics of invective, and that-- well, who's better at it, the liberals or the-- or the right?
<p>DAN T. CARTER: Well obviously-- I think the right is. There's-- you know, the standard line is that liberals see three sides to every two sides. And that-- it's very difficult under those circumstances to get really worked up.
<p>But conservatives certainly do have a sense of anger. And I want to-- I want to emphasize that this anger comes from so many different sources. And much of it is simply a response to modernization.
<p>BILL MOYERS: Modernization being?
<p>DAN T. CARTER: And to the media. I mean-- talking to people I'm struck again and again, those who are so angry by how much they're responding to things they see on television.
<p>And I find this extraordinary. Back in the 1950s, I could remember being around whites who would go into a rage when a black person would come on television. Well now, they respond with rage whenever a gay couple comes on.
<p>In both cases, it seems to me, they're powerful symbols of this sense that modernization, television, the whole thing that we're experiencing in the consumer culture, is undercutting traditional values.&raquo;

Right, because liberals don't get all worked up when Bush comes on TV.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

And OMG, the interview you link to *starts out* with Byron Dorgan, a liberal Democrat, who is the angriest man in Washington that I've seen in the last year.  His default mode is the scowling shout.
