<p>Few things annoy me as much as the <a href="http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/cart/modules/templates/uhpress/images/UHP_mast-01-02.gif">Hawaiians</a> insisting that their glottal stop character be expressed as a &lsquo; character, whereas every other language in the world happily uses a ' or a &rsquo; character for such things.  The Hawaiian way is just shy of insisting that every "i" be dotted with a happyface, or with the <a href="http://www.freenorthkorea.net/archives/freenorthkorea/000534.html">North Korean</a> flag or something.<br/><br/></p>

<h2>On characters and glyph variants</h2>

And then there's the Romanians who insisted on having a proper s-with-comma-below, giving us U+0219. (Previously, as I understand it, the Unicode Consortium's official position was that it was a glyph variant of s-with-cedilla, U+015F, as used e.g. in Turkish.)<br> <br>I wonder whether U+0163 LATIN SMALL LETTER T WITH CEDILLA is used at all, then?<br> <br>Theoretically, language-tagging should produce an appropriate glyph (similar to one of the issues with Han unification). Just as for German, the appropriate glyph for "closing quote" should selected... one of my pet peeves.<br> <br>Especially Microsoft's Courier New has a glyph that is unsuitable for German -- in it, U+201C LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK and U+201D RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK look like acute and grace accents, respectively (<tt>\\<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>//</tt> rather than <tt>66<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... 99</tt>), which is fine for English, but German uses low-99 for beginning and high-66 for the ending of a quote, and if you reduce those to straight lines, they should be<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>//</tt> at the bottom and then<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>//</tt> at the top, whereas Courier New gives you<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>//<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... \\</tt> which looks roughly as nice as<nobr> <wbr></nobr>,,this``.

<i>Few things annoy me as much as the Hawaiians insisting that their glottal stop character be expressed as a &#8216; character</i> <br> <br>Yeah, that really burns me up.  It's almost as bad as the Turks and their dotless <b>i</b>s, not to mention the Icelanders and their thorns and edhs.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>;-)</code>
