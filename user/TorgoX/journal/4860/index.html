<p>Dear Log,
<p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/quidity/journal/4828">Quidity</a>
<a href="http://the.earth.li/user/alex/recruit.html">said</a> in a fine essay:
<blockquote>The invitations [from HR at different companies, for second-round interviews]
             themselves were often a source of much
             amusement for me as I was subjected to some of
             the worst English I have read for some time. In
             one case a spell checker had turned me from a
             graduate into a gratuity...
</blockquote>
I am tempted to mythologize and to say that in the past, the average schmo had a better command of English.
<br>But regardless of how it was in the past, it's definitely pretty bad now.
<p>At a company I used to work at, I didn't compose materials that clients would see; but I told the people who did that I would gladly proofread whatever they wanted me to look at, as I had some skill as a proofreader.
While some people gladly accepted (whereupon I caught everything from "in that vain" when "in that vein" was meant, to finding uncountably many cases of "its"/"it's" confusion), the worst offenders continued to assume that their error-thick English was just fine, and that the errors I saw were proof only of my pedantry, and of my desire to just make trouble.
<p>I tried to make it clear that occasionally confusing "their" and "they're" doesn't make you a bad person (and in fact, many very smart people have actual "learning disabilities", to use a loaded term, that make it very hard for them to distinguish such things), but still it does look bad if the wrong form gets into print in a company contract or brochure.  Alas, somehow, many people seem to think that "proofreader" is one of those funny old words that doesn't refer to anything anymore, "scullery maid".

<p>At times, I thought:  I would not be so annoyed with the HR people if they had actual obvious job skills <em>or</em> knew the difference between "their" and "they're".  But the fact that they were feckless <em>and</em> couldn't produce decent written English just made me think that their jobs were some sort of makework for middle-class people who would feel "status-deprived" if they had actually socially useful jobs like waiting tables, or driving busses, or being a clerk at the public library.</p>

<h2>Troublemakers</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/citizenx/">citizenx</a> on 2002-05-13T14:50:00</h3>
My coworker and friend Andrew once got a talking-to about "making trouble" with all his suggestions about the database.  Caring about what you work on and wanting a product to be good shouldn't equate "making trouble" in a sane world.  Sadly, there are many egos to be bruised, deadlines to be met (whether the product is ready or not), and other such nonsense.<br> <br>I guess a manager's perfect world would be filled with meek subordinates who unquestioningly follow every order without thinking.<br> <br>Yow!  Are we READY for ANOTHER ROUND of NUREMBERG TRIALS yet!?
