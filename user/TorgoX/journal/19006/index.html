<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;Among the more amusing cluckings from the right lately is their appalled discovery that quite a few Americans actually think George W. Bush is a terrible President.
<p>Robert Novak is quoted as saying in all his forty-four years of covering politics, he has never seen anything like the detestation of Bush. Charles Krauthammer managed to write an entire essay on the topic of "Bush-haters" in <cite>Time</cite> magazine as though he had never before come across a similiar phenomenon.
<p>Oh, I stretch memory way back, so far back, all the way back to--our last President.&raquo;
<p>--<a href="http://www.progressive.org/nov03/ivin1103.html">"Call Me a Bush-Hater"</a></blockquote>
Meanwhile...
<blockquote>&laquo;One problem with this referendum [this upcoming US president election]
is that the case against George Bush is much too strong. Just to spell it out is to sound like a bitter partisan. I sit here on the 67th birthday of Saddam Hussein facing a haystack of incriminating evidence that comes almost to my armpit. What matters most, what signifies? Journalists used to look for the smoking gun, but this time we have the cannons of Waterloo, we have Gettysburg and Sevastopol, we have enough gun smoke to cause asthma in heaven. I'm overwhelmed.&raquo;
<p>--<a href="http://www.indyweek.com/durham/current/news.html">"With trembling fingers"</a></blockquote>
Meanwhile...
<blockquote>&laquo;Democrats suspect President Bush, who met privately with the Saudi Arabian ambassador, Prince Bandar bin Sultan bin Abdul Aziz, on the morning of Sept. 13, 2001, may have personally authorized the controversial flights, several of which took place when <em>all other U.S. commercial air travel had been halted.</em>&raquo;
<p>--<a href="http://www.thehill.com/news/051804/binladen.aspx">"Who let bin Ladens leave U.S.?"</a></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the new parlor game among historians is apparently
<a href="http://hnn.us/articles/5019.html">"Who is Bush the worst president since?"</a>
<p>Also:
<blockquote>&laquo;What I mean to say is the next time you hear someone lamenting how unexpectedly things have gone wrong, remember there's a special room in hell reserved for people who found it convenient not to know. It's going to be standing room only, at this rate.&raquo;
<p>--<a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/tripp05292004.html">"Expedience: They Fiddled While Nero Got the Matches"</a></blockquote>
OBOY, A PARTY!  I'll bring the "GWOCK"!!!</p>

If Iraq becomes the leading democratic Arab nation in the world, Bush will be remembered as one of the greatest Presidents.  Historians should know better than to try to evaluate the President in terms of what is happening now, instead of how things turn out.<br> <br>And looking at his handling of legislation, he's gotten almost everything he's wanted, and the economy is on its way up (though again, we won't know much about the economy now for another few years, probably).  That's a failure?  Reading on, you see that at least some of the historians were looking at the question from their own political viewpoint, so they are basically saying "I disagree with Bush."  Yawn.<br>
