<div class="span8">
<p>Dear Log,
<p>Since I had
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/TorgoX/journal/20349">barely a moment to breathe</a>
between OSCon and my parents coming to visit, my week in Portland is now mostly
an indistinct blur of
<a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-07-26_rishus_and_may/13">cats</a>
and
<a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-07-28_portland/the_cubing">computer graphics</a>
and
<a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-07-29_auction/and_so_it_begins">kooks
ready for action</a>.  Let's see what I can remember.

<p>I stayed with my old friend
<a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-07-29_kitties/rishus_may_sam_1">Sam</a>,
who lives just a short way from the conference hotel, and was kind enough to
play host.  I hereby dub him "Sam the Localhost (127.0.0.1)".

<p>While it was shockingly hot a day or two before I got to Portland, it cooled down
tolerably for the whole week.
<p>I finally got the hang of
<a href="http://www.trimet.org/arrivals/tracker.html?direction=1&routeNumber=110&locationID=7110">the
bus system there</a>, so I could walk out from the hotel and be back at Sam's place in under ten minutes,
or vice versa.

<p>I remember happy BOFs, even tho
<a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-07-29_rss_bof/">some pictures</a>
that I snuck in one of them makes it look like we're a (underdressed)
meeting of board of the Soylent Corporation.

<p>I remember it being decided, by consensus of an ad-hoc group, that when
the movie version of #perl is made, I will be played by
<a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0829390/">French Stewart.</a>


<p>By some fun quirk of ontology, my conference badge had an Imperial purple
ribbon on it, saying "VIP".  (That actually means I was comped, but for no particular reason like speaking
or giving a tutorial or anything.)  Since I was the only person in sight with
this ribbon, this made people assume I was from the Trilateral Commission or something,
and that making me happy was their ticket to the bigtime.  People saw me and
<em>thanked me for being there,</em> even when being there is just about all I was doing.

<p>In the RSS BOF (the topic: people poll our feeds waaaay too much), my
purple ribbon impressed no-one, but I ended up mentioning a feed of mine as an
example of a feed that <em>really</em> needn't be polled every few minutes,
namely, the
<a href="http://interglacial.com/rss/homestar.rss">RSS for Homestar Runner,</a>
which is run by me, glorious
me.  There was almost a gasp.  <em>Homestar Runner!</em>  Oh yes.  Homestar Runner.
By me.  RSS.  Me.  And from that point on, I was hailed as the optimal
manifestation of all that is good and right in the world.  Me.

<p>On Saturday, me and Sam went to Fry's (the Walmart of shiny things),
to get some more memory for my aging laptop.  This turned out to be a
typical adventure, but the <a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-07-31_portland_final/keystone_komputing_and_my_laptop">screwdriver slaves</a>
eventually did figure out how to open my laptop up and put memory in it.  For that, I salute them!
<br>As they puzzled over this, me and Sam meandered around, and I bought
the DVDs of <cite>The Office</cite> season 1,
<cite>Invader Zim</cite> season 1,
and a marked down and otherwise greatly underappreciated title,
<cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1565924789/">Programming
Web Graphics with Perl &amp; GNU Software</a></cite>, to which I am
now providing a good home.

<p>The flights to and from the conference were quick and uneventful,
thanks to pleasant weather, good piloting, and the merry spectrum of
drugs I took.  Drugs do a body good!

<p>That's funny, one of my co-workers has been after me for a few weeks to check out Homestar Runner. It's one of her favorite sites. It's a small twisted world after all!</p>
