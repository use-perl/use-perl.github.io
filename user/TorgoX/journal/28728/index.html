<p><p><em>Or: The Regeneration of Swine</em>
<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;There isn't a big difference between
taking away a woman's right to
emergency contraception, and taking away a gay person's right to be a
gay person. A lot of young people regard a threat against one person's
sexual freedom as a threat against all of them, and that's absolutely
how they should regard it. But it's heartening to look at the polls on
young people on gay people, gay marriage, and sexual-freedom
issues. They're terrific, and that's why the religious right is so
desperately trying to lock in their current bare majority for
prejudice: because their constituents are dying. They're losing votes
every time the ambulance pulls up to the old folks' home. Let's hope
it pulls up a little more frequently.&raquo;<blockquote

I think the idea that the US's ever-promising youth won't end up just as bigoted as the previous <a href="http://interglacial.com/user/sburke/pub/prose/William_S_Burroughs_-_The_Thanksgiving_Prayer.html">generations</a>
of <a href=
"http://interglacial.com/user/sburke/pub/prose/Mark_Twain_-_The_War_Prayer.html"
>goons</a>, is tempting, but is basically an act of breathtaking optimism.

<br><br>Everyone <em>starts out</em>
<a href="http://normanwilkerson.com/stanhope">edgy</a> and (r)evolutionary, but fast-forward a few years and they have two kids going to the church-school 'round the corner (because, you know, the public schools around here are, uh, <em>you know...</em>); and passing around a petition to have Ronald Reagan canonized; and "legalize it!" stops being about marijuana for AIDS and cancer patients, and starts being about government vouchers to pay for little Skeetmore's tuition at Jesus Obedience Academy.  Folks, "middle-age spread" starts early, and begins by depositing dense fatty tissue in the <em>brain.</em>  Case in point:

<p><blockquote>&laquo;The Greatest Generation -- The Sham: The baby
boomers felt shitty
about themselves for throwing a decade long hissy-fit at their parents
in the 60s, and for bringing on America's first loss ever in a war. So
they did what all idiots do: in the 90s, just before their parents
died, they flip-flopped their original idiocy by naming their hokey,
bigoted, stingy, boring parents the "Greatest Generation," allegedly
for all the quiet sacrifice in WW2. Sacrifice? Right. They sacrificed
20 million Russians against the Nazis before invading a resort beach,
then they wine-tasted their way to Potsdam while the Russians
literally redefined the German gene pool. Oh, and the Greatest
Generation sacrificed a few thumb-calluses when they firebombed and
nuked every single German and Jap city once their air forces were
wiped out. They had a hokey sense of humor, no taste in books, in
movies, in drugs, in hairdos, in every single thing imaginable. And
the only reason they're around to tell the tale is because of Russia's
sacrifice. The Greatest Shameration.&raquo;<blockquote
