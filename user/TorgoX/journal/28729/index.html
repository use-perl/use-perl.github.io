<p><p>Dear Log,
<p>So I was reading the first chapter of Italo Calvino's <cite><a
href= "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0156453800" >Invisible
Cities</a></cite> for about the fortieth time, and I noticed something
odd. Here's the chapter:

<p><blockquote>&laquo;Kublai Khan does not necessarily believe
everything Marco Polo says when he describes the cities visited on his
expeditions, but the emperor of the Tartars does continue listening to
the young Venetian with greater attention and curiosity than he shows
any other messenger or explorer of his. In the lives of emperors there
is a moment which follows pride in the boundless extension of the
territories we have conquered, and the melancholy and relief of
knowing we shall soon give up any thought of knowing and understanding
them. There is a sense of emptiness that comes over us at evening,
with the odor of the elephants after the rain and the sandalwood ashes
growing cold in the braziers, a dizziness that makes rivers and
mountains tremble on the fallow curves of the planispheres where they
are portrayed, and rolls up, one after the other, the despatches
announcing to us the collapse of the last enemy troops, from defeat to
defeat, and flakes the wax of the seals of obscure kings who beseech
our armies' protection, offering in exchange annual tributes of
precious metals, tanned hides, and tortoise shell. It is the desperate
moment when we discover that this empire, which had seemed to us the
sum of all wonders, is an endless, formless ruin, that corruption's
gangrene has spread too far to be healed by our scepter, that the
triumph over enemy sovereigns has made us the heirs of their long
undoing. Only in Marco Polo's accounts was Kublai Khan able to
discern, through the walls and towers destined to crumble, the tracery
of a pattern so subtle it could escape the termites'
gnawing.&raquo;</blockquote>

And what I had missed, the first forty times through, was this:

<p><blockquote>&laquo;...In the lives of emperors there is a moment
which follows pride in the boundless extension of the territories
<b>we</b> have conquered, and the melancholy and relief of knowing
<b>we</b> shall soon give up any thought of knowing and understanding

undoing..&raquo;</blockquote>

So... who's "we"?  Except for the above, I see no hints anywhere else
in the book about the identity of the narrator.  But the above
implicates that the narrator is <em>another emperor.</em>  One of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire">later khans</a>,
I have to assume.  I can't imagine merely one of Kublai's ministers
presuming to refer to <em>our</em> scepter, or that in the lives of
emperors there is a moment that comes over <em>us,</em> etc.</p>
