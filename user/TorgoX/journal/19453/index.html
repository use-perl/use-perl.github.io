Nah, they just go down to the forest and pick them off trees.

Never ever?  Not even a $5 "1001 Fonts!!" CDROM in 1994?

That pretty much predates my computerness.<br/><br/>My cousin, on the other hand, is a font slut and has probably purchased one or more of those...

Not a penny ever.

I <b>am</b> a font!<p>Further, most Bodoni family males tend to resemble the typeface: we're round in the middle, with small feet.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p><p>John</p>



<h2>I bought the Adobe family of Arial and</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2004-06-24T07:33:35</h3>
Lucida a few years back and I've bought a couple of fonts from P22. Yeah, I pay for fonts.



<h2>1995</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grantm/">grantm</a> on 2004-06-24T08:40:40</h3>
<p>I bought a copy of Corel Draw 6 in 1995 and it came with over 1000 true type fonts - I've probably used about a dozen.</p>

<p>At work, I've needed to buy a few fonts on the company account.  This used to happen quite a bit in the pre-CSS days.  A web site designer would dictate a certain font for headings and we would render dozens of GIF images.  These days of course I just say no.</p>



<h2>Not so long ago</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/essuu/">essuu</a> on 2004-06-24T11:23:14</h3>
We've bought fonts for the company and to work on certain projects for clients.



<h2>JansonText</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jest/">jest</a> on 2004-06-24T13:21:17</h3>
In 1993 or so, I bought Janson for a book I was publishing that I wanted that particular font for. I think that's been it



<h2>late 80's</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/phillup/">phillup</a> on 2004-06-24T13:25:48</h3>
I paid for the 13 standard postscript fonts from Adobe in the late 80's.<br> <br>I was doing desktop publishing on my Amiga and needed them.<br> <br>I think they are free now, but I still have the original disk and the packaging.



<h2>(why is the subject required?)</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mendel/">mendel</a> on 2004-06-24T14:25:10</h3>
I rarely do type-y things anymore. Back when I was still doing web-related stuff I had to buy a handful of fonts to automate in TeX a phonebook that was being done by hand in some Windows software; the only one I remember of those was Frutiger Light Condensed (but we didn't end up using it).<br> <br>If I <i>were</i> the sort to do type-y things, though, I'd be buying fonts regularly, because the quality of the free ones would drive me mad.<br> <br>Oh, I've probably bought letraset since, does that count?



<h2>Once, maybe</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdporter/">jdporter</a> on 2004-06-24T15:45:03</h3>
A few years ago I bought a used baptismal font. Does that count?



<h2>Years ago, or real soon</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brev/">brev</a> on 2004-06-24T17:13:27</h3>
But then, only on behalf of graphic design shops where I worked. I've usually had access to organizations that had paid-up licenses, so I would skim off those.<br> <br>I'm doing a bit of graphics for my aikido dojo and it pains me that I can't afford to get what I want legally. I'm skimming off work again, but it's not very ethical, plus I'm limited to whatever they bought.<br> <br>I may break down and commit a few dollars to this .



<h2>Twice</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2004-06-25T21:33:58</h3>
I twice purchased fonts, both times as part of larger packages, both times Adobe.  Sonata was a music notation font that came with Deluxe Music Construction Set, and Alexandria was a Greek font that came with macBible.  Alexandria was the last one, and that was in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... oh, 1991?<br>
