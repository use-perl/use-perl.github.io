<p>Dear Log,
<blockquote>&laquo;
Far from New Labour rowing back on the Tories' love affair with the
American workplace, as Richard Scase, professor of management
points out, it has extended American managerialism to the public
sector. Now, public and private sector are wrestling with
decentralised management structures, targets, assessments, job
insecurity and monitoring. Much of this has been sold to the
workforce as "empowerment", whereas it is often the opposite. If a
middle manager is given a target and told to ensure it is met, she or
he is left with all the risk of whether it is achieved or not, while the
implied autonomy is close to fictional. Frequently, the higher risk
brings with it longer working hours and stress. Meanwhile the senior
management escapes the accountability built into traditional
hierarchies, as Scase argues in his new book, <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1841121878">Living in the Corporate
Zoo</a></cite>.&raquo;

made the wrong choice"</a>
</blockquote>
By "Anglo-Saxon", I think the writer just means "American".</p>

When I first got my job at my current company, two years ago, I was asked how I saw myself in management in a few years.  !! I don't.  I am not a manager, and don't want to manage.  I want to do work and have someone else tell me what to do.  Autonomy my rear.
