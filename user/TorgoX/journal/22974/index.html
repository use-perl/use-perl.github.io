<div class="span8">
<p>Dear Log,
<p>I've been getting over this cold for about a week now.  Ugh.  In this bleary
state, I can't just sit still and read or watch the television-mo-tron; but I
don't trust myself to do anything substantive like work on Perl code.
So I noodle around with the ultimate harmless no-consequences environment:
PostScript.

<p>And I've been thinking:
At the abstract level there's no great difference between "hello world!" in
Perl, in PostScript, or in HTML.  But even with that in mind, I've recently taken
a liking to the idea of a PostScript document that is different each time you print it.

<p>Now, in theory, this is not greatly different
from just running Unix "fortune", or in hitting a web page that uses JavaScript
to throw a random saying at the screen.  But fortune and a fortune-JavaScript
both have a problem: they're far too fast, so the payoff is too quick, and it's just
some little thing on the screen.  There's no "reveal".
<p>But send
<a href="http://interglacial.com/user/sburke/pub/oblique_strategies.ps">this</a>
(PostScript, one page, about 10KB) to a printer, and
metal parts heat up, chemicals swirl, there's a distant-sounding muffled "foooeee"
sound, and then finally motors slooooowly slide out a PRINTED PAGE.
Special.  Just for you.

<p>(Yes, you can preview in GhostView or whatever, but you know that's just peeking.)
<p>It does everything short of playing a music sting
sound-effect.  TADAAAAAAAAA.
<p><i>PS:</i>  I've thought of making a PS file that, when printed, just spits out a page of freshly generated pseudorandom digits, handy in many technical tasks.  But I don't trust the pseudorandom generators in PostScript implementations to something as important as technical tasks of unknown importance.  For that, it's better to just hardcopy a page of numbers from <a href="http://random.org/">random.org</a>.</p>
