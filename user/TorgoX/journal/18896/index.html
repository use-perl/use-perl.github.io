<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;The result: "The Family Guy" has become Cartoon Network's most-watched series, and it beats David Letterman and Jay Leno's late-night talk shows among the coveted demographic of men 18-34.
<p>A batch of 35 new episodes will begin airing in early 2005 on Cartoon Network and possibly also on Fox.
&raquo;
<p>--<a href="http://www.azcentral.com/ent/tv/articles/0522adultswim.html">"'Adult Swim' puts Cartoon Network in the fast lane"</a></blockquote>
<p>I haven't watched Letterman since the 80s; and as to Leno, I've seen ESL videos more interesting than his show.</p>

<p>Stewie indeed rules.  I wish I had watched Family Guy the first time around.  However, there was a glut of animated sitcoms at the time and I wasn't interested in watching another.
</p><p>My bad.
</p><p>Still, the Family Guy is no Aqua Teen Hunger Force.  The character, Carl, is almost Skakespearean
in his struggles with his neighbors.
</p><p>Carlton, these "colon-blow" extra hot wings are for you, buddy.  Watch your cornhole.</p>

It's weird, I didn't like Family Guy the first
time around either.
I remember absolutely despising the animation style;
and the fact that it was about a family with three
children and a fat idiot father seemed more than just a bit too much like the Simpsons.  And the constant cutaways to 3 or 4 second digressive joke-scenes struck me as just inane.
<p>But, oddly, neither of these things bug me now.</p>

I still don't like Family Guy for those reasons.  It is too random.  I thought about giving it another chance because of testimonials like these, but OTOH, I watch enough TV, I don't need more reasons to watch.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/me hugs his Futurama DVDs

<h2>Letterman</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2004-05-23T14:43:00</h3>
You know, I tried watching Letterman for about a year when I was in grad school.  My conclusion was that he was clearly more interested in himself than his guests, and just wasn't all that funny.  Oh, sure, he had his moments and the top 10 lists are usually good, but other than that there just isn't much to like.  It seems that somehow it became "cool" to like Letterman along the way somewhere and that's why he's managed to survive.
<p>
The one talk show I really liked was Whoopi's.  No formulas.  No movie promotions.  Just sit down and talk about anything.</p>

I remember Letterman being actually funny in like 1985 or so.  But since then, ugh.
<p>I liked Whoopi's show too, and always thought I was the only person watching it!  But the stations/networks put it off in crazy timeslots and so the ratings were nil.  Dang.</p>

<h2>Ha!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/genericus/">genericus</a> on 2004-05-24T00:56:38</h3>
That brought a tear to my eye...



<h2>Jay &amp;amp; Dave</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2004-05-24T14:04:18</h3>
Letterman has always been funny, and still is.  More importantly, he's actually a decent host.
<p>
What makes Leno deathly awful is that he's a terrible host, and a worse interviewer.  He has no idea how to conduct an interview.  Watch Jay interview someone you actually are interested in, and it's a 7-minute train wreck.</p>



<h2>Stewie rules</h2>

This is great news.  I just recently turned off my TiVo "Season Pass" on Family Guy because I'd seen every episode Cartoon Network had aired several times.  Nice to see they'll be back.<br/><br/>And now I can hold out some hope for <i>Futurama</i>...

From what I hear, Fox is being very annoying wrt Futurama.  Possibly to <em>avoid</em> the FG phenomenon, they've not ordered any new episodes of Futurama, but they haven't officially <em>cancelled</em> it, so it can't be taken elsewhere.<br/><br/>So I hear.
