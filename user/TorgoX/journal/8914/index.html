<p>Dear Log,
<p>I keep a moderate amount of music on my laptop, for ready entertainment and ambience.  I know people that keep gigs and gigs of music around; I rarely get above one gig, which is good on this smallish circa-1999 laptop.  In fact, I often delete most of the music directory, and replace it with things from CDs I choose more or less at random.  Something about shuffle-play over a small collection seems to work nicer for me than over a massive collection.
<p>I note that I always have a good amount of mostly-calm instrumental music (filed under "yin") and a slightly greater amount of everything else (filed under "yang" -- I attempt no other classification than that semi-hemi-dualism).  And over the months, about the only constants that I note, have been this:  Yin always has Brian Eno's <cite>Music For Airports</cite>, at least track 1; and Yang always has Fluke's <cite>Risotto</cite>.<br>An ogg of John Cage's <cite>4'33"</cite> also tends to stick around a lot too, especially because it's all of 7K long.
<p>It is interesting to consider that the next hard drive I get will probably be able to easily hold, at once, a rip of every CD I've ever owned.
</p>

<br>On a related note, the pattern for me has been that every time I buy a new computer, I can fit on its hard drive all of the data I have stored on my old computer, plus any external drives/disks/other magnetic media.<br> <br>Buy second computer, dump first computer, one ancient external drive and a zillion disks.<br> <br>Buy third computer, dump second computer, three external drives, a stack of zip disks, all remaining floppies.<br> <br>Haven't bought number four yet.<br> <br>If the pattern holds in the future, I won't buy my fourth computer until it ships with about 500 gig of available storage.<br> <br>-matt<br>

Maxtor just released a 250gig ATA100 drive, expected street price under $400.<p>

Of course, with a $400 3Ware Escalade 8 port raid card, and 8 of the new maxtors, you've got 1.75TB of RAID5 for about $3600.</p><p>
