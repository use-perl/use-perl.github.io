<p>Dear Log,
<p>Ignatz made me <a href="http://www.collectiblestoday.com/ct/product/prdid-912316001.jsp#">look into the void.</a></p>

<p>for us godless heathens? You know, maybe something in a non-sparkly white....I should know better than to graze your journal as I'm having my morning coffee<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) That just hurt my brane.</p>

Athetists can imagine those are the invisible hands of the marketplace.

<h2>Scary.</h2>

For some reason I am reminded of Thomas Kinkade: similar wave of shudder went through my spine.<br>

Mmmmm <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/story/0,3604,751131,00.html" title="guardian.co.uk">Thomas</a guardian.co.uk> <a href="http://www.thomaskinkade.com/" title="thomaskinkade.com">Kinkade!</a thomaskinkade.com><br/><br/><blockquote><div>&laquo;"His paintings have this treacly, sickly sweet aspect which is idealised by Americans," says <em>[San Franciscan artist Jo]</em> Sances. "The objective was to add an element of reality to them. I think the paintings did hit a nerve." He was deluged with emails following the controversy <i>[where he parodied Kinkade's style]</i>: "Nine out of 10 were in favour but the ones that weren't accused me of being unpatriotic and said I should go and live in Afghanistan."&raquo;</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I just don't understand the appeal of these things.  It's the pictorial equivalent of eating a bowl of ketchup.  But so many people seem to have such an earnest appreciation for Kinkade's stuff that I have a hard time dismissing them all as just dumb -- altho it's very tempting.
Maybe I can serenly dismiss them as having some sort of wonky perceptual disorder, like aesthetic tinnitis.

I don't personally like Kinkade, but he is brilliant with light on landscapes.  Too bad that's ALL he is brilliant at.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  I don't have a problem with his work in particular, though; my problem is with the pervasiveness of his work.  He is a fine painter, creating works many people like.  I just wish I didn't see his works everywhere.<br>
