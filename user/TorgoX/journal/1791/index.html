<p>Dear Xmas Log,
<p>I scribbled some Pod parser code today on notepads -- a venerable design methodology, I find.  Lazy days, otherwise: winter makes me sleepy.  Or maybe it's the Paxil.  Effort would be better spent on my book, but I gave the persistent feeling that Pod parsing is more feasible right now, as I try to get programming and my new brain chemistry to play nice together.

<p>Trying to stay away from the computer as much as possible (to give my arms a rest), I baked and cooked:
<br>I started the stock for tomorrow's risotto (new and experimental: veg broth, garlic, red onion, a bit of curry powder my mom sent me in a big Xmas package, a bit of ginger, a bit of shredded carrot, and a good helping of my personally produced chipotle-infused olive oil).
<br>And I made my usual casserole of ziti and fried eggplant.  New discovery: bread the eggplant slices in the coarse blue corn flour that New Mexicans use for atole.  Other discovery: cut the eggplant slabs too thick and they won't drain properly when you salt them to get the bitter taste out.  Altho they <em>do</em> remain firmer, and have a certain tang.

<p>My usual outlet for vegetative tendencies these days is sitting and reading <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">The Guardian</a> in bed.  But they seem not to be updating their web site today, presumably having given people the holiday off, so there's nothing for me to read.  But <a href="http://www.walrus.com/%7Esuave/vivire.ram">I will survive</a>.

<p>I <em>may</em> just resort to something from that stack of books by my bed.  I wonder how one plugs them in.</p>

<h2>Paxil</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chaoticset/">chaoticset</a> on 2001-12-25T15:29:15</h3>
I found the energy level on Paxil to be lower than that of other antidepressants, personally.
<p>
This is for me, of course -- I tend towards drug resistance.  Your body chemistry will vary.</p>
