<p>Dear Log,

<p>So there's this <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3040891.stm">court
case</a> against a Danish museum curator, who hosted an art exhibit
inviting members of the public to turn on blenders with live goldfish in them.
Press the button to turn on the blender, and the goldfish are
reduced to a light frapp&eacute;.
In defending himself (successfully) against a charge of cruelty
against animals, the curator said:

<blockquote>"It's a question of principle. An artist has the right to
create works which defy our concept of what is right and what is wrong,"
he <em>[Peter Meyer, director of the Trapholt Art Museum]</em> told the
court in Kolding.</blockquote>

<p>I hereby invite members of the public to cut off one of Peter Meyer's
fingers (painlessly, we hope). To the first person who does this, I will
pay a plastic bag of pre-Euro European money (presumably now worthless)
that I have around my apartment someplace.  Or half a bag to anyone who
painlessly hurls any of Peter Meyer's pets into a woodchipper.  Or a quarter of a bag to anyone
who pummels to death an EU lawyer/judge/legalist with their own briefcase (painlessly).

<p>Some would say that this is an extreme act on my part.  But I point
out that I am (hereby) an artist, and this is
a question of principle. An artist has the right to
create works which defy our concept of what is right and what is wrong.
</p>

I declare his art, and yours, to be deficient in scope and creativity. My concept is that the next eight babies to die on this Earth are my ART. And their death, their beauty, and their parents' anguish are MINE! And I am going to sell this concept in New York City for U.S. Dollars! Adore me.

I hereby award you a "community theater" grant.  I have extracted a small finder's fee, in the form of stem cells.  But you have to guess from where!  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
