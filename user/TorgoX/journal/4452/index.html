<p>&lt;TorgoX> So... I was watching PBS News yesterday.  And to talk about the civil war in Greater Israel (which I hereby re-name <a href="http://www.geocities.com/azraelabyss.geo/gtmain.html">"Azrael Abyss"</a>), they had <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/jan-june02/perspectives_4-23.html">the head of the Suthuhn Baptists' main seminary.</a>
<p>&lt;TorgoX> So... what next?  Oral Roberts to talk about global warming?
<p>&lt;Krankor> no probably Alan Greenspan to talk about the challenges of interracial marriage

<p>&lt;TorgoX> meanwhile, well-known senior citizen news anchress Connie Chung was on CNN grilling some Catholic bishop about whether there were too many gay people being priests and <em>therefore</em> molesters.
<p>&lt;Ringo> Connie Chung is over the hill

Some fundamentalists tend to pay a lot of attention to the details of events in the Greater Metropolitan Holy Land.  A <em>lot</em> of rapt attention. (Pun intended.) Which is plenty reason right there to grab that bottle of Beam and drink deeply.

<p>As for pharmacists, they have mighty powers indeed.  They could lose their own license (and voting rights, several years of their lives, etc.) if they give a bad prescription: i.e. if a bug-eyed gent comes in at 2 a.m. with a piece of kleenex emblazoned "GIV HEM SOME DRGZ. - Dr. Smith, Lutheran Space General".  Or many less clear-cut situations.  Consequently, they have the veto power of ten ordinary men.  Deny them (if that's even legal to do so) and they will find other places to work; I understand there's actually a bit of a pharmacist shortage right now.</p>

<p>That doesn't exactly zip the Suhthuhn Baptists to the top of the attention queue tho.  For example, I'd be rather more interested in what Egyptian Copts think of the whole situation.</p>

No, I agree with what you said<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... just the idea that frag said, that we should be concerned that they pay attention to what's going on in the region, strikes me as odd.<br> <br>A lot of Christian professors do (although perhaps more than that don't, but think they do) have an interesting take on what's going on in the region, from a religious perspective; that said, perhaps what is needed right now in the conflict is a lot less talk about religion.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>I had a brilliant Old Testament professor who took students to Israel ever year, and he knew more about the history of the region than anyone else I've met.  But in that respect he was more of a history professor than a theology professor<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>

OK, I should've been more explicit. They (some, that is; not all) are very interested in this particular turf war because they're looking for the signs of the one big Apocaylpse.  And I don't mean "Chapter 29 - Functions".  Looking, and to some extent, <em>hoping</em>.

<p>It's why I find "this car will be unattended in event of Rapture" bumper stickers disturbing; there you have someone proclaiming that they're actually looking forward to the end of the world.  Now more than ever, I find that outlook chilling.</p>

I can't imagine why it is disturbing or chilling, as long as they aren't acting to bring it about.

I don't know about "chilling", but I think it's just creepy.  Millennarian monotheism always seems to boil down to "booooy oh boy, when our surly sky-god wakes up, it'll be a great big shitstorm!   And I'll be off laughing at all the poor idiots who didn't listen to me when I stood by the freeway holding up the sign that said 'SINAR RIPENT FOR THE END IS NEAR HAIL SHIVA'."  Really edifying.

<p>Yow!  Can you feel the Industrial Light and Magic?</p>

Well, your almost complete misrepresentation of the vast majority of people who hold to those beliefs aside, I don't think it's any creepier than the varied beliefs of most of the rest of the country.  *shrug*<br>

People who look forward to events involving the death of others - even when it isn't <em>really</em> the death of others they're wishing for, just that they simply regard any deaths resulting from Armageddon as the inevitable eggs that must be cracked in order for the great Cook to prepare the sacred omelette of the Second Coming - creep me out.  Guilty as charged.

I could respond to that if it made any sense whatsoever.  Ho hum.

<h2>Irony</h2>

<p>As for the other guy being interviewed, I thought it was interesting to hear an Episcopalian of Palestinian descent quote Gandhi making an observation on a passage from the Old Testament.  Go figure!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>BTW, I usually read the New Testament once or twice a year, and it doesn't have near as much to say about Jewish people as folks say it does.  There's a lot of attitudes toward the Jews, both good and bad, that people impute to the New Testament that just aren't there.</p>
