<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;'On Planet Bin Laden, they look first at your nationality. Had we been British - or from another coalition country - we would have been decapitated within days.'&raquo;
<p>--<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1382179,00.html">"'If I had been British, I'd be dead' "</a></blockquote>

Meanwhile, in memory of that old chestnut from 2001, "they hate us because we're free"...

<p><blockquote>&laquo;A British detainee at Guantanamo Bay has told his lawyer he was tortured using the 'strappado', a technique common in Latin American dictatorships in which a prisoner is left suspended from a bar with handcuffs until they cut deeply into his wrists.
<p>The reason, the prisoner says, was that he was caught reciting the Koran at a time when talking was banned.
<p>[...] Under the rules the United States military has imposed for defence lawyers who visit Guantanamo, Stafford Smith [his attourney] has not been allowed to keep his notes of meetings with prisoners, and will not be able to read them again until they have been examined and de-classified by a government censor.
<p>He cannot disclose in public anything the men have told him until it too has been been de-classified, on pain of likely imprisonment in the US.&raquo;
<p>--<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/guantanamo/story/0,13743,1382132,00.html">"	Guantanamo Briton 'in handcuff torture'"</a></blockquote>

So... what does one wear to a kangaroo court?  A funny robe?  Clown shoes and a ballgag?
