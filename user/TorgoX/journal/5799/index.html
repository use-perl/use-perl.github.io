<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;[...]The story of Project Orion was teased from him - and his surviving colleagues - by
George Dyson, his son, who made a career building hi-tech Aleut kayaks in the Pacific
north-west before writing a best-seller history of computing called Darwin Among
The Machines. He wrote it because he realised that the computer pioneers were dying
without telling their stories. 

<p>"As you get older, you realise that unrecorded wisdom is the most valuable thing. So
the book is intended to be a kind of a monument to those people who had all that
imagination, besides my father. The other thing is, I wanted to understand what had
happened. I had grown up with this tremendous curiosity about the project. Imagine
being that age and hearing that your father is working on a spaceship, but he can't
explain it to you."[...]&raquo;<p
