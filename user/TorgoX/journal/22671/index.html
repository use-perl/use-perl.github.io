<p>Dear Log,
<p>I hereby reproduce, for your edification, the lyrics to the two songs I heard while in a cab today.

<p>Blue County - "That's Cool"
<p>Shootin' dr. Pepper cans with your brand new red ryder
<br>That old folding lawn chair makes the perfect x-wing fighter
<br>Those no-name baseball cards spinning in your spokes
<br>Now that's cool
<br>
<br>Turnin' 17 and daddy loosens up the curfew
<br>Drivin' home at midnight that old buick smells like perfume
<br>Making your own money, having coffee with your folks
<br>Now that's cool
<br>
<br>(Chorus:)
<br>Knowin' where you're goin', embracin' where you've been
<br>Being criticized for standin' strong in a battle you can't win
<br>Livin' in a moment you may never see again
<br>Let your heart break some rules
<br>Now that's cool
<br>
<br>Wakin' up with your new bride a room beside the ocean
<br>10 years later goin' back to relive that emotion
<br>She tells you what she's thinking but never says a word
<br>Now that's cool
<br>
<br>(Chorus)
<br>
<br>The pitcher is your six year old, you're his full time catcher
<br>He gets a new bb gun and 'you'll put your eye out' lecture
<br>Your 3 year old is singin' the song that she just learned
<br>Now that's cool
<br>
<br>(Chorus)

<p>~~

<p>Williams Hank Jr, "I'm One of You"

<p>They say it takes more now
<br>To do what our mom and daddies did
<br>They made it look so easy
<br>Working hard and raising kids
<br>If you get in trouble at school
<br>You got in trouble at home
<br>You can't outrun momma's wooden spoon
<br>Or the principle's telephone
<br>Raise your hand if you only had
<br>Three channels on TV
<br>And that little town
<br>That kept you down
<br>Is where you wanna be
<br>
<br>Yeah I'm one of you
<br>Yeah I'm one of you
<br>No you're not by yourself
<br>There's somebody else
<br>Who's been there too
<br>If you still wish you still had
<br>Some growing up to do
<br>You're one of me
<br>And I'm one of you
<br>
<br>Tell the truth
<br>Do you still wonder
<br>How fast your car will go
<br>When Sweet Home Alabama
<br>Comes on the radio
<br>I bet Jesus, and your momma
<br>Now they're way up there
<br>On your mind
<br>Anytime you take a sip
<br>Or you walk across the line
<br>If you understand why your old man
<br>Said the whole world's gone to hell
<br>But you still believe the American Dream
<br>Is alive and well
<br>
<br>I'm one of you
<br>Yeah I'm one of you
<br>No your not by yourself
<br>There's somebody here
<br>Who's been there too
<br>I know what ya thinking
<br>What ya drink
<br>And I know why you do
<br>Your one of me
<br>Yeah and I'm one of you
<br>
<br>Do you feel a little bit
<br>Out of touch
<br>Or politically incorrect
<br>Then you and me both agree
<br>What did you expect
<br>
<br>I'm one of you
<br>Yeah I'm one of you
<br>No, No you're not by yourself
<br>There's somebody else
<br>Who's been there too
<br>I know what you think
<br>About the good ol'
<br>Red, White, and Blue
<br>You're one of me
<br>And I'm one of you
<br>You're one of me
<br>And I'm one of you
