<p><p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;Hundreds of angry emailers accused me, and Hollywood, of trying to
promote "the homosexual agenda" by somehow
"forcing" them to see a movie they found sexually
reprehensible. What those emailers failed to comprehend was that the
Oscar voters shared their distaste for it.&raquo;<blockquote
>--<a href=
"http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/what-did-i-tell-you/"
>"What Did I Tell You?"</a></blockquote></blockquote>
Meanwhile...
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;A few things were surprising: We thought this was going to
be the Gay
Oscars. Instead it was the "Hey, you fearfully ignorant red-state
hick-weeds: Hollywood is America's social conscience and history
proves that we've always been smarter than you" Oscars. Oscar was
being <em>defensive,</em> because Hollywood is tired of being called
dirty names by the no-necked monsters hanging around the White House
bowling alley. [...]

<p>There wasn't even a particularly plunging neckline in sight --
just ill-fitting, strapless, ace-bandage-type '50s ball gowns. Yet
another edict from the brass, I'm sure, which seems to be
nostalgically yearning for nice, decent girls like Debbie Boone. Look
for gloves and headscarves next year, and some kind of rule against
indecent ankle exposure. [...]

<p>I think Hollywood is tacitly endorsing a Good Behavior code that I
find frightening. Sure, the entertainment industrial complex
recognizes minorities and good causes and champions them -- but it
also disallowed the winning song, "It's Hard Out There for a Pimp,"
from using the word "bitches" in the broadcast. I mean,
<em>really.</em> The word "bitch" has been commonplace on prime-time
TV since ... when ... "Dynasty"? At the latest?

<p>George Carlin's act in the early '70s listed the Seven Words You
Can't Say on TV as "shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker
and tits." Not a "bitch" on that list, although it seems to have
suddenly been added. Joan Rivers' red-carpet color commentary was
distinctly decolorized, at least when it came to blue: Her monologue
was bleeped out so often, it had more holes than a document released
through the Freedom of Information Act.

<p>This alarms me.

<p>When you allow permissiveness and open-mindedness to devolve, shut
down and roll back, it's a slippery slope all the way back to the
Stone Age, where pretty soon you won't even be able to swear on TV in
a dead language if you want to.

>"Oscar castrates himself"</a></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>The 19th century European term "bourgeois" and the modern US
term "conservative" (and its euphemistic adjectives "religious" and
"family") are both attempts to denote the same thing:
herd&nbsp;behavior, where the imperative is "do not offend Those Who We Must Not Offend".  It's not even groupthink, because there's not even a pretense of <em>think</em> in it.
<p>Can I just fast-forward past this decade?  This is the worst porn ever.</p>
