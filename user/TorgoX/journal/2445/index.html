<p>The cat has recently made it known to me that he is increasing my allotment of space on the bed from 6 square feet to 5 square feet.  My thankfulness is required.

<h2>cats are bastard people</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjohn/">jjohn</a> on 2002-01-27T15:37:05</h3>
<p>I've been living with <a href="http://marian/img/jjohn_xmas.gif" title="marian">one</a marian> for ten years and I've often described our household as being "occupied territory." You see, my cat is a terrorist. Using guerilla tactics, cruel mind games and low animal cunning, my cat has taken possion of:

</p><ul>
  <li>The one lazy boy chair</li>
  <li>half of my queen-sized bed</li>
  <li>the closet that stores his litter box</li>
</ul>

He rousts me out of bed at the crack of dawn to feed him; he interrupts my work for a head rub; he interrupts again later for more food; finally, he nags me to go to bed at his convenience. With loud, irrating cries and a remarkable amount of vomit, he attempts to rule this household with an iron claw.

<p>But, all is not lost.

</p><p>Thanks to the <a href="http://www.historychannel.com/" title="historychannel.com">History Channel</a historychannel.com> ["All Nazis -- All the time"], I've become aware of counter-terrorism techniques. To that end, I've sealed off the bathroom (which was becoming a new litter box) and obtain several water guns. The beast only respects force!

</p><p>Unfortunately, my counter-terrorism was met by even more insidious doings. After several of my successful campaigns, I began to find my guns <b>broken</b>. My cat was engaging in sabotage!
</p><p>To this day, the struggle continues -- neither side willing to give up. Someday, I've got to bring my cat to the negiotating table. But how?</p>

<p>Time to return fire. I suggest going to kinko's to make a load of leaflets  and <a href="http://www.specialoperations.com/Army/PSYOP/default.html" title="specialoperations.com">engaging in PsyOp</a specialoperations.com> tactics to wear down his resistance.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Once again, your URL is broken for everyone of a certain class of people (those who don't have your hostnames hardcoded into their hosts file or default to your domain).  You<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... bigot.
<br>
<br>But I agree with you: the only thing they respect is force.  My cats try to take over the bed, the chair, the counters.  But I have taught them to fear me.  Usually all it takes is me saying their name in a menacing voice.  Sometimes I have to stand up (they know how I hate to do that, so they wait until I do before they move).  Other times it requires water guns or zrbtts to the tummy (you gotta act fast, though, lest you become a casualty of war).

</p><p>Dude, your like the Rambo of cat owners! I would <em>never</em> put my face that close to his claws during disciplinary action.</p>

Yeah<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... and my cat is especially mean.  The vet uses falcon gloves to handle her.  It usually takes 2-3 people to hold her down.  One time she was really pissed at the vet's office and the vet didn't want anyone to touch her for fear of much blood-letting, but I went over and picked her up.  I 0wnz her.

I'm assuming zrbtts are blowing raspberries on the tummy.
<br>
<br>Strange, <a href="http://home.sergeant.org/Pets_and_Home/DSC00026.JPG" title="sergeant.org">one of our cats</a sergeant.org> loves that. However <a href="http://home.sergeant.org/Pets_and_Home/DSC00005.JPG" title="sergeant.org">one of the dogs</a sergeant.org> absolutely hates it. Can't stand it.

She hates it when I do it, but does nothing to stop me.  Well, she threatens me with her claws, but does not dare use them.
