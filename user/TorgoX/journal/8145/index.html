<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;Capelton is regarded by many critics as a major musical figure, the heir to the legacy of Bob Marley.
He is also one of the leaders of a new wave of fundamentalist burn-again Rastafarianism, Bobo Dread
- known as "the Jamaican Taliban" to their detractors - that is sweeping the island. While Marley's
militancy was softened by a mellow ganja vibe, Capelton's concerts are more like religious revivalist
meetings with fans holding hundreds of burning aerosol cans in the air. 
<p>Capelton insists the fires he sings about throwing gay men into are metaphorical allusions to
cleansing and purity. "Is not really a physical fire. Is really a spiritual fire, and a wordical fire, and a
musical fire," he said. "But people get it on the wrong term. People get confused ... We come to burn
for injustice and inequality and kill indignity and exploitation."&raquo;<p

Yes, the old "jihad al-akbar" ploy, as I call it.  That is, when someone says "Hey, don't you think it's a bit much saying you should run around with a machine gun killing everyone in sight, as you said?", you say "little grasshopper, when I said to run around with a machine gun killing everyone in sight, shooting everyone in the face, as you scream like like a banshee, it was a <em>metaphor</em>, and really means that you should sit serenely and peacefully in a corner and meditate on how you can make yourself a better person.  I am quite taken aback that <em>you</em> misconstrued what I said!"</p>
