<h2>having attended an all-girls high school...</h2>

<p>If you put a group of green berets in my highschool they would have emerged crying and running for their lives. This ain't news any more than the Amazons are news.</p>

I think the surprising thing was not that the people were so mean, because high school is about everyone being inadvertently dysfunctional; the surprising thing was that the girl (gyrl?) being interviewed was totally oblivious to how inane she was being.

This kind of thing is one of the reasons I wanted a boy and not a girl.  Girls are mean and scary!  My hope is that I can raise my daughter to have enough self-confidence that she won't depend so much on what such people think of her.<br>

But you can bring her up proper, with lots of healthy real-life female role models -- lika Lisa Simpson,
<a href="http://bettyjack.com/funtone/rupauladventures/movies/bootytriple.html" title="bettyjack.com">Ru Paul</a bettyjack.com>, and

<p>Well...there are those who believe it's a function of survival since women, being the childbearing gender, are competitive for the attention of the male. I've always been rather jealous of men for being able to have a real comraderie whereas with women it's competitive even in it's most benevolent forms. We are our own worst enemy.</p>

<p>Well, half of the Open Source crowd can't figure out how inane they are sometimes when they go on rants about software wanting to be free....she's only about 16 so there's still hope for her.</p>

<h2>Disgust Doesn't Cover It</h2>

How utterly fucking awful.  One more little factor weighed on the scale marked 'Maybe I Don't Need Any Friends After All'.



<h2>Knowing your place</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lachoy/">lachoy</a> on 2002-03-11T18:29:19</h3>
<p>One of the few benefits of being on the fringes (geeks/stoners/etc.) is that at least you know your place. I don't know how you'd be able to go to school, facing all that nastiness, if you were constantly watching your back for daggers.

</p><p>Why do so many people think of high school as  one of the high points in their life? If after graduating I believed high school was the best time in my life I probably would have thrown myself off a bridge. And it wasn't even <b>that</b> bad a time. Maybe the idea of high school being a high point is constructed by and for people at the top of the heap at the time.</p>

<p>I liked one of the last comments:

</p><blockquote><div>I ask if boys ever put together three-way calls like that. "Nah," Jackie says. "I don't think they're smart enough."</div></blockquote>
