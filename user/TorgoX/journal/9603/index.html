<div class="span8">
<p>Dear Log,
<p>I needed to call the airline to book my flights out of town, to Juneau,
where I'm moving.  As my hand touched the phone (which I've had for about
five years at least?), a big static shock arcked between my hand and
the phone.  When I was finished swearing at how much it hurt, I picked
up the phone to dial the airline, and found that the static shock had
fried the tone-generator chip in the phone.

<p>So I got in the car to drive to the store to buy a phone (so I could call
the airline!).  On the way back, the car overheats.  It's not even 35F
outside, and I had barely driven it six blocks, but still it
overheated, with the needle going up to the red, into the red, and PAST
the red.

<p>Once the car had cooled down (surprisingly fast), it started okay,
but when put into Drive, only inched forward -- just far enough to get
it over a little rise and into the parking lot of a gas station.  And that's the end of that car.

<p>This is the car, incidentally, which I was only going to use twice in
the next week (to the vet, and to the airport), and then I was going to
donate it to charity.

<p>And on the same day, the CDR/DVD drive in my new laptop stops
working, for no apparent reason -- I didn't drop it or put a cheese
slice in the drive or anything. At the same time, on another computer,
my ICQ account mysteriously stops working.

<p>This degree of sudden failure in unrelated systems belies suggests that
someone has developed some sort of <b>entropy weapon</b>, and has activated it
(or lost control of it?).
I don't know if the weapon's range is the few blocks around my apartment, or is
all of Albuquerque, or the whole state of New Mexico.  But <b>I'm getting the hell
out of here</b> before my DNA unravels and then <a href="http://www.cabq.gov/aes/s1geol.html">the
Earth's crust opens up under me and swallows this whole
tectonic zone</a> in a mess of sink-holes and oozing volcanoes,
eventually making this a
<a href="http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/tour/shiprock.html">desolate Martian
wasteland of tormented-looking geology</a>.
I'm counting the hours until I'm out of here.</p>
