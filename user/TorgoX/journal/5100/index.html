<div class="span8">
<p>Dear Log,<p>Here's an interesting book that I saw talked up by its author on <A HREF="http://www.booktv.org/">BookTV</A> the other
day: <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0922233233"><EM>Junk English</EM></A>.  In theory, it sounds like all of it can be reduced to "say it in a
few simple words, and don't use shill-talk".  But the book actually works through
phrases and formulations that you should not use: don't say "the thought
process" when you can say just "thinking", don't say "on a daily basis" when you
can say just "every day", etc.

<P>Notably, the author independently arrives at something I've complaining about
for years: "issue" when used as a twee synonym for "problem", as in telling your
network admin that you're having "bandwidth issues" instead of "bandwidth
problems".  My standard line on this is: "Whether mankind has free will is an
<EM>issue</EM>.  If it's something that doesn't work, it's a <EM>problem</EM>."

<P>An interesting possibility here is programming word-processors to catch a lot of
these things, since so many of them are set phrases that you almost never actually
want; and other things from the book are sort of "red flag" words that are often
(but not always) abused: "process", "issue", "unique", "revolutionary",
"visionary", etc.  Other things are a bit harder to get a computer to see -- like to
know that "broad overview" is redundant.

Ha!  I saw the same thing.  I was contemplating having him at OSCON as an interesting diversion, but he didn't seem entirely comfortable speaking.  Perhaps it was the cameras.<p>

He had great examples of horrendous twisting of the language: "concretize" was the one that stuck with me.  His point wasn't just that these sorts of neologisms are ugly, but that they're deliberately designed by advertisers, PR lackeys, and politicos to conceal the truth and inflate.</p><p>

An interesting twist on the same would be a "How to Lie with English" book, along the same lines as "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393310728" title="amazon.com">How to Lie with Statistics</a amazon.com>".</p><p>

<h2>PEEVE</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2002-05-21T00:27:31</h3>
<p>
I'm no big fan of "utilize", as it's nearly always clearer as "use".  My big peeve lately is "methodology".  Supposing we were to study ways of developing software, would we call it "methodologyology"?</p>



<h2>Yes, but</h2>

<p>... the other Perl programmer at work keeps telling me that I have "issues."<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>



<h2>Politics and the English Language</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/quidity/">quidity</a> on 2002-05-21T16:38:49</h3>
<p>George Orwell wrote a good essay on this, <a href="http://www.resort.com/user/prime8/Orwell/patee.html" title="resort.com">Politics and the English Language</a resort.com>, two bits of which I liked in particular:</p>

<p> <i>It is easier -- even quicker, once you have the habit -- to say
"In my opinion it is not an unjustifiable assumption that"
than to say "I think".</i> </p>

<p>And this set of rules for writing well:</p>

<ol> <li>
Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used
to seeing in print.</li>
<li>Never us a long word where a short one will do.</li>
<li>If it is possible to cut a word out,  always cut it out.</li>
<li>Never use the passive where you can use the active.</li>
<li>Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can
think of an everyday English equivalent.</li>
<li>Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.</li>
</ol>

Strunk and White, "The Elements of Style". Good book to live by.<br> <br>They even had your rule 3 as a rule. "Omit needless words."

Indeed.
<p>There is even a (cookie free) <a href="http://sut1.sut.ac.th/strunk/" title="sut.ac.th">online version</a sut.ac.th>, although<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.th is Thailand, if I'm not mistaken. Otherwise there's <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/141/" title="bartleby.com">this version</a bartleby.com> but it wants a cookie.</p>

<p>Yep. However, do note that the current edition
is the 4th edition, and what those sites have is
the first. The 4th is somewhat more modern (it
mentions computery stuff, but doesn't offer an
opinion on terms such as email).</p> <p>It's
usually best to have some form of modern style
