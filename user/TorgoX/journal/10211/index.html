<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;[...]
The BMI (body mass index) of adopted children
usually correlates nicely with that of their biological parents, but not with that of
their adoptive parents. This strongly suggests that genetics, not "psychology", play the
larger role in human obesity. Leibel began a painstaking search for the elusive satiety
factor in the adipose tissue of normal mice. 
<p>Generally, scientists agree that metabolic rate is a very poor predictor of
obesity, but what is almost certainly a potent factor is "non-exercise activity
thermogenesis", or Neat. Neat is what most of us think of as nervous energy - the
fidgeting, restless pacing, maintenance of posture and other subliminal activities of
daily life. For reasons not yet understood, some people sharply increase these
unconscious exertions in response to overeating. James Levine, an endocrinologist at
the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, conducted a study in which 16 volunteers (including
Levine himself) were overfed 1,000 calories a day for two months. On average, the
volunteers gained 10lbs. But, as is often the case, the average was not particularly
revealing. One subject gained only 2lbs, while another gained 16lbs. Levine sorted
through a range of factors and concluded that differences in Neat levels accounted for
a tenfold difference in fat storage among the volunteers.[...]&raquo;<p

Don't you know that obesity is caused by McDonalds? I swear, until the recent court case I thought the Big Mac extra value meal was good for me!
