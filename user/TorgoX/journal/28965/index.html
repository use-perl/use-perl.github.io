<p><p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;I could have written a book about what a dick John Stossel is, but it
turns out he already did. In 2004, Stossel published a book,
christened compositely with hubris and persecution mania: <cite>Give Me a
Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became
the Scourge of the Liberal Media.</cite> In it, Stossel gloats about building
a waterfront home and profiting from government subsidy under the
National Flood Insurance Program. "Subsidized insurance goes to
movie stars in Malibu, to rich people in Kennebunkport (where the Bush
family has its vacation compound), to rich people in Hyannis (where
the Kennedy family has its), and to all sorts of people like me who
ought to be paying our own way." Ought to, yes, but like a great
many things, that also isn't John Stossel's problem. After a
flood, he writes, "the government bought me a new first
floor." And later when the house was wiped out completely,
"financially I made out just fine. You paid for the
house--and its contents. I'm not proud that I took your
money, but if the government is foolish enough to offer me a special
deal, I'd be foolish not to take it." Feckless bureaucracy
isn't merely his favorite bugbear--it's his cash
cow.&raquo;<blockquote

John Stossel' Great Invisible Handjob"</a></blockquote></blockquote>

So this is the lesson: code is not self-documenting.  Idiocy, however, is.
