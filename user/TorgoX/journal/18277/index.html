<p>Dear Log,
<p>So.  The <cite>New York Times</cite>, our national paper of record
for Manhattan, just did a front-page story on the Southeast Alaskan town I live in,
<a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-03-25/abandoned_hotel.jpg">Ketchikan</a>.

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/10/national/10ALAS.html">Here's the article</a>.
If it prompts you to log in, use "genital"/"genital".
<p>To say that the article has glaring, basic, factual errors would be so <em>kind</em> to the NYT
that it would verge on sycophancy.  I will merely illustrate using the biiiiig pretty picture that leads the
article.  The caption says "tiny Ketchikan, in foreground, would be linked by a bridge to a mountainous
island a mile away".  Guess what.  That's not a picture of Ketchikan.  It's about an hour's hike from anywhere in Ketchikan (with serious hiking gear), and pointing toward Pennock Island.
It's like taking a picture of a gas station on Catalina and adding the caption "Hollywood, mecca of the entertainment industry...".
<p>But there is one actual fact in the article tho: the bridge plan is a waste of money.  In fact, it is a waste of money
so appalling that it suffocates the mind.
<p>The cost estimate that appears in the article is: $200 million dollars.  Of US federal tax money.
<p>If built, the bridge will be immense, like the Eiffel Tower dropped sideways across the beautiful
<a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-03-25_floats/overcast_narrows.jpg">Tongass Narrows</a>.
It will be a marine navigation hazard and an irreparable ecological disaster.  Its construction and effects will totally and permanently collapse the local economy.  I am not exaggerating when I say that this project is as ludicrous and inefficient a use of money as if the federal government simply bought every adult in Ketchikan a Jaguar sports car, or simply bombed the whole town to rubble and rebuilt it from scratch for free.
<p>I'm going to write to <a href="http://www.house.gov/donyoung/">the congressman</a> responsible.  Let's see if I can avoid using the words "you gibbering halfwit" in my message to him.</p>

I think the ideal effect I'm looking for is to make the staffer who's reading the letter get up and stab the Congressman in question.
