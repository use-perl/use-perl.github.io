<p>Dear Log,
<blockquote>&laquo;McMichael and his team have taken an entirely different road, inspired by the
discovery of prostitutes in Kenya who remained HIV-negative in spite of frequent sex
with infected men. The Kenyan women were remarkable not for their antibodies but
for the high levels of what are known as killer T-cells - those white blood cells that
divide and attack other cells that have been invaded by a virus. The Oxford vaccine,
now in trials there, in London and in Nairobi, uses DNA to trigger a strong killer cell
response. The results in mice have been good. Now the vaccine is being tested in
healthy people with no likelihood of exposure to HIV. In two to three years, it could
face the crunch test in people at risk. "It will be about five to six years before we know
if it works," says McMichael.&raquo;<p

<h2>Eerie Coincidences</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2002-08-03T20:23:52</h3>
It's eerie how closely this news story matches the plot of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553373994" title="amazon.com">a novella</a amazon.com> written by Norman Spinrad in the early years of the AIDS epidemic.  His story is so obviously about AIDS, even though he never mentions the name of this disease.  Somehow, Spinrad manages to be both politically correct and salacious at the same time.  (All in all, it's no great shame that the book is out of print...) <p> The gist of the story is that the epidemic began to fade once a mutant strain of the virus developed in a prostitute; it was both more virulent (killing other strains of the virus) and didn't cause any symptoms whatsoever in the host.</p>
