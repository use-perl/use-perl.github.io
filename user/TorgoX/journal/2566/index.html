<p>Dear Log,
<p>I forgot to make my Paxil for a few hours yesterday, and was
<a href="http://www.unadog.com/pics/fifteen-weeks/tn/milo_loves_una.jpg.html
">a bit on-edge.</a>  It was an amusing and brief reversion to my pre-Paxil brain chemistry:
<p>"Torgo, there's voicemail."
<br>"I KNOW.  It's so funny that you think I wouldn't KNOW that!"
<br>"What?"
<br>"I heard the click from the computer when you went to log in just now and that click means there's no dailtone so there must be voicemail, so you don't HAVE TO TELL ME there's voicemail because it's as clear as day that there's a voicemail message that way.  So obviously TELLING me is just obviously REDUNDANT, OBVIOUSLY!  I heard the click, and you could ASSUME I heard the click, so you know, and I know, and you know I know, RECURSIVELY, and so it's REDUNDANT, CLEAR AS DAY, clear as... as DAYLIGHT!  Clear as daylight, like the BRIGHT SUN OUTSIDE there, outside... outside... hm, I should take a walk maybe, maybe a walk would be nice, and if I took a walk I would need my shoes.  So WHERE ARE MY SHOES?  Why do you ASSUME I would know where my shoes are!?!  Or that I don't need them?!  I can't go outside in my SOCK FEET, OBVIOUSLY!  DAMMIT.  No.  No, I'll just STAY INSIDE and WRITE EMAIL.  I have MANY ANGRY THINGS TO SAY IN EMAIL RIGHT NOW."

<p>So I then remembered to take the pill and I was muuuch better.  It's very unproductive and tiring being wound up like that.
<br>Hijinx ensue.
<br>Next episode: Me and Ethel get a job in a candy factory!

Sounds like the title of a weblog by George Costanza's father.  "I've got MANY ANGRY THINGS to tell people!  I'm VERY unhappy with all of you!"

Yes, without daily correction of my brain chemistry, every day is Festivus -- except that besides just the Airing of Grievances, there is also the Clenching of Jaw Muscles, and every once in a while the Freaking Out About Anything.  Thank God I wasn't born too early to have access to decent drugs like this, or I'd probably have self-medicated with something a bit less tidy, like three shots of whiskey before breakfast, plus enough pot to make me forget my own name.
<p>Neurochemistry may sound simple, but don't try this at home, kids -- only under hip-hop supervision!</p>
