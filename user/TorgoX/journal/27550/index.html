<p>Dear (bogb)log,
<p>After I finished two CDROM releases yesterday, I went back to
trying to clear the swales in the back yard today.  This time, I went
higher up in the yard and found yet more trouble -- one culvert
empties into the swale which then leads to another culvert; but that
along the way, the swale is blocked by a tree and its roots, by some
variously nefarious grasses, and by the edge of a pile of discarded
lumber that has sunken into the muskeg and thus become slimy and
water-heavy.  Yay for bogs!

<p>I went to work with a hatchet and a shovel,  and I managed to clear the
blockages passably well.  All this stomping around in the muskeg makes
for a real mess -- just stepping on the ground smashes the pretty grass
and reveals the angrily oozing mud underneath; and my
shovel-and-hatchet work leaves blobs of grimy straw, dead roots, and
lumber bits everywhere.

<p>Apparently draining muskeg at anything other than an industrial
scale is very much a study in "it has to get worse before it'll get
better".  But in spite of the ugliness, there was a surprisingly
immediate payoff: the goo started to drain right away, shedding maybe
a dozen liters a minute, it looked like.

<p>To parallel Freud: the purpose of this drainage is to transform boggy necrosis into ordinary muddiness.</p>
