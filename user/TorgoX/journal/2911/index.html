<p>Dear Log,
<p>&laquo;The whole point of brand names
 these days is to disguise your purpose, not to clarify it. British Steel is now Corus, British Gas is Centrica,
 Tarmac Construction is Carillion, the Conservative party is New Labour.
[...]

<p>Of course modern global companies can't have names that really reflect their purpose, because the honesty
 would be too damaging: Rip U Off, Asset-strip PLC, Kwik-Profitz and I Can't Believe We're Not Better. And so
 they have quasi-Latin names that are deliberately bland and meaningless in the hope that nobody will take
 offence at what they actually do. The fashion is spreading fast; the al-Qaida terrorist network is soon to be
 renamed Convexia and the LA street gang the Bloods will henceforth be known as Cruxelsior PLC.&raquo;

Hm, interesting post.
<br>
<br>I was surprised when I followed a link to www.goto.com and was told that "Goto is now Overture" -- I thought, *why*?
<br>
<br>AC is now Accenture (sorry, can't spell that properly because it's supposed to have a &gt; sign about the T, they probably got consulting from TAFKAP on how to get "name branding" in a way that's impossible to represent in ASCII), etc. ad nauseam.
