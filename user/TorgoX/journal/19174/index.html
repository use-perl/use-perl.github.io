<p>Dear Log,
<p>Amid all the Gippershmerts of the past few days,
we should not <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/user/myl/languagelog/archives/001036.html">forget</a>
that today is the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the end of the McCarthyist witchhunts -- which a histrionic and delusional actor named Ronald Reagan had so gleefully been helping out in his... I almost said "youth", but he was almost 40 even then.</p>

Nowhere in that article is Reagan mentioned.  You may be (and prolly are) right, but you just couldn't resist some slander against all the positive (and conservative) press (Gippershmerts ?).  Or are you saying that Reagan gleefully helped bring the end of the witchhunts?<br> <br>I guess I'm a little provoked when people speak bad of the dead.  I hope the word "Lewinsky" doesn't come out of my mouth when President Clinton passes away.<br> <br>Peace,<br> <br>Jason

<p>What does it matter either way?</p>

<h2>What Sean may be referring to somewhat obliquely..</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/clintp/">clintp</a> on 2004-06-10T13:45:55</h3>
Reagan appeared as a "friendly witness" in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee, led .  [I don't have a direct source, so no cite or year.]
<p>
This would not have been out of character.  As a staunch anti-communist and the president of the Screen Actors Guild (1947-1952, 1959-1960) it would have been unusual for him not to appear before the Committee.</p>

Reagan was an FBI informant as well while he was president of the SAG. See <a href="http://www.quickchange.com/reagan/1985.html" title="quickchange.com">this</a quickchange.com> - it was confirmed by the White House in 1985.

What seems to be lost in this is that while Reagan did tell the FBI what he knew about communist activities, he refused to name names.<br> <br>It sounds to me like he did an excellent thing, in an excellent way.  Communism was a serious threat, and like all serious threats, our government overreacted to it.  Reagan did what was right to help protect against the threat, and had the courage and discernment to not cross the line into what was wrong.
