<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>
&laquo;As Colvig noticed during his years in southern Oregon, many variations
of the basic story were circulated, although the essential details
remained fairly uniform. Ms. Ella Clark, in a discussion of the
relationship between Indian mythology and
<a href="http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/north_america/crater_lake.html">actual geological occurrences,</a>
debated whether or not Colvig's notes on the myth (recorded in 1892
after his earlier notes were lost) might have been influenced by new
geological evidence on Mount Mazama's eruption. She determined, however,
that they probably had not been, for several reasons. First, no detailed
theory on the formation of the caldera was published until 1897; second,
Colvig was known to have related the myth to his children several times
after he first heard it and was also known to possess a remarkable
memory; and third, it does conform with the Klamath Indian belief in a
large number of nature spirits and with Indian explanations of eruptions
of other volcanic peaks.&raquo;

And that was seven thousand years ago, folks.</p>
