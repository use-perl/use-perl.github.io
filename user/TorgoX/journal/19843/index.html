<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;Mexico's attorney general and other senior staff have had computer chips implanted in their arms to serve both as an identity device and a tracking mechanism should they be kidnapped.
<p>Rafael Macedo de la Concha said similar non-removable chips had been inserted under the skin of senior staff in his office and the 160 employees of a new state-of-the-art crime database.
<p>The attorney general did not seem particularly concerned about getting his arm chopped off in consequence, perhaps because he already believes he is risking his life.&raquo;

I don't like Mexico anymore!!</p>

I don't think Serious Kidnappers will have any problem of scanning (or simply feeling) for the chip and, ahem, extracting it.<br>

True, but does this chip really do any tracking anyway? Something designed to control access to a building (and scanned from a distance of a few feet at most) is not going to be powered and broadcasting a signal that can be picked up by satellites. And if it is powered, where does the power come from?<br> <br>Sounds like the Mexicans have been scammed by <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/09/02/cap_cyborg_to_chip/" title="theregister.co.uk">Captain Cyborg</a theregister.co.uk>.

Easy way to show they've got the victim -- send the RFID chip back in the mail.
