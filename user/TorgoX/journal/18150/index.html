<p><b>First, we kill all the fact checkers</b>
<p>by Florence King

<P>Ask any randomly chosen group of writers for a list of their pet
peeves and you will get remarkably similar replies.  No matter
how different we are in literary style and philosophy, we all tend
to bear the same crosses in the everyday business of writing and
publishing.

<P>My own list of pet peeves begins with fact checkers.  These are the
people who write <i>source?</i> beside sentences like "Joan Fontaine
starred in <i>Letter from an Unknown Woman</i> in 1948."  Source?  I
remember it, dammit.  I was twelve when it came out and I saw it. 
But that's not good enough; fact checkers are frequently sweet
young things just out of college and the dew is still on the
footnote.  They won't believe you until you copy the proper page
from <i>Popcorn Venus</i> and fax it to them.  You emerge from these
frays feeling that your word has been doubted and that you have
been suspected of senility - which fact checkers always change to
Alzheimer's.

<P>Sometimes their political correctness is downright scary,
especially when the don't even bother to consult with the writer
and simply go ahead and change something.  I recently wrote a
piece for the <i>Los Angeles Times Magazine</i> in which I referred to Belle
Watling, the madam in <i>Gone With The Wind</i>.  When I got the galleys, my
correct spelling had been changed to "Bell."  I called and spoke to one of the
editors who rather nervously explained, "They said that was right."

<P>Who was this sinister "they" and what was going on?  How could anybody
reference GWTW and come up with Bell for Belle?  After giving it some
thought I was pretty sure I knew what had happened.  In <i>Roots</i> Kunte
Kinte's wife is named Bell, and currently a black feminist scholar named
Bell Hooks is making news.  I suspect that some fact checkereither made a
fashionable but honest mistake - or worse, decided that Belle "ought" to be
Bell in the name of spelling reparations.

<P>I copied a page from GWTW on which Belle is mentioned several times and
faxed it to L.A.  The name appeared correctly in the published article but the
whole needless episode was one of nervewracking alarm for me.

<P>Even when there is no question of ulterior motives or political agendas, the
average fact checker is maddeningly literal-minded.  They don't catch jokes,
particularly puns, so I end up <i>explaining</i> why something is funny.  They also
tend to ask for surnames of people who don't use surnames ("Anastasia
Who?"). Above all, they love to wreck historical anecdotes by inserting
needless documentation: "Caroline of Brunswick (1768-1821) boasted that
she changed her underdrawers once a year whether they were dirty or not."

<P>Even good fact checkers drive writers to distraction.  When James M. Cain
was asked to write for the <i>New Yorker</i>, where the legendary Mrs. White
thought nothing of attaching sixty or seventy flags to the average article, he
replied, "On the whole, I'd rather be dead."

<P>The time-honored literary conventions of artistic license and suspension of
disbelief are anathema to fact checkers, probably because these conventions
contain the seeds of their own unemployment.  James M. Cain ran into this
mindset when he wrote <i>Galatea</i>, a novel about the love affair between and
enormously fat woman and a fight trainer who knows how to get weigh off
boxers.

<P>When the trainer goes into the woman's bathroom, he finds two sets of
scales.  Reflecting that the average bathroom scale goes only up to two
hundred pounds, he concludes that she must weigh herself with a foot on
each scale, which would put her weigh somewhere between three and four
hundred pounds.

<P>The reader accepts this because Cain deftly plays on the universal human
fascination with the grotesque to make us suspend our disbelief - we want
to believe it, and so we do.  We know from the title that the trainer is going
to slim the woman down and fall in love with her, so the fatter she is, the
better the plot.  We don't <i>care</i> about the details; as long as the author gives
us a good story we will grant him the right of artistic license.

<P>But fact checkers don't think this way.  Cain found himself buried under a
blizzard of challenges that could occur only to a mind locked in tunnel
vision:

<p>"Possible to get accurate weight using two scales at once?"
<p>"Druggist supply-house catalog lists models up to 250 pounds."
<p>"How does she see dial?  Magnified?  Pls. specify."
<p>"Suggest change to hospital scale."

<P>The best fact-checker story I ever heard concerns a woman who worked at
<i>Harper's</i> twenty years ago.  One very minor point in an article about Ralph
Nader had eluded her, and she just couldn't stand it.  Although they were
already late going to press, she did everything short of holding the
production staff up at gunpoint while she ransacked the entire country to
find out the color of Nader's briefcase.

<P>The author had said it was black but a little voice in her steel-trap mind said
brown.  Unable to get hold of Nader herself, she called everybody who might
know him well, including the FBI, until at last she found an alienated hippie
who had been one of the original "Nader's Raiders."

<P>Ralph's briefcase?  Sure, he remembered.  It was brown.

<li>Who is this <em>Florence King</em>?</li>

<li>Are your sure her first name isn't Florance?</li>
<li>There is no annotation for the 1977 TV miniseries
<em>Roots</em> which was an adaptation of Alex Haley's novel of the same name that followed the emancipation of the slave Kunta Kinte.</li>
<li>Without citation, the closing ancedote about the Harper's factchecker devolves into apocrypha.</li>

"factchecker" is, in fact, two words...<br>

It's funny that she should bring up the New Yorker.<br/><br/>My brief moment of fame was many years ago when a piece in Talk of the Town referred to me as "perhaps the Monty Python scholar in America today".  This stemmed from my taking notes at an extensive Python screening at the Museum of Broadcasting.<br/><br/>I got a call from a fact checker asking, in part, if I had been using a yellow legal pad.  I figured it was an odd question, but I answered that, no, it was in fact a <em>white</em> legal pad.<br/><br/>Despite bothering to ask, the published piece got it wrong.

They were apparently trying to ensure it was <em>wrong</em>.  That's what happens when fact checkers are used for evil.
