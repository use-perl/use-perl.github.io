<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;But some said the public document, distributed Sept. 23, provides a
window into the priorities of some [Charles County
school] board members.

<p>One entry calls for inviting Gideons International to distribute Bibles
to students.  Another reads: "Science: Do not use books biased towards
evolution (10th grade biology)." It recommends that texts and videos
espousing the theory of creationism be provided to students. The list
includes recommendations that sex education classes teach abstinence
only and "a pro-life approach throughout the school system." Another
suggests deleting from reading lists any books that offer a "neutral or
positive view of immorality or foul language."&raquo;
<p>--<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A2236-2004Oct2.html?sub=AR">Religion Colors Goals for Schools</a>: Giving Out Bibles Among Suggestions</blockquote>

<p>Yes yes, we need to give <em>equal time</em> to evolution <em>and</em>
to the theory that the Universe was created twenty years ago by Wonder Woman.
<p>And therein, a microcosm of thought in the US.
  Dualism on the one hand and dualism on the other.</p>

You're a red state, but not like the rest. Is it Bible country?<br> <br>If it's like Canada's north, you have a fair number of ex-cons fleeing the contiguous USA. I wonder if that helps or hurts in becoming more tolerant.

It sounds facile and silly for me to say it this way, but I swear it's true: I can think of no better description of Southeast Alaska other than that it's just like <cite>Twin Peaks.</cite>  That's what it's like.

The whole Northwest is just like Twin Peaks which is why I loved that show after having lived there even briefly. I think David Lynch crafted that show not as a parody but as a cultural study.

I got the same impression -- I was at a conference in a small BC town in 1990, when Twin Peaks was still on.<br> <br>And they also served DONUTS at this conference! Spooky.

<h2>Was it just me...</h2>

Was I the only one, or did the notion of the Universe being created 20 years ago by Wonder Woman suddenly give justice to the fact that I worshipped Linda Carter around then?

BLASF33M0R!  It is spelled <a href="http://members.tripod.com/user/connollys/" title="tripod.com">LYNDA CARTER</a tripod.com>!
<p>Digression: I always thought her high cheekbones made her look part Cherokee or Lakota.  And now I look <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0004812/bio" title="imdb.com">here</a imdb.com> and see that she's part Mexican, which in turn usually equals part Native-American-from-South-Of-The-Border.</p>
