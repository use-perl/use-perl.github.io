<p>Dear Log,
<p>Didn't sleep right all night, and so was bleary all day today.
I didn't want to go back to sleep; and if I just went and read
I knew I'd fall asleep.  I wasn't alert enough to program.
I had a stroke of brilliance: rake the leaves out in the yard!

<p>So, in a feat of inertia-less-ness, that's what I did. Eight bags of
leaves/straw later, the yard looks not quite so shabby.

<p>Tomorrow maybe I'll be coherent enough to put out a new Pod::Simple.
I still have to decide whether/how to allow a patch that would provide
on option for refraining from collapsing whitespace in Pod paragraphs,
and also whether/how to allow a patch to provide on option for turning
punctuation-space-space sequences into
punctuation-nonbreakingspace-space (before collapsing all whitespace
sequences, where nonbreakingspace doesn't count as whitespace).  Both are attempts to come at the problem of treating Pod source like:

<p><code>And I saw the pie.&nbsp;&nbsp;I ate it until it was gone.</code></p>

<p>Note the two spaces after "pie." and before "I ate".  Personally I'd like if formatters would keep that extra space, but I think it's just one of those typographic distinctions, like the eight (or whatever) kinds of dashes, that just isn't going to last, and which, all things considered, probably isn't worth the bother at this point.  But one of the formatter authors is making a stink about how I need to support this, so I am in the odd position of being extremely hesitant to support something that he and I both want.  Maybe I'll just add it and put many dire caveats in the docs.</p>
