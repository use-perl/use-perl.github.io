a long time for it to shut down? Or, if the general case is too hard to answer,
then I'll ask specifically: Can anyone explain to me why it takes so long for
MSWindows to boot? I mean, I realize that there's lots of device drivers to

takes for any other large program, like MSWord?</span></p><br/><br/><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt'>And especially for shutdown:

<h2>LAG</h2>

Do you remember <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>, where the bad guys finally find the Ark of the Covenent and open it, releasing all sorts of strange spirits?  It takes a while.  Of course, shutting down means stuffing them all back in the box.
</p> <p>
I would have used the "genie back in the bottle" image, but then I wouldn't be able to make a <a href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/2F09" title="snpp.com">Stonecutter's Guild</a snpp.com> reference.</p>



<h2>Shutdown</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Odud/">Odud</a> on 2002-05-01T08:16:11</h3>
From a position of no knowledge - I feel that the slowness comes when things are being done to the registry. However it is difficult to see why the shutdown of a machine that has no applications running should take so long as surely everything has been flushed to the disk.<br> <br>If you are logged in to a domain controller then as you log out I think it writes your local profile back to the domain controller and this seems to slow things down also.



<h2>Services</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2002-05-01T13:01:20</h3>
I find that startup is largely based on the number of services that you run at startup.  When you shut down, the OS is going to shut down all of those services as well.  Mostly I'm talking about stuff running in the background, not active applications.
<p>
For the record (lino-nuts of the world), my Linux partition has about the same boot time as my Windows 98 partition.  There are some free startup managers for Windows that can help you remove some junk (that doesn't appear in the startup folder) to help your boot time as well.
</p><p>
The quickest OS for boot time that I've seen is BeOS, at @15 seconds from boot sector to music. Shutdown is generally about 2 seconds, or you can just hit the power button (journaled OS ya know).</p>

Yep.  When I was running BeOS on my desktop, the longest part of the boot sequence was waiting for the hardware initialization (POST, BIOS displays, finding the graphics card and turning it on, etc.).  From hitting the boot sector to a usable desktop took 10-12 seconds on my dual-Celeron 400 config.  That whole damn system is so responsive, it's sheer existance contradicts Joel Spolsky's assertion that "software should never be rewritten".<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
My guess is that the Befolk were <b>very</b> good at cuttting corners or deferring perceived boot time.  No one (save Palm, and other embedded system designers) seems to be too concerned about this.
</p><p>
Why does Winders take so long?  If you look at billg's testimony, Windows isn't as much about providing a clean platform that developers can build upon as much as it's about providing a large set of backward-compatibility APIs developers are familiar with.  Presumably similar arguments can be made for MacOS[X].
</p><p>
Hardware and drivers <i>are</i> an issue in boot time.  I swapped out my CD-R last year, and now FreeBSD takes an extra 10-20 seconds to boot when it's starting the IDE controller.  There's probably a wonky timeout issue somewhere, probably because something isn't terminated properly.</p>
