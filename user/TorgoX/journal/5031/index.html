<p>Dear Log and Everyone,
<p>Is there a way to turn off the <a href="http://members.spinn.net/user/sburke/upo_footer.gif">noisy footer</a> at the bottom of all use.perl.org pages?
<p>I mean, the "[ FAQ | About | Submit Story | Older Stories | Topics | Polls | Journals | Authors | Preferences | Logout ]" line is fine by me; but the white box and the copyright notice over that are just so much noise.</p>

Certainly, the copyright notice is not going away.  That's kinda important.<br> <br>As to the other, I dunno, I just have more important things to do, but if you send me email, I can come back to it some rainy day.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>What I should do is put the site templates on public CVS and allow people to submit patches<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>

<p>Just because it's important doesn't mean that every user should have to see it on every page every time.
</p><p>I mean "Don't forget your keys" is an important concept, but that doesn't mean I've markered it on the inside of my glasses.</p>

Yes, but just because you don't like it, and don't think it is necessary, doesn't mean it shouldn't be there, or that it isn't.

<em>Yes, but just because you don't like it, and don't think it is necessary, doesn't
   mean it shouldn't be there, or that it isn't.</em>
<p>So are you implicating that it does have to be on every page, for every viewer, all the time?</p>

No.  I am not saying anything about where it has to be.  I am saying I am going to put it in the standard footer and leave it there, and won't add code to allow it to be disabled.
