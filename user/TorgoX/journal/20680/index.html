<p>Dear Log,
<p>So I go into a liquor store here <a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-06-13_postcards/puffin1">in town</a>, a decent store in fact, and I poked around and found the Pernod!  Yay!
But ugh, it was like $40 a bottle! I remember when it was half that!  So as I'm checking out, I say jovially
to the clerk, who I think was the owner, "man, forty dollars!
The dollar must be in the <em>toilet,</em> all the imported stuff is so expensive now!".

<p>And he replied pleasantly "yeah, and prices on imports were actually going up even before
the dollar started to dive".

<p>And then he got this totally insane snarling expression on his face and sort of stared into space
and practically yelled "they think their <em>foreign</em> stuff is 
<em>so</em> much <em>better</em> than things from the U.S.!!".

<p>My crazy-detector went from 0% to 80% instantly, and I said "mm quite hm" and skittered away.  (On the way out,
I thought, what, so I'm buying Pernod but spurning all the domestic pastisses?  All <em>zero</em>
of them?)

<p>Then I come home and read, in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">the paper</a>, the comments of a Southern Senator speaking at the GOP convention:
<blockquote>&laquo;"If [the US Democratic Party] is a national party, sushi is our national dish. If this is a national party, surfing has become our national pastime," he argues. "The modern south and rural America are as foreign to our Democratic leaders as some place in Asia or Africa."&raquo;
<p>--<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1294695,00.html">"Zigzag
Democrat cheers on Bush"</a></blockquote>

<p>And I think, is today <a href="http://www.resistance.com/">Freak</a>-ass <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/onthemedia/transcripts/transcripts_081304_flock.html">Xenophobia</a> Day?

I mean, I know the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679748199/">arguments</a>
of how <a href="http://www.themodernword.com/eco/eco_blackshirt.html">the
components of fascism</a>
are an unavoidable part of democracy, but all it still makes me <a href="http://www.dissidentvoice.org/June04/Frank0614.htm">grind my teeth</a>.

<p>Meanwhile, from that same article:
"Mr Miller's response is that it is not he who abandoned the Democrats but the Democrats who abandoned America's south and its conservative principles".  Is that such a bad thing?  As far as I can tell, the world
can learn a lot from the South -- but only by <em>negative</em> example.

<p>(Nota bene: actually, it turns out that there is a US source for pastis:
<a href="http://www.charbay.com/pastis.asp">Charbay</a> in California.
At $60 a bottle!  Hooboy!)

<p>(Nota bene etiam: about my crazy-o-meter: 100% is <a href="http://www.bipm.fr/en/scientific/mass/prototype.html">calibrated</a> at: homeless cannibal nudist street preacher on public access cable TV.)</p>
