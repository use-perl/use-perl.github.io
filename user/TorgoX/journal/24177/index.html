<p>Dear Log,

<p>The Weak Schroedinger's Google hypothesis:
<blockquote>If you don't look for a
tool/utility in Google, it is there.  (But if you do look, it may or
may not be there.)</blockquote>

<p>The Strong Schroedinger's Google hypothesis:
<blockquote>IFF you don't look for
a tool/utility in Google, it is there.  (And if you <em>do</em> look,
it's <em>not</em> there.)</blockquote>

<p>The Dammit Schroedinger's Google hypothesis:
<blockquote>If you look
for it in Google, it <em>is</em> there, but mysteriously you
<em>won't</em> find it until you later have to go create the tool for
yourself -- at which point you can immediately google for it again and
then actually the stuff that would have saved you all that time if
you'd found it the first time.</blockquote>

<h2>The Coraline Corollary</h2>

...but if you ask Richard to Google for it, he will find it.

This is true.  He's amazing!

<h2>Clinton's Rationale....</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/clintp/">clintp</a> on 2005-04-14T13:21:50</h3>
Clinton's Rationale for the The Dammit Schroedinger's Google Hypothesis:<br> <br>By the time you've learned enough about a topic to begin programming, you now have the correct keywords you need to search on Google for the ready-made solution.<br> <br>Corollary:<br>This moment is also the time that you determine that the ready-made solutions weren't adaquate anyway.<br> <br>Corollary 2:<br>The amount of work done after the discovery in Corollary 1, but before you realize that you shouldn't have re-invented this wheel will always be just enough investment that you'll keep working on it anyway.



<h2>And don't forget Finagle's Law[*]</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Fletch/">Fletch</a> on 2005-04-14T15:52:23</h3>
<p>
If you search and <em>don't</em> find it, asking in public (IRC, Perlmonks, <i>et al</i>) will almost certainly guarantee it being the first hit when you add one more blindingly obvious search term that everyone will sugguest.
