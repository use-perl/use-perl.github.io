<p>Dear Log,
<p>XML::Parser hasn't had a release since 2.30, in October 2000.
Why nothing since?  Don't tell me it doesn't have any bugs!
Or that something as important as XML::Parsers isn't
being maintained!</p>

I think it might have something to do with the fact that Clark Cooper has all but disappeared from the face of the planet Earth (a la Enno Derksen of XML::Checker fame).  The same issue was raised on the perl-xml mailing list recently.  Some guy called Matt Sergeant (whoever he is - grin) made an offer to maintain it.<br> <br>I think many of the perl-xml hackers have their attention focused on more "sexy" modules (XML::SAX* or XML::LibXML etc) and XML::Parser has been somewhat forgotten about.

Wow, synchronicity!  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=XML-Parser" title="cpan.org">XML-Parser</a cpan.org> 2.31 was released earlier today!

  Yup, all of the above is correct, and also XML::Parser is not all that important, it's on the deprecation slope. As soon as the XS version of XML::SAX::Expat is finished, it'll clearly belong to another age of XML programming. If you write anything now, I'd strongly advise against using XML::Parser directly.

Well, if a neophyte were looking in CPAN for an XML parser, he would pick something called "XML::Parser" anyday, over something with the indecypherable name "XML::Sax::Expat".  And if he looks at XML::Parser and sees something that doesn't really work, or is just a heap of cruft, that makes all of Perldom look bad.

  Yes I know, but what can we do about that? XML::Parser will work, albeit with an awfully old interface, and some of the modern XML stuff missing.
</p>

<p>
  A newbie coming from another language (ie knowing XML but not Perl) will most likely look for SAX first however, which is already a good point.
</p>

<p>
  All that can be "fixed" in documentation because I don't think that we're going to pull XML::Parser and replace it with something that works differently.
</p>

<p>
  Anyway, the faq and site are coming together which ought to help, and I just received the O'Reilly Perl XML book source for translation into french so I guess it'll be on shelves pretty soon<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Personally I like XML::Parser.  It's what I'm used to, does everything I want, and doesn't give me a crufty feeling at all (not like, say, CGI.pm). *shrug*
