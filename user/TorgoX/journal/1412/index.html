<p>Dear log,
<p>Two weeks ago, I kvetched to my doctor about my, er, <em>overactive</em> brain chemistry, and she prescribed <a href="http://www.pslgroup.com/dg951121a.htm">paroxetine</a> ("Paxil"/"Seroxat").  I'm a week into the 20mg per day dose, and it's amazing the good that normal stable brain chemistry can do; I can actually think straight now, and relax; I'm even getting high scores at Tempest, <em>without</em> grinding my teeth.  And while Pod::* is still obviously appalling, I can imagine viable solutions which don't involve acid, lye, and having to dig graves in the desert.
<p>
I admit that I was apprehensive that the paroxetine would remove whatever drive compels me to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=author&query=SBURKE">write free software</a>, but I think that that was just an irrational application of the prevalent "crazed genius" clich&eacute;, the idea that to be clever, you have to be off-kilter -- at least being irresponsible, and at most being tormented and raving mad.  Of course, that's nonsense, both for art, and for programming.
<p>In fact, not only does individual cleverness not depend on being daffy (quite the contrary), but I think that collective cleverness  does not depend on individual cleverness.  While many people involved in Perl are brilliant, I think the goodness of the language comes not mainly from genius (any one grand epiphany of Larry's), but from the collective "scenius", as <a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/eno/eno_p2.html">Eno</a> called it ("scene" + "genius"), which we see as CPAN -- without which Perl would just be a (duly) glorified <a href="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=Icon">Icon</a>.
