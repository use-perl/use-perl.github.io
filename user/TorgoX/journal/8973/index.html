<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;[...]In the absence of any international inspection of Israel's nuclear capacity, Vanunu was our unofficial, DIY arms inspector. He is now held in Israel's highest security prison, having spent 12 of his last 16 years in solitary confinement. Neither the UN nor any individual member of the security council has questioned his imprisonment or demanded that Israel's nuclear capacity be opened to international inspection.
<p>[...]Yet Israel receives $3bn (ÃÂ£2bn) of aid, annually, from the US. This is despite legislation, the Symington Accord, to prevent US governments from granting aid to countries who develop nuclear weapons outside of international control and agreement.[...]&raquo;<p

So laws are selectively enforced.<p>Yup, pretty much.</p>

So what law was selectively enforced?<br> <br>Yup, none.<br> <br>Not even a principle is being selectively enforced.<br> <br> <ul> <li>Unlike Iraq, Israel has shown not one shred of aggression with its weapons of mass destruction.<br> <br></li> <li>Unlike Iraq, Israel has not started/lost a war where it was forced to comply with disarmament as terms of the loss.<br> <br></li> <li>Unlike the UN inspectors, this guy was not a UN inspector, and committed treason according to all possible interpretations of the law.  In any country, he would have been convicted of treason.<br></li> </ul> <br> <br>So where is the double standard?  Spell it our for me.  The only way I see to call it a double standard is to ignore the differentiating factors, which I can't see as reasonable.  The differentiating factors are the difference.

Sure sounds like a selective application of the Symington Accord, a.k.a. the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 to me!
<p> <em>The differentiating factors are the difference.</em>
<br>Exactly!  That's why the gubmint should stop calling these things "laws" and start calling them "demands we make of people we don't like this week".</p>

Oh, I didn't mean to imply it wasn't a violation of any particular laws, only that there is not here a double standard.  For it to be a double standard, we would have to apply the same standard differently to both.  But we don't.<br> <br>The standards applied to Iraq, mentioned in the previous post, do not apply to Israel, and we don't apply the Symington Accord or Nuclear Nonproliferation Prevention Act (I thought they were different things?) to Iraq, that I've ever seen.  Now, there is a double standard with Israel and other nations, such as North Korea and India, but not, from what I can tell, with Iraq.  Iraq is a unique case because it lost a war, it has used its weapons both inside and outside of its nation, etc.<br>

I&#8217;d be happy to spell it out to you.  Israel has showed aggression to every one of their neighbors continuously for the past 60 years and has attacked every one of their neighbors.<br/><br/>Israel has stated many wars, but has been protected by the USA.    President Bush seems to be so angry with Iraq for violating 17 U.N. Resolutions, but he does not seem to care how many U.N. Resolutions Israel violates (which is considerably more than all other nations on earth combined), including UN Security Council Resolution 487, of June 1981 which, &#8220;calls upon Israel urgently to place its nuclear facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.&#8221;<br/><br/>The truth hurts.  America wholeheartedly supports terrorism by Israel.  9-11 happened because of America&#8217;s fanatical support for the Israeli terrorists.  Israel was founded on terrorism and has employed terrorism as state policy consistently during its entire existence.<br/><br/>&#8220;Neither Jewish morality nor Jewish tradition can be used to disallow terror as a means of war... We are very far from any moral hesitations when concerned with the national struggle. First and foremost, terror is for us a part of the political war appropriate for the circumstances of today...&#8221; Yitzhak Shamir, former Israeli Prime Minister, Zionist terrorist in an August 1943 article titled &#8220;Terror&#8221;, written for Hazitthe journal of Lehi, the terrorist organization he belonged to.
Shamir and his fellow American sponsored terrorists have backed up their words with multiple actions by blowing up the King David Hotel, massacring the entire village of Deir Yassin, and well over 40 other substantially documented terrorist massacres that have continued to this very day.  The current Prime Minister of Israel, Ariel Sharon, is wanted for trial by a court in Brussels, Belgium for &#8220;Crimes against humanity&#8221; and other war crimes for his role in the Sabra and Shatila Refugee camp massacres in 1982.<br/><br/>There are those who say that we cannot control Israel.  I suggest that we can control them.  The next time the Israeli international war criminal (Sharon) comes to Washington to beg for more money, we should have a SWAT team nab him and send him to Brussels to face trial.  Secondly, we can urge our congressmen to obey U.S. law, specifically the Symington Accord, which strictly prohibits American financial or military aid from going to any country that develops nuclear weapons outside of international control and agreement.<br/><br/>It is a criminal offense in America to provide financing for terrorists, but the highly selective enforcement of this law depends upon the President&#8217;s definition of the word &#8220;is.&#8221;  The &#8220;World&#8217;s Policeman&#8221; seems to be a &#8220;dirty cop.&#8221;

I wouldn't know; I am incapable of reading what you wrote to find out of there is truth in it.  Try it again without the aluminum-foil hat stuff, and maybe there can be some actual dialogue.
