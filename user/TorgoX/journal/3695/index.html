<p>Dear Log,
<p>There's two questions I can't get anyone on <a href="http://www.vorbis.com/faq.psp">OGGland</a> to answer for me:
<p>What does "ogg" stand for?
<p>What's the official MIME type?
</p>

<a href="http://www.xiph.org/xiphname.html" title="xiph.org">This explanation</a xiph.org> is linked from the FAQ you pointed at, and it links to the Jargon File for <a href="http://info.astrian.net/jargon/terms/o/ogg.html" title="astrian.net">the original definition of "ogg"</a astrian.net>.  If there is an answer to what it stands for, that answer appears to be "Orion G".  Presumably you were hoping for something more satisfying or relevant, but after all "Perl" doesn't really stand for "Practical Extraction and Reporting Language" either.



<h2>OGG stands for..</h2>

What does 'OGG' stand for, if anything? When Paul was in high school, his school was connected to another school in the district. They all were timesharing at 300 baud with a Data General Nova 210. They used to program macros to send to each other things like a line of "Ni! Ni!..." (Monty Python, of course). One of the nonsense things they used to send was "Ogg, Ogg, Ogg...". It became an all-purpose expression. Whenever they had nothing better to do, or just wanted to comment on the mundanity of life, we would just send "Ogg..."<br/><br/>When Paul Parkhurst was thinking of a name, he just called himself the "Oggman". It stuck and he's always used that handle. In summary, "Ogg" stands for nothing in particular.<br/><br/>LINK: http://www.markshapiro.com/Issue3.html<br/><br/>There's one story, anyway!  Klicker
