<p><p>Dear Log,
<p>Man oh man, <a href=
 "http://interglacial.com/user/sburke/stuff/pretty_rss.html"
>XSLT</a> is a mess of a language.

<ul>
<li>It started out in a totally muddled Chang/Eng relationship with
XSLFO (which, to my mind, bears no more of an essential relationship
to XSLT than Perl does to RTF).
<li>Its first big implementation was by Microsoft, which was of course
a complete wreck.
<li>Design-wise, XSLT seems to have painted itself into so many corners
that it may thus have inadvertently proven that spacetime really does
have eleven dimensions.
<li>It is blessed/cursed by numerous vendor-specific extensions.
<li>It is caught between incredible tidal forces that on the one hand
want to "keep it simple" (so, variable use is crazily limited, almost
stifled; there's no proper looping constructs in the core language)
and on the other hand want it to be useful (templates/functions can be
recursive!).
<li>It may actually be the most visually unpleasant and verbose language <em>ever.</em>
<li>Its rule-based system is really hard to be completely comfortable with.
<li>There's no <em>particularly</em> good answer to the question "why
use XSLT instead of Perl (or any other language)?", other than that
it's <a href=
 "http://interglacial.com/user/sburke/stuff/pretty_rss.html"
>built into Firefox and MSIE</a> (<a href=
 "http://www.xml.com/pub/a/1999/05/xsl/xslconsidered_1.html?page=6"
 >although so is JavaScript</a>).
<li>I imagine that many applications embed it instead of JavaScript or
Lisp, for the reason that "well, XSL is not a <em>whole
language</em> like those others are"-- an argument whose speciousness
tarnishes everything it touches.
</ul>
<p>And yet, XSL is <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/xsltckbk/"
>just barely useful enough</a> that it won't go away any
time soon.  And like MSDOS .bat language, it's not awful at big dumb rudimntary tasks.

<p>And it's in that very odd class of things where you
have to admit "if we had it to design over again, it wouldn't look
anything like it does now; but since we're already this far into it,
I guess we might as well stick with it, ah well".  <p>And on the one hand, XSL
replaced something (<a href=
"http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/sun-info/standards/dsssl/stylesheets/html3_2/html32hc.dsl"
>DSSSL</a>) that was a thousand times more bizarre; but on the other, it's impossible to look at XSL and have the word "progress" come to mind.  Folks, the 8KB ROM BASICs from <em>thirty</em> years ago were better than this.
<p>And yet, and yet...  And yet, here it is, a testament to our inability to agree on anything better.
<p>XSL always reminds me of that quote of Hunter S. Thompson's:
"There he goes.  One of God's own prototypes.  Some kind of high
powered mutant never even considered for mass production. Too weird to
live, and too rare to die."
