How far was this crash from Annabelle's?  More importantly, is the restaurant OK?

No restaurants were harmed in the making of this crash.
<p>Other things very narrowly missed: the old folks' home ("Pioneers' home"), a diner, a hotel, a supermarket, and some houses, one of which houses The Big Friendly Dog That Patrols The Block.  And some people and stuff.</p>

Czech military jet would be flying over US airspace in a blizzard? I'm glad you're OK.<br/><br/>I do hope you ran out to the crash site with a shirt that said "Dude, I'm blogging this!"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Apparently once Jesus Pope Reagan forever won the War On Communism (Except For Our Friends In China), the Czechs just started selling these planes to anyone who wanted them.
<p>And so a "company in Las Vegas" bought one, and this supposedly involved a rich idiot who liked to just "take 'er out for a spin" every now and then.  Blah blah blah poor life choices blah blah blah Darwin, and BOOM.
</p><p>I was actually asleep when it went KBLOOMSKI; but the neighbors have been having some construction done, so I just sort of figured the sound was their builderslave dropping something, and I rolled over and went back to sleep; but then the very unusual and persistent sounds of a rescue helicopter buzzing the area (looking for the ejected pilot?) woke me right up.  Helicopters flying low are very rare here (no LAPD here!), much less one making the angry-engine sounds of having to fight to stay up in a blizzard.
</p><p>Still, the sheer nastiness of the blizzard kept me in the whole day.
</p><p>I went to the supermarket today, and the whole area behind the supermarket, where the crash happened, was cordoned off, with camo-suit guys running around.  And it smelled a bit of jet fuel.  And I couldn't take my usual stairstreet home, because apparently the bottom of it was pretty zorched from the crash!  And so it was all roped off.  <em>That</em> was weird.</p>
