<p>Dear Log,
<p><a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/user/esr/jargon/html/entry/Python.html">Yow!</a>
  Is he a <a href="http://tuxedo.org/user/esr/writings/sextips/">SENATOR</a> yet?
<blockquote>&laquo;Neither did we - we think - give the gift of hubris to open source
evangelist ERIC S RAYMOND, whose personal blog - "Armed And Dangerous" -
uses logic and free thought to reach the same certainties that sixteen
pints of "Ayn's Old Prejudicial" and a roomful of cab drivers might
manage in an evening. Previous heated debates in Eric's head have
included male homosexuality (they like little boys), the nature of Islam
("warlike and bloody", the lot of 'em), and dietary tips (meat and two
veg: it's evolution, mate). But only this week, Eric has invented a way
that Al-Qaeda could cripple America, sworn himself and his conspirators
to dread secrecy, then reassured the world that should bin Laden's
cronies try to torture him for his secrets, he will give them a "very
short education in what the wrath of Allah is really like". Next up:
following a politically motivated cop-shooting in California, Eric asks
when *is* it acceptable to gun down a police officer? When, he argues,
they come to round up all the guns, pornography, computers, or Jewish
people in your area. (We're guessing that should they come for the
homosexuals, Muslims, or non-Atkins dieters, get a second opinion before
opening fire.) Oh, we'd like to think that it's just one big troll, but
there's a real tone of desperate decline to it all. It's like watching
Larry Ellison channel Charlton Heston; it's like Cliff from "Cheers"
truly going postal; but most of all, it's like finally realising you no
longer have to defend Eric S Raymond to anyone any longer. And for that,
thanks for a true gift from God.
