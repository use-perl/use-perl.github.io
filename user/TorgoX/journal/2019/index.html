I particularly like the bit of the article that says <i>However, there has long been a sense that Mr Bush's respect for Pakistan has never   extended actually to knowing anything about the place</i>.  Sweet.<p>

Eh.  They don't know much about me, why should I care if my President knows much about them?

In theory, its part of his job description to know stuff about countries around the world, or at least give the appearance of knowing.
<br>
<br>You know, foreign affairs and all that.

Sure.  It makes him look bad to them.  I am just saying they don't know much about us, so it is hypocritcal for them to say he should know much about them.

If your president making an ignorant ass out of himself internationally is okay by you, who am I to argue<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<br>
<br>Also, I'm willing to place a bet on that an average man on the streets of Islamabad knows more about USA than an average man on the streets of New York knows about Pakistan.  (The greatest culprit behind that oddity: Hollywood.  The second greatest: the Coca Cola - McDonalds - Disney - CNN - Etc empire.)

Sure, they know more about us than we know about them, but it's mostly superficial.  *shrug*
<br>
<br> <p>Eh, and maybe he made an ass out of himself, but who really cares?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Yeah, it wouldn't be anything new, would it?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

What would count as deeper knowledge of the US?

I dunno.  Something more than what's in Hollywood and in our White House.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

  It makes him look bad to <em>everyone</em> else, not just in Pakistan. That gives a bad image of a country, and certainly doesn't help foreign trade and politics. When asked about Talibans (pre-9-11) a guy that answers "Yes, a nice rock band. I think my daughter listens to them." will require an army of diplomats to get any international consensus on issues relating to Talibans (which is more or less what happened). Americans would be much less hated throughout the world if those that represent them had the respect to ask some assistant to do some reading before they open their mouths. I wish that would happen, it'd make quite a few things easier<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
</p>

<p>
  But then GW is probably beyond being saved at this point.
</p>

<p>
  I also don't think it's wise to risk diplomatic trouble -- however slight -- with a country that has the A bomb.

Whatever.  No one really cares.  They care about action.  I would in fact doubt it makes him look bad to anyone.  People who think he looks bad from this already thought he looked bad.  People who didn't care will continue to not care.  People who like him will continue to.  Life goes on.
