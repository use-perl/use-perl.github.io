<p>Dear Log,

<p><blockquote>&laquo;French voters' opposition to the EU constitution
rose to a record high yesterday, amid mounting concern in Brussels
that an apparently inevitable French non will torpedo the treaty
before it is launched.  For a majority of French voters, the
referendum presents a risk-free opportunity to punish the government
for a string of deeply unpopular social and economic reforms.&raquo;
<blockquote>--<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/france/story/0,11882,1468614,00.html">"French opposition to EU constitution hits new high"</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>If I may rework a timeless joke: Why doesn't someone get George
Bush to come out against the EU draft constitution?  Then the whole
civilized world would clamor to adopt it instantly and unanimously.

<p>And it wouldn't be too hard to get him to oppose it anyway.  After
all, it's full of ideas like banning descrimination against gays and women and women-gays, and
like forbidding the death penalty (or even deporting people to countries
where they could face the death penalty or torture or anything).

<p>So it's a point-for-point contradiction of the Texas GOP platform.

<p>Even just
pointing out that the EU constitution could never be passed in the US (where many states are tripping over eachother to <em>constitutionally require</em> descrimination against gays)
is all the publicity that the thing should ever need!

<p>This reminds me: Has anyone actually tried
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2950276.stm">reading
the thing</a>?  This proposed EU constitution, I mean.  Everyone says
it's as cryptic as some sort of ISO standard for slurry pumps. But
I've been looking at the thing, and for the most part it's quite
clear -- much clearer in fact than the US's constitution, which 
reads like the fine print on a Late-Baroque insurance policy.

<p>This is an application of a general principle:
Texts that are widely considered incomprehensible, are usualy totally clear.  Corollary: texts that are universally
revered, are usually tripe.

<p>As to the <em>tone</em> of the EU constitution -- it is a bit saccharine.  Not enough existential dread.  That probably explains why it's unpopular in LaFrons.
