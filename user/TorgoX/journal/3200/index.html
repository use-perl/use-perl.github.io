<p>Dear Log,
<p>So is there an actually <em>good</em> reason for the fact that I can't plug a USB cable into my laptop and into my PC and have them both magically notice the other's existence, and do something useful like allow file-swapping?  I can plug a mouse into my PC's USB port and have it magically start working, so why not another computer?</p>

Yes.  File swapping <a href="http://www.napster.com/" title="napster.com">is wrong</a napster.com>.
<p>
Seriously, though, I think the other end of the USB cable is supposed to be a slave device (printer, mouse, HD).  What you're trying to do is get two master devices talking to each other, which is beyond the scope of the problems USB is trying to solve.  It's like trying to get two computers to talk to each other using ethernet without putting  a hub in between (or realizing you need a crossover cable).

USB-- for lack of dwimmery though.</p>

Perhaps a modem is a good analogy as well? My computer works fine calling out with a modem but it's not really set to do anything with <em>incoming</em> modem calls?

<p>Remember, the S is for "serial."  When you want to plug two computers together with a serial port, you can't just use a serial cable, you need a null-modem cable.  In the same way, I think you need a crossover USB cable to handle this.  Not to mention some special software.  (I hope you're using an open OS, or you're probably out of luck!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) )</p>

<p>I've heard that people have burned their USB controllers trying this.  Wouldn't know personally; the only USB controller I ever burned was hooked up to sonars and a camera, not another computer.</p>
