<p>Dear Log,

<p>Now, I <em>worried</em> that a Spanish translation of the
<cite>Star-Spangled Banner</cite> wouldn't preserve the awfulness of
the original English lyrics  while still respecting the atonal aimlessness of
the tune.  In fact, there was the real possibility of a Spanish
translation that would be better than the English.

<p>But the Spanish translation now in the news
(<a href=
 "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-060426nuestro,0,6454902.story?coll=chi-news-hed"
 >lyrics here</a>) happens to be just really damn bad, beyond
anything I could ever have anticipated.  It's as if they held a
translation contest, and picked the very <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0897333659">worst</a> entry.

<p>Even the worst-metered NorteÃÂ±o umpÃÂ¡-umpÃÂ¡ song has better meter than
this.  This translation has at least one tonguetwister <em>and</em> one serious mis-scan on
every line.  

<p>Granted, the whole notion of trying to fit words to the Star-Spangled
Banner's horrible (and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-spangled_banner">copied</a>)
music is sort of... pataphysical.  But the only thing I've ever seen
that approached this level of awfulness is Native American
translations of hymns that try to translate a line like "silent night
/ holy night" with something thirteen syllables long, all hurriedly
sung.

<p>I mean, just look:

<p>ÃÂ¿Oh say can you see, a la luz de la aurora
<br>Lo que tanto aclamamos la noche al caer?
<br>Sus estrellas, sus franjas flotaban ayer
<br>En el fiero combate en senal de victoria,
<br>Fulgor de lucha, al paso de la libertada,
<br>Por la noche decian: "Se va defendiendo!"
<br>ÃÂ¡Oh, decid! ÃÂ¿Despliega aÃÂºn su hermosura estrellada,
<br>Sobre tierra de libres, la bandera sagrada?</p>


<p>You know you're in trouble when the very first line has
the near-palindrome "la aurora", with all those vowels trying
pathetically to fit into one beat.  And it doesn't get better.

<p>The English has occasional phonetic horrors, like the consonantal
apocalypse in "whose broad stripes and bright stars", but this Spanish
translation manages to outdo that by replacing the solid 
"oh say does that", with "ÃÂ¡oh, decid! ÃÂ¿despliega aÃÂºn".
First off, "decid" is a vosotros imperative verb form, which for
Latin American Spanish comes off as something between arcane and
eldritch.

<p>And then, just to remind us that we can still feel pain,
"despliega aÃÂºn" is inflicted on us.  In
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA">IPA</a>, that's 
[d&#x25b;splj&#x25b;gaaun], and yes, that is a valid phonetic string
in Spanish.  <em>Somehow.</em>  Normally, good taste would stop
an actual occurrence of that in poetry or song, but good taste has had no part in this so far, and isn't about to start now.

<p>Spanish has a poetic tradition that was alive and well when Angles
and Saxons were just puzzling over whether you could rhyme "eaÃÂ°fynde"
and "gehwelcne", but it's not like you could tell from this
translation.  (There <a
href="http://patrick-townson.livejournal.com/33862.html">have
been other translations</a>, ya know!)

<p>To explain in English terms-- imagine someone tried to compose a hymn whose
first four lines two lines contained the words "exploits",
"strengths", "insurer", "lasts", "lorgnette", and "whencesoever"-- and
<em>then</em> tried to stretch "bitterer" across five long beats.

<p>And then, because mere lyrics and melody are not painful enough,
there is <a href=
 "http://hosted.ap.org/specials/interactives/_entertainment/anthem/anthem.mp3"
 >the actual performance</a> [4MB mp3].  It is a horror worse than
Lovecraft could have imagined, because even he could not have pictured
a chorus of Cthulhus
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/TorgoX/journal/16471">gospel-yodeling</a> in the high tradition of
CÃÂ©line Dion and/or <cite>American Idol</cite>.

<p>It STINKS.

<p>I would say try <em>again,</em> make a decent version
in Spanish, you can do it, sÃÂ­ se puede!  But no, this version is so
awful in every way, that there are no do-overs allowed.

<p>I say we mandate (under penalty
of <a href=
 "http://use.perl.org/user/TorgoX/journal/29237"
 >torrrturrrre!</a>) that the Glorious Solemn Hymn Of Our National
Civic Religion With Flag must not be soiled by being sung in any
ffffilthy fffforeign language -- including English!  It should be sung
<em>only</em> in the words of any of the
<a href="http://haidalanguage.org/">hundreds</a>
<a href="http://www.olelo.hawaii.edu/" >of</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_language" >languages</a>
actually native to what is <a href=
"http://interglacial.com/temp/10_000_miles.jpg"
>now the US</a>.  Wave after wave of Europeans came to
this continent and stomped on Native culture as if it were on fire,
and the least they can do now is
<a href=
 "http://www.wm.edu/linguistics/creek/"
 >learn the language</a>.
