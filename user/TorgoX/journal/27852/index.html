<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;In a damning and wide-ranging indictment of Iraq's escalating human rights catastrophe, Allawi accused fellow Shias in the government of being responsible for death squads and secret torture centres. The brutality of elements in the new security forces rivals that of Saddam's secret police, he said.
<p>Allawi, who was a strong ally of the US-led coalition forces and was prime minister until this April, made his remarks as further hints emerged yesterday that President George Bush is planning to withdraw up to 40,000 US troops from the country next year, when Iraqi forces will be capable of taking over.&raquo;<blockquote

<p><blockquote
>&laquo;The state-owned TV station broadcasting the trial showed a little
operetta, sung by kids, during the court's recess. It is set at
the trial, and the singing lawyer demands that the sentence be "a
thousand deaths, a thousand deaths, for he is a war criminal",
calling Saddam's lawyers men without honour.
<p>The judge, after some musical deliberations, sings: "We sentence
you to death, to death to death". Case closed. And the official
newspaper used the lower part of the front page on the day of the
trial for a montage of pictures including a sign saying "death to
Saddam". There is no question what the people want.&raquo;<blockquote
