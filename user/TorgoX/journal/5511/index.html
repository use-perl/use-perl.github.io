<p>Dear Log,<p>
I heard this on a public service announcement on TV the other day:
<blockquote>
"Television is for everyone, but every show isn't. So check out what
your kids are watching; you know them better than anyone."
</blockquote>
For extra credit, translate the above into predicate logic notation.
And yes, this <em>will</em> be on the test.

Very good!  I particularly like how you notated what the TV copy-writer
meant (there's some shows that aren't for some people), instead of what he said (every show is not for everyone -- i.e., every show has people that it's not for; or: "for" doesn't describe the relationship between every show and everybody -- so maybe some shows are AGAINST everyone, or BY everyone, etc.)

<p>I'm not sure what to do about the plurality on "kids" tho -- there's a reading where everyone being addressed has several children each; but there's other readings.

</p><p>And strictly speaking, you miss pointing out that "you" refers to personB and personC, but we'll take that as a given.  And you assume that "you" menas <em>exactly</em> two parents -- but it's possible that it means less, or more, which may or may not be <em>all</em> the parents of "your kids" -- so that the "anyone" in "you know them better than anyone" could include the kids' other parents, who aren't included in "you".

</p><p>But you didn't catch the existential presupposition in "You know [your kids] better than anyone" -- i.e., that you DO have kids.  But then, I don't recall how predicate notation deals with presuppositions versus actual assertions.
</p><p>Interesting that you turned "[the medium of] television [on the whole]" into "all televisions", tho.

</p><p>Incidentally, the treatment of "knows better" in true PRED(arg,arg,...) notation is somewhat tricky, since it's both an adverb and a comparative.

</p><p>Now I have a headache, and I need a nap!
</p><p>BTW, your seekrit prize pak consists of me now telling you
that HTML4 adds the not-yet-well-supported entities
&amp;forall; and &amp;exist;, beside the older &amp;not;</p>

<tt>&gt; I'm not sure what to do about the plurality on "kids"<br> <br>hmmm...<br> <br>Maybe it should be read as something like for each<br>personA, for each personB if personB is a kid of personA<br>....<br> <br>&gt; that "you" refers to personB and personC<br> <br>another item for the conjunctive chain... but then that<br>gives you a slopy bit of PL. Some folks would read it<br>and have it come up false, while otherw sould have it<br>come up true, which ties into your comment<br> <br>&gt; i.e., that you DO have kids<br> <br>which could be addressed by something like the above<br>where you say for each person who is one of your kids<br>which accomodates zero-to-n kids.<br> <br>&gt; you assume that "you" menas exactly two parents<br> <br>and could also take care of that, since we'd be going<br>from the one person to all of their kids (possibly all<br>zero of their kids) instead of from the kid to their<br>however-many parents.<br> <br>&gt; television [on the whole]" into "all televisions"<br> <br>more laziness.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)&nbsp; I started off thinking in the same<br>terms as the author, but then got all gnarled up in<br>too many layers of refinement and just said "fuck it"<br>and did physical tvs instead. The author doesn't want<br>to say that everything about "the medium of television"<br>is for everyone, but rather that for some folks, some<br>aspect of it is not for them. But maybe it's not really<br>some aspect which they find so problematic, but a<br>collection of individual bits which separately are<br>tollerable, but together really make the medium suck<br>for that person (and the bits could be different per<br>each person).<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...and maybe the bits are still ok with<br>that person when taken all together, but only within<br>certain contexts (WTC coverage can have footage of<br>violence and gore, but cartoons can't).<br> <br>So I took the easy way out. It's just for fun<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>&gt; "knows better" in true PRED(arg,arg,...)<br> <br>The easiest way would seem to be to make it a 3-arg<br>predicate. If you wanted to get fancy, you could use<br>a higher-order predicate calculus (which can take as<br>args other predicates). Then you've got the predicate<br>of x_knows_y(_,_), and the higher-order predicate<br>x_does_P_better_than_y(_,_,_).<br> <br>&gt; seekrit prize pak<br> <br>gracias!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>I'll have to use this prize in another context, as I<br>have vowed to post in 'Code' at use.perl.org since<br>I'm too lazy to use 'Preview' regularly, and this got<br>me in trouble when trying to post about perl6-flavored<br>regex syntax.<br> <br>-matt<br> <br>who thinks modal logic is a silly special case of<br>higher-order predicate logic, not worth most of the<br>man-hours folks have spent writting about it.</tt>

<em>As with the original, it claims that parents know their kids better than those kids know themselves.</em> <br> <br>Until the kids are teenagers, this is almost always the case.  When the kids are teenagers, this is often the case (that is, it should be the case, most of the time, if the parents are doing their job).<br>
