<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;What do fundagelicals instinctively oppose? Gay marriage, abortion, gun
control, taxes, the UN (and the currently top-rated candidate for
anti-Christ, Kofi Annan), withdrawal from Iraq, Michael Moore, Janet
Jackson's left breast.&raquo;

Fungeidelicals?  What?  SHROOMING WITH JESUS?</p>

Is that related to Fundaligionism (Hallelujahgobble!)?



<h2>Ah, that explains everything...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2004-05-03T17:43:32</h3>
no comment.

I represent that remark.  Although, I am in favor of civil unions, and some controls on firearms.  I think the UN is a cute little organization that we have no responsibility to follow.  Michael Moore is great, he makes Bush look good by contrast.  Oh, and Jackson's breast is fine, as long as I am given fair warning.

<p> <em>Michael Moore is great, he makes Bush look good by contrast.</em> </p>

<p>No kidding.  I used to think he was great since he seemed to be a spokesman for many of my political views, but like the assinine "why do we murder people to show murder is wrong" argument, he's so full of slipshop logic and sleight-of-tongue that I feel he's an embarrassment to the left.</p>

<p> <em>Oh, and Jackson's breast is fine, as long as I am given fair warning.</em> </p>

<p>So you can program your Tivo in time?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<em>So you can program your Tivo in time?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</em> <br> <br>Not that you could see anything anyway, it was too far away and on a low-res TV<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br> <br>I watched the Super Bowl with my family and nephews and in-laws.  I knew MTV was doing the halftime show so we didn't watch, because duh, MTV and these "artists" do a lot of things inappropriate -- IMO -- for young kids.  So that was warning enough for me.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>I try to say, "fine, you're not offended by it, so you should be able to watch it," but none of the arguments people have made in favor of such things on TV justifies showing it when there's no fair warning given.  If they had said, "a woman's clothes will be violently torn off, exposing her breast," then people couldn't complain about seeing it, right?  Then at least the debate shifts to whether it should be on at all, instead of conflating it with the fact that it took so many people by surprise.<br> <br>I'm rambling now, so I'll stop.  I'd rewrite, but I am tired.<br>
