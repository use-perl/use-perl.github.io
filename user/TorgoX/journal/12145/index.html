<p>Dear Log,

<br>From:  Aniruddh  Patel &lt;apatel@nsi.edu&gt;
<br>Subject:  drum vocable experiment 

<p>Dear Linguist List, 

<p>We are doing research on the acoustic and perceptual relationship of
speech sounds and drum sounds in North Indian tabla music. In this
tradition, spoken nonsense syllables are used to label drum sounds. This
way, players can communicate drum sequences either by playing them or by
speaking the associated syllables. We want to know if it's possible for
people who don't know Indian music to guess which syllable goes with
which drum sound.

<p>We would like to invite anyone who is interested to try a web experiment
in which you match spoken syllables to drum sounds. This web experiment
is not being used to collect data for publication (we are doing a lab
study for that purpose). Rather, we are interested in the acoustic and
perceptual cues people use to make their decisions, and invite your
feedback on this issue (via a questionnaire at the end of the
experiment).

<p>Here is a link to the experiment: <a href="http://www.nsi.edu/tablaexp">http://www.nsi.edu/tablaexp</a>

<p>Please feel free to pass on this invitation to anyone who might be
interested. 

<p>Thank you,

<h2>Threefold reminiscence</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rafael/">rafael</a> on 2003-05-13T08:57:06</h3>
If I remember correctly, John Coltrane (and his last drummer, Rashied Ali) were
interested in this drum notation.<p>Reminds me also the arbitrary syllables
that are used to signify the notes of the major scale in latin countries.
</p><p>Reminds me, as well, Steve Coleman's recording <a href="http://www.m-base.com/taobio.html" title="m-base.com">The Tao of Mad Phat</a m-base.com>, where, on the
tune <i>Laid Back Schematics</i> (an instantaneous compostion), Coleman
 <i>sings</i> to his drummer the drum line he wants him to play
(after having similarly dictated to the guitarist, pianist and bassist their
own lines.)</p>
