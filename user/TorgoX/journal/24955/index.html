<div class="span8">
<p>Dear Log,
<p>I left New Mexico just a few years ago, and I have presumed
that New Mexico hasn't changed a whit in my absence.

<p>And if I were told to guess what changes actually have taken place
in New Mexico, my guesses would have been fluctuations in the price
and popularity of horrible street drugs.  But it turns out that I
missed a significant change in the local Native arts.

<p>The other night, I stumbled on a Frontline/World piece about <a
href="http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/mexico403/">the
potters of the town of Mata Ortiz</a>, which is over the border
into "Old Mexico", as New Mexicans refer to what's south of them.

<p>I had heard of Mata Ortiz pottery before, but had assumed that it
was like the pottery of the Pueblos in New Mexico -- namely, the
modern products of a continuous artistic tradition going back at least
five or six centuries.  But it turns out (the Frontline/World story
goes) that pottery in Mata Ortiz basically died out some centuries
ago, and was only recently resurrected by a local artist, Juan
Quezada, who basically reverse-engineered the old process (amazing
thing 1) from pots and tools found in local ruins.  And he succeded,
(amazing thing 2).

<p>He then taught the art to other local folks, who (amazing thing 3)
took to it with astonishing ability.  They basically started
reproducing elaborations on the designs on the ancient pottery, which
looked to be like New Mexican pottery but with slightly odd
<a href="http://www.mataortiz.com/mata/baudellopezcls.htm">forms</a>
and
<a href="http://www.mataortiz.com/mata/ismaelflores.htm">twists</a>.
And they started making big money. (Amazing thing 4)

<p>But then, as I moved to Alaska, things got weird.  Mata Ortiz
potters took the local ancient styles as just a starting point; and
then they got 
<a
href="http://www.mataortiz.com/images/rosariovelozollasn2.jpg">weird</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.mataortiz.com/mata/adrianrojasfish.htm">Escheresque</a>,
and then they started using 
<a href="http://www.mataortiz.com/mata/noequezadancsmc.htm">absurdly
fine detail</a>, fine gradations in color with tiny tiny lines that
<a href="http://www.mataortiz.com/images/lydiaponcewedding1.jpg">just
barely show up on camera</a>, like if Keith Haring were
<a
href="http://www.mataortiz.com/mata/laurabugariniminiatureb.htm">designing
microchips</a>.  And then they started making
even more money. (Amazing things 5+)

<p>And then it started influencing New Mexico pottery.
Lots of the stuff <a
href="http://www.pueblopottery.com/other~1.htm">here</a> has
kinds of flourishes that I never saw even three years ago.

<p>So, in conclusion: using just local dirt and natural pigments and glazes, people in the middle of
nowhere, <em>who probably don't even have DSL!,</em> are making space-bending ceramic hallucinations.  They are elaborating a millenia-old art form, but are making it evolve faster than, say, the
US pop music market, which has been crosseyed and aimless for about
ten years now, in spite of having orders of magnitude greater money, brains, and talented-manhours.</p>
