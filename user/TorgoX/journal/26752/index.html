<p>Dear Log,
<p>Speaking of Walter Benjamin...
<blockquote
>&laquo;For instance, a friend of middling taste recently leeched 700 songs
from my computer.  He offered his own library in return, but it wasn't
much.  Never mind my vague sense that he should pay me some money.  In
Rock Snob terms, I was a Boston Brahmin and he was a Beverly
Hillbilly--one who certainly hadn't earned that highly obscure album
of AC/DC songs performed as tender acoustic ballads but was sure to go
bragging to all his friends about it. Even worse was the girlfriend to
whom I gave an iPod.  She promptly plugged it into my computer and was
soon holding in her hand a duplicate version of my 5,000-song
library--a library that had taken some 20 years, thousands of dollars,
and about as many hours to accumulate.  She'd downloaded it all within
five minutes. And, a few months later, she was gone, taking my
intimate musical DNA with her.&raquo;<blockquote
