<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;<em>In the Karasawa Unit where you worked, did you ever participate in live human dissections?</em>
<p>
Yes. It started in December 1942. Before that, we used mice. But in 1942 the experiments I attended were on Chinese people. There were special-unit members who wore lab coats and carried guns in the treatment room. They had boots and field caps on. They brought the human specimens to the treatment room, and I drew their blood. We would draw blood and then test for antibodies. Then we would inject the plague vaccine that had been developed by Unit 731. After that, blood would be drawn and tested again. The live plague bacteria would be injected. Then, after they got critically sick, the doctors would start a dissection.&raquo;

<p>Now I see why the Japanese goverments since WW2 have been spending so much on
humanitarian causes (including funding Hawaiian and Alaskan language preservation
projects, incidentally): I guess it's because they feel a need to send a message.  The message being: We
<em>really really</em> stopped cutting open live people and also trying to bring back
the Black Death!</p>
