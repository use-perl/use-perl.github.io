<p>Dear Log,
<p>Well, we found the real-life Krusty the Klown....
<blockquote>&laquo;[Houellebecq's] hangdog look in the dock may have been due in part to reading depressing British reviews of <cite>Platform</cite>, which recounts Michel's adventures of selling sex holidays in Thailand.
<p><cite>The Guardian</cite> said it did not add up. <cite>The Sunday Times</cite> wrote it off as "pretentious, banal, badly written and boring" and the <cite>Times</cite> said that Mr Houellebecq, who French critics like to bracket with Albert Camus, was no more a novelist of ideas than Benny Hill.&raquo;<p

<h2>Houellebecq's books suck</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rafael/">rafael</a> on 2002-09-18T08:11:20</h3>
In fact I was going to post a journal entry about this. Being French, I do agree 100% with the Times here. (I don't like Camus very much, but at least he knew grammar, which is not the case of Houellebecq.)<p>Quoting from the Gardian article<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p><blockquote><div> <i>A petition being handed round by Sollers, the most assiduous self-publiciser among contemporary novelists, drew on the collective wisdom of an impressive legion of dead writers, beginning with Blaise Pascal and running through Montaigne, Voltaire and L&eacute;vi-Strauss, who have shocked by expressing outspoken views on religion.</i> </div></blockquote>
Hey, L&eacute;vi-Strauss (this genius) is not dead yet, AFAIK ! And comparing an anthropologist that worked on the process of evolution of myths and primitive religions with a short-sighted racist makes no sense. Houellebecq is just another poor writer, <i>un pauvre cr&eacute;tin</i>. He got some hype after the publication of his first books, due to some well-orchestrated media campaign; now he deserves this trial : somebody had to point out how untalented and stupid he really is.

I've read 'Plateforme' and 'Les particules &#233;l&#233;mentaires' (AKA 'Atomized'). Both are excellent especially the former and both were well-received by the critics in France. The fact that the author stated that Islam was the stupidest of religions or that sex tourism was a good thing have nothing to do with the quality of his work. I don't agree with him on those two points but I still think he's a very good writer. (BTW, I'm not French.)

<h2>The Economist on 'Plateforme'</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/boru/">boru</a> on 2002-09-18T10:28:37</h3>
There's an interesting article on Houellebecq in The Economist. Their critic's view is that 'Plateforme' makes 'good reading'. Here's the link (you might have to be a subscriber to read it):
