<p>Dear Log,
<p>Today it was blissfully sunny and warm, so I went out and
<a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos">took a whole lot of pictures</a>.
Then it was <em>stll</em> warm and sunny, so I attempted my first foray into
gardening since I was a kid in LA.
<p>In the sunniest corner of the garden, I tilled up some of the
thick black soil and planted some gladiolus bulbs, and some
seeds for nasturtium, morning glory, catnip, and some California poppy.
I have no idea if this is too early in the year to plant these things
in the local climate,
so I only planted about a third of the seeds/bulbs of each kind --
so if they sprout but get killed by a strange frost in late April,
then there'll still be more to plant.  Also, by staggering the plantings,
I hope to stagger the blooms.
<p>I've never seen or even heard of soil this rich; it makes potting
soil you get at the store look like beach-sand.
Literally every time
I turned the soil with my little hand-shovel, I'd turn up earthworms.
</p>

<h2>volcanic?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lachoy/">lachoy</a> on 2004-03-26T14:55:09</h3>
when I visited Anchorage in the summer a few years ago one of the locals showed me a tomato grown in the Mat-Su valley north of the city. Due to the volcanic soil and tons of sunlight the thing was nearly as big as my head. Yow!

Talking of photos, I see you got linked to by Sterling today. Good one! (And nice photos.)
