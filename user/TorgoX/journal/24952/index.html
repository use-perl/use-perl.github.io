<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;<br>
<p>* The majority of mainstream Serbian linguists still consider
Serbo-Croatian to be one language with two variants. Also, the
majority of Serbian linguists think that Serbo-Croatian is essentially
a Serbian-based language. A minority among Serbian linguists are of
the opinion that Serbo-Croatian did exist, but has, in the meantime,
dissolved. A small minority aver that a "Serbo-Croatian" language has
never existed and that this term designates a Croatian variant of the
Serbian language.

<p>* The majority of Croatian linguists think that there was never
anything like a unified Serbo-Croatian language, but two different
standard languages that overlapped sometime in the course of
history. Also, they claim that no language has ever dissolved, since
there was no Serbo-Croatian standard language. A minority of Croatian
linguists deny that the Croatian standard language is based on the
neo-Shtokavian dialect; also, another minority of Croatian
linguists claim that the Serbian language is an offshoot of Croatian,
since as a system of dialects it is a subset of the Croatian system of
dialects.

<p>* The majority of Bosniak linguists consider that the Serbo-Croatian
language still exists and that it is based on the Bosnian idiom. A
minority of Bosniak linguists think that Croats and Serbs have,
historically, "misappropriated" the Bosnian language for their
political and cultural agenda.
