<p><p>Dear Log,
<p>[sfx: white noise]
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;American attitudes towards Islam were not out of step with Europe, Mr
Dougherty said, adding that there was more tolerance in the US towards
the use of headscarves than in countries such as Germany or France,
where there is strong support for a ban.
<br><br>  But nearly half of Americans, 46%, said they held unfavourable
attitudes towards Islam - compared with 24% in January
2002.&raquo;<blockquote

<p><blockquote
>&laquo;It is all rather depressing, but let me make clear that there are good
Americans out there, whose voices are only just being heard above the
whir of the Republican money-counting machines - people such as Erik
Reece and Robert Kennedy Jr and many unknown environmental
campaigners. They deserve our support during this Appalachian spring,
however distant.&raquo;<blockquote

country"</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<p><blockquote
>&laquo;'The West can impose many cultural influences on us because they have
the most powerful media in the world,' Alimi said. 'But we cannot
export our culture to America, even though Iran has a history and
culture that's far older. We are under a cultural bombardment.'&raquo;<blockquote

<p><blockquote
>&laquo;"As for you, black Condoleezza Rice, swallow your tongue, remember
your origins and stop talking about liberation and freedom. Have you
not been taught by your cowboy masters that 'slaves' cannot liberate
themselves, that they are not capable to capture the large Islamic
world whose cultural roots are planted in the depths of history? The
slaves who are happy with their enslavement, O Condoleezza, will
continue to be enslaved. They will never be free and will never free
others."&raquo;<blockquote
