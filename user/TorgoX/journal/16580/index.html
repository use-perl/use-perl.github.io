<p>Dear Log,
<p>Today I worked a bit trying to make my RSS-generator module
releasable, and I  then took advantage of the uncommonly clear
skies today to take some
<a href="http://www.interglacial.com/d/photos">more 
pictures</a>.
This time I walked around for hours, partly in an unfamiliar neighborhood,
on the other side of the mountain from downtown.  I was slowly
accosted by
<a href="http://www.interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-01-01/mildlife_1.jpg">small
livestock</a> who thought I was a food pi&ntilde;ata.

<p>The photo haul today was decent, I think.
<a href="http://www.interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-01-01/gulls8.jpg">Only
one pic</a> really leaps out at me, but as I manage to
forget what the things are pictures of, and to concentrate on the composition,
I start liking the look of some of the others, like
<a href="http://www.interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-01-01/fishladder.jpg">the
Escher-esque fishladder</a>.

<p>None of the 2004-01-01 set have any color correction, by the way -- beyond
what the camera did on its own.  I'm starting to get to know this camera's
personality.  Part of it is pure optical properties, like its focal depth.
But part of it is the internal software's habits of color correction and
whatnot -- it's not just copying pixels onto the chip memory, but
first makes all sort of adjustments to brightness, contrast, and
saturation.  It does things that I would not have thought of, but which I
generally approve of.</p>

So what's a fishladder?

OK, googling for "fishladder" told me what I wanted to know.

<p>

I like this one: "<a href="http://www.interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-01-01/mildlife_6.jpg" title="interglacial.com">Use the GPL, damn you!</a interglacial.com>"</p>
