<p>Dear Log,
<p>The news keeps going on and on about that
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,665383,00.html">pesky
ethnic civil war</a> in
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/TorgoX/journal/2605">Philistia</a>.  It's so dull!
Well, it <em>used</em> to be very compelling, very high concept --
you know, like <a href="http://www.battlebots.com/">Battlebots!</a>  Except with
<a href="http://www.terrybisson.com/meat.html">meat.</a>

<p>So I'm thinking of kill-filing the whole thing in my news bot.  I mean, it's
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,665385,00.html">got action</a> alright, but it's really poorly edited.  It's worse than football!  And the script <a href="http://weber.ucsd.edu/Depts/Ethnic/fac/rfrank/ES-130/Onate.html">goes nowhere,</a> and the writer has a tin ear for dialogue; all anyone ever says is
"<em>This'll</em> teach 'em a lesson!", which of course <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,664470,00.html">never really works.</a>
It's getting as dull as <a href="http://www.nbc.com/passions/"><cite>Passions</cite></a> was
after Heccuba left!

<p>I wanna see coked-up fightin' cyborgs, shaolin sky-fighting, swordplay, and maybe some Mila Jojovich muay tai foxy boxing in catsuits.  What do I get?  Dogfaced fifteen-year-olds bleeding to death, and the smell of charred flesh -- as if <em>that</em> worked well on screen!  And endless footage of endless waits at checkpoints, and everyone is badly dressed, without even a solid Africanized destitution/desperation look that would at least pull in some street cred.  It's a cinematic worst case scenario!  And there's no excuse -- I mean,
<a href="http://www.palestinecenter.org/cpap/pubs/20010130ib.html">the budget is there</a> for Christsakes!
But then, the Philistines
<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Davidson,+Boaz">could never make a decent movie</a> anyhow.

<p>At this point, not even <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4370611,00.html">Tarrantino</a>
could make this interesting.  I want a
<a href="http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/010201/0101015.html">refund.</a>
</p>

<h2>Think of it as part 2</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-03-22T16:36:59</h3>
This is the second part of the trilogy.  Think the middle episode of Back to the Future where they went to the future and everything was the same as it was before only moreso.  If you stick with it, don't worry, you'll be rewarded with a good old-fashioned old we^H^Heast fight at the end, complete with trains, dames, horses, and handlebar moustachios.<br>
