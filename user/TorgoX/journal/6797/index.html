<p>Dear Log,
<p>Monday night I put out a new version of HTML-Tree. I'd been dreading it for well over a year, because I had a whole mess of half-baked half-implemented ideas for it.  But it wasn't really so bad -- diff -u to the rescue, and three or four hours of poking at it.  I think it was good having a fresh perspective at all, i.e., without being too close to the code.  I remember something Ray Bradbury once said -- something about the best thing you can do with your story is to put it in a drawer for a year, and then take it out and look at it.  Not exactly a great approach to "rapid development", but there's something to it.

<p>And last night, I ventured into non-Perl things, by editing and proofing the manual and English template file for CDex, my favorite (and open source) CD ripper.  Many improvements made; and hopefully few errors added.</p>

Sometimes I do that, just put it away and come back to it many months, or years, later.  The danger is that I do a diff and can't figure out what the hell I was thinking when I made the changes.

I've a similar problem at work. I code something. Supervisor reads it when he gets a chance and gives it a 'yay' or 'nay'. If 'yay', then I commit it and try to think of what the hell the net effect of my changes was (for the commit message). If 'nay', I have to think why the hell I did it the way I did it. Even when commented it doesn't always help. And, yes, the 'yay' or 'nay' can be days away from when I did the code.<br> <br>I should really keep a log, or "journal". Doubt they'll catch on. =)<br> <br>
