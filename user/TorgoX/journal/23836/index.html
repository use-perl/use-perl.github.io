<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;Nobody mentioned the dangerous course toward theocratic despotism --
or rather some did mention it, though their voices were effectively drowned out by larger moral
concerns, such as those occasioned by the sight of Janet Jackson's breast or a gay groom's boutonniere.&raquo;
	<blockquote>--<a href="http://harpers.org/LifeEverlasting.html">"Life Everlasting:"</a>
The religious right and the right to die</blockquote></blockquote>
Too much love?
<p><blockquote>&laquo;Countries go insane like people go insane...&nbsp; Most places just are something, but America had
to mean something too, hence her vulnerability - to make-believe, to false memory, false
destiny.&nbsp; And finally it looked as though the riveting struggle with illusion was over,
and America had lost...&nbsp; America thought she was awake, brightly awake, but in reality
she was sleeping, and deep-dreaming;&nbsp;
and she was all by herself.&nbsp; She wanted to be good, to be
better - special.&nbsp; We all do.&nbsp;
<p>When you go insane, what happens?&nbsp; Wanting to be good and right: can this do it?&nbsp; Can love do it?&nbsp; Too much love, and all of the wrong kind.&nbsp; Love unreturned, tantrum love, collapsing into hurt feelings.&nbsp; Feelings ripped and torn.&nbsp; Inconsolable America, cruelly stung, breathing deeply, and not coming out to play.&nbsp; Marriageably she slept, and dreamt, and thought she was awake.
&raquo;<blockquote>- Martin Amis
