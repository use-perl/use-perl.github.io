<p>Dear Log,
<p>I hereby expose you to a bit of prose that depicts something that I refer to, in my personal lexicon, as simply "The Nightmare":

<p><blockquote>&laquo;Shutting down the Troupe's systems was delicate
work.&nbsp; Even the minor systems, for instance, the little telephone
switches, had a million or more lines of antique corporate
freeware.&nbsp; The software had been created by vast teams of
twentieth-century software engineers, hired labor for extinct
telephone empires like AT&amp;T and SPRINT.&nbsp; It was freeware
because it was old, and because everybody who'd ever made it was
either dead now or in other work.&nbsp; Those armies of telephone
engineers were now as scattered and extinct as the Soviet Red Army.

<p>Those armies of engineers had basically been automated out of
existence, replaced by higher-and-higher-level expert systems, that
did error checks, bug hunts, resets, fault recoveries.&nbsp; Now a
single individual could use the technology -- any individual with a power
plug and a desk.&nbsp; The sweat and talent of tens of thousands of
clever people had vanished into a box you could hold in your hand and
buy in a flea market.

<p>The Troupe's switching stations were cheap-ass little Malaysian-made
boxes of recycled barf-colored plastic.&nbsp; They cost about as much
as a pair of good shoes.

<p>There wasn't a single human being left in the world who fully
understood what was going on inside those little boxes.&nbsp;
Actually, no single human being in the world had ever understood an
intellectual structure of that complexity.&nbsp; Any box running a
million lines of code was far beyond the direct comprehension of any
human brain.&nbsp; And it was simply impossible to watch those modern
screamer-chips grind that old code, on any intimate line-by-line
basis.&nbsp; It was like trying to listen in on every conversation in
a cocktail party bigger than Manhattan.

<p>As a single human individual, you could only interface with that code
on a very remote and abstract level -- you had to negotiate with the
code, gently, politely, and patiently, the way you might have dealt
with a twentieth-century phone company.&nbsp; You owned a
twentieth-century phone company -- it was all inside the box now.

<p>As you climbed higher and higher up the stacks of interface, away from
the slippery bedrock of the hardware grinding the ones and zeros, it
was like walking on stilts.

<p>And then, stilts for your stilts, and stilts for your stilts for your
stilts.&nbsp; You could plug a jack in the back of the box and run
like the wind of the wind.&nbsp; Until something crashed somewhere,
that the system's system's system couldn't diagnose and figure out and
override.&nbsp; Then you threw the little box away and plugged in
another one.&nbsp; The Troupe's system was temperamental.&nbsp; To say
the least.&nbsp; For instance, the order in which you detached the
subsystems mattered a lot.&nbsp; There was no easy or direct
explanation as to why that should matter, but it mattered
plenty.&nbsp; Jane kept careful professional track of the system's
incongruities, its wealth of senseless high-level knots and kinks and
cramps.&nbsp; She kept her notes with pencil and paper, in a little
looseleaf leather notebook she'd had since college.&raquo;
