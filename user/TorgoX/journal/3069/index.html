<p>Dear Log,
<p>Since I <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/TorgoX/journal/2566">started Paxil</a>, my dreams have been very frequent, and very dull.  The latest one involved someone telling me that the the lyrics to 
<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/underworld/pearlsgirl.html">"Pearl's Girl"</a> had been "translated".  Whether to another language, or from another language, was unclear.
Another involved hearing that the US Mint had invented "edible small change" -- apparently without consulting the Centers for Disease Control.</p>

How long do the effects of the Paxil last?  Could you arrange for the effects to wear off before bed time?

All SSRI effects depend on the person.  But in my case, it does seem to be a bit lesser now that I've switched to taking it in the morning.  (When I was taking it at "bedtime", I would be up for hours, obviating the whole the question of dreaming.  Others report a reverse effect.  And many of these effects seem to come and go (usually go) over the course of weeks or months.

<p>
I'll second that notion; the differences can be remarkably drastic.</p>

It's statements such as these that have led me to believe that psychiatric drugs such as Paxil are Bad Stuff(tm).  If the effects are so unpredictable[1], and vary from patient to patient, then how can physicians know with any certainty that they are doing no harm, or even likely to bring about an improvement by prescribing these drugs?
<p>
Perhaps that's just an expression of the computer scientist lurking underneath that is fundementally uncomfortable with nearly random processes. It's less about psychiatric drugs than new medicines; I could say similar things about Viagra as well (&laquo;<i>some patients reported seeing everything as if it were viewed through a blue filter for a few hours</i>&raquo;; eyes are the other Really Important Thing You Don't Mess With(tm)).
</p><p>
Nevertheless, it's quite refreshing and reassuring to hear about your positive experiences with Paxil.  Hopefully you can return to your normally scheduled dreaming soon.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

[1] An ex-girlfriend once reported having an "alergic reaction" to some psychiatric medication; the result to a bad prescription was that she bounced around on a bunch of different drugs until she evened out.  Given the source, I take this annecdote with a shovel full of salt, but it still leaves me uncomfortable.</p>
