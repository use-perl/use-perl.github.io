<p>Dear Log,
<p>Hither:
<p><blockquote>&laquo;I remember when Bush in the famous debate in Iowa said that <a href="http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/gosthom.html">Jesus Christ</a>
was <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/040511/ids_photos_wl/ra3756664362.jpg&e=6&ncid=1778">his favorite political philosopher.</a> I always thought the problem was
not with that answer, which is a legitimate answer. But when he was
asked to explain this, he basically said, "If you haven't had this
experience, you don't know what it is."

<p>I was offended by that, because I thought, in a sense, in a tolerant
democracy, a politician has an obligation to explain things to people
who don't necessarily accept their religious terms.

<p>I had an assistant at the time who was a Democrat, no friend of
Bush's, but an evangelical Christian. She was upset with me, because she
said, "That's how we talk. You should understand that." I think it's
those moments, when Bush speaks like that, that evangelicals know in
their hearts that he's one of them.&raquo;

<p>-- <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jesus/interviews/dionne.html">E.J. Dionne, interviewed</a>
in
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jesus/">Frontline's
episode on Bush's religiousness</a></blockquote>
<p>And yon:
<p><blockquote>&laquo;I think, fundamentally, many of these Evangelical and social Christians
like George Bush. They like what he's done on partial-birth abortion,
they like what he's done in terms of appointees, they like what he's
done in the war.

<p>I was down in Georgia the other day talking to some pastors; and when
I talk to them about the war in Iraq, they understand fundamentally, in
ways that George Bush does not talk about, that this is part of a
millennial crusade -- Bush got in trouble using the word "crusade" --
You talk to to some pastors in suburban Atlanta, they understand that
this war is against the Muslems, against the Infidel, in a way that in
fundamental ways hasn't changed in a thousand years.

<p>They see that this is the president who's engaged in something bigger
than just this moment.

who appears in <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jesus/">Frontline's
episode on Bush's religiousness</a></blockquote>

<p>I'm achingly tired of being trapped in other people's
<a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/religion/televangelists/robert-tilton/"
>country-fried mythologies.</a>
It's like being confined to
<a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/articles.php?a=2142">a fur con</a>,
except they're <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/user/discutant/115623.html">running
the country</a>.  It's like Ren-faire Taliban.</p>

Everyone has their own mythologies.  If the guy in charge shared yours, then the rest of the country would be annoyed.  Boo-fricking-hoo.<br> <br>As to Dionne<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... the problem is that when evangelicals give the real answer, non-Christians say it sounds ridiculous, or doesn't make sense.  It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.  But I think Dionne's analysis beyond that is astute.

The problem is that Bush's answer wasn't the real answer, because it wasn't an answer at all, it was a self-aware shirk, avec smirk.
<p>Even if I consider the "You totally wouldn't understand" subject to the niceties of moral relativism (everyone has their own <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0420/perlstein.php" title="villagevoice.com">mythologies...</a villagevoice.com>), it's still too obscurantist (by far) to be coming out of the mouth of anyone even pretending to be a public leader.</p>

<p>Exactly!  Why tell the truth (much less the Truth) when someone will always complain?

He did tell the truth.  Futher, it's not like he was hiding anything.  He merely didn't evangelize on national TV.  Oh, the horror!

He should have explained, instead of dodging <em>or</em> evangelizing.  Instead he just sort of blithered.



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:President Counterfactual</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2004-05-19T21:59:29</h3>
And I am saying, if he did explain without evangelizing, he would have been accused of evangelizing.  And probably by you.
