<p>Dear Log,
<p>Extract from <a href="http://pp.kpnet.fi/seirioa/cdenn/whenphil.htm">"When Philosophers Encounter AI"</a>, in: Daedalus,
<cite>Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences</cite>,
117, 283-295, Winter 1988. Reprinted in S. Graubard, ed., <cite>The
Artificial Intelligence Debate: False Starts, Real Foundations</cite>,
MIT Press, 1988. Spanish translation, Gedisa, 1993; Polish translation
forthcoming in Znak, Cracow.


<blockquote>&laquo;[...]<br>This clash of vision was memorably displayed in a historic debate at
Tufts University in March of 1978, staged, appropriately, by the
Society for Philosophy and Psychology.  Nominally a panel discussion on
the foundations and prospects of Artificial Intelligence, it turned
into a tag-team rhetorical wrestling match between four heavyweight
ideologues: Noam Chomsky and Jerry Fodor attacking AI, and Roger
Schank and Terry Winograd defending.  Schank was working at the time on
programs for natural language comprehension, and the critics focussed
on his scheme for representing (in a computer) the higgledy-piggledy
collection of trivia we all know and somehow rely on when deciphering
ordinary speech acts, allusive and truncated as they are.  Chomsky and
Fodor heaped scorn on this enterprise, but the grounds of their attack
gradually shifted in the course of the match.  It began as a
straightforward, "first principles" condemnation of conceptual error
-- Schank was on one fool's errand or another -- but it ended with a
striking concession from Chomsky: it just might turn out, as Schank
thought, that the human capacity to comprehend conversation (and more
generally, to think) was to be explained in terms of the interaction
of hundreds or thousands of jerry-built gizmos -- pseudo-
representations, one might call them -- but that would be a shame, for
then psychology would prove in the end not to be "interesting."  There
were only two interesting possibilities, in Chomsky's mind: psychology
could turn out to be "like physics" -- its regularities explainable as
the consequences of a few deep, elegant, inexorable laws -- or
psychology could turn out to be utterly lacking in laws, in which case
the only way to study or expound psychology would be the novelist's
way (and he much preferred Jane Austen to Roger Schank, if that were
the enterprise).

<p>A vigorous debate ensued among the panelists and audience, capped by
an observation from Chomsky's MIT colleague, Marvin Minsky, one of the
founding fathers of AI, and founder of MIT's AI Lab: "I think only a
humanities professor at MIT could be so oblivious to the third
interesting possibility: psychology could turn out to be like
engineering."<br>[...]&raquo;</blockquote>
