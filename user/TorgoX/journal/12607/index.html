<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;Although it decriminalises the possession of small amounts of marijuana, the new bill [under consideration in Canada] will also crack down on people who actually grow pot, even a few plants. The maximum sentence for growing cannabis will double under the bill from seven to 14 years.
<p>[...]Last week, John Walters, the White House director of drug-control policy, warned that policing the flow of pot from Canada could dramatically slow down traffic at the border. 
<p>He said that in Canada, smoking pot would soon be seen as akin to jaywalking, and the Canadians could pay a heavy price - in terms of lost trade - for going soft on drugs. 
<p>"We'll respond to the threat," he told a US cable news show. "What we have to do is protect Americans and right now, this is out of control."&raquo;<p
>--<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,968799,00.html">"Pot plan has critics fuming"</a> </blockquote>
OUT OF (MY) CONTROL!<p>Man, I have memories, dim tho they may be, of a time when the dyspeptic old madmen in the US government hadn't yet totally committed to the notion that the rest of the world as wrong, a mistake, and a "threat".  It's like medieval imperial China, except without all the nice lacquerwork and brocade.

I can try, but I doubt I'll win any votes with my campaign pledge of "I'll see you in hell!!!".

You've got my vote! But, then, how could I <i>not</i> vote for someone in favor of orbiting laser vaporization sattelites?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

for the water flushed through it when I burst out laughing at this. At least in the next election I can get some humor from imagining W spontaneously launching into "I'll see you in hell!!!" (the inevitable nightmare: people still vote for him).<br> <br>Thanks!

Something that gets pointed out on CBC radio reports regularly (but ignored by the Bush administration) is that the proposed Canadian regulations are still much more stringent than those in a number of U.S. states - and no attempt has been made to restrict border crossing from those states into the more moral rest of the union.
