<p>Dear Log,
<p>Fontographer continues to frustrate me.  I have been using this program on and off for <em>years</em> and still have no sense of confidence in using it.  I just sort of dumbly poke at it to get it to do anything, and it works except when it doesn't.  I sense that the vagarities of TTF implementations are at least part of the problem.
<p>Errant thought: I wonder if a save-as-Pod plugin for AbiWord would be helpful and/or interesting to have.  (If only I knew enough C to make such a thing.) But then, why not just save as HTML and then feed it thru <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/sburke/Pod-HTML2Pod/">html2pod</a>?
You <em>do</em> know about html2pod, don't you?
<p>My amusement yesterday was running Regedit and deleting all but one or two ShellNew entries.  That comprises the extent of my mastery of Regedit or the MSWin registry in general.
<p>My bedtime reading lately is <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0394711955">Among the Believers</a></cite>.  Nice sense of prose.
I keep trying to read this other book of (translated) primary texts from the Stoic philosophers, but it's almost as bad as badly translated Buddhist logicians -- endless multiclausal sentences about whether the inseparability of elements and space and form implicates an actual relationship between them, or not, or what, zzzzzzzzzz.</p>

Were you to use TweakUI it would have been much quicker, and you could do much more.
