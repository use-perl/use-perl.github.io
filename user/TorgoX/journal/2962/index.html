<h2>My Ogg Statement</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-02-19T19:09:02</h3>
Ogg doesn't have nearly the same support that MP3 does.  I don't have a pure Perl module to handle tags and other info; I don't have a good audio player for it on Mac OS; I don't have a good encoder for it on Mac OS.  My many custom command-line tools don't know Ogg.  And most people I give audio too can't use Ogg at this time.  It took me 20 minutes to play an Ogg file from an Ogg developer site, and I am relatively clued about this kind of thing.<br> <br>Ogg is nice.  But MP3 suits my needs perfectly (well, rather, Ogg has no real advantages over MP3 for my needs).  It's a better format, but I don't need "better": I cannot distinguish between SoundJam/iTunes at 160 kbps (with all the filtering turned off) and CDs on any speakers or headphones I try, and HDs are cheap.  So those people who ask me to use Ogg are asking me to greatly decrease my ability to use the audio files -- at best lowering my efficiency significantly, at worst taking away functionality I have now -- for no real gain.<br> <br>Oh, but this nebulous "freedom" is the gain.  But as already noted, I use Mac OS, so I don't buy into that religion.<br> <br>And then there's the idea that Ogg can be updated as I go along or somesuch; nice, but that's a future benefit, not a current one, and by the time I care, maybe I'll already have switched to Ogg (or something better).<br>
