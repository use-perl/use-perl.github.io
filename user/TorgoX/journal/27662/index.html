<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;Eiler's life as its mayor and sole resident is
surreal. Once a year
she raises taxes from herself to keep the four street lights on and a
few other basic amenities going. She runs the town's only business,
the Monowi Tavern, and lives in the only remaining habitable
building. She grants her own liquor licence and elects herself
mayor. Her customers come off the highway that runs through Monowi or
from nearby towns.

<p>[...]In fact Monowi's been in decline since shortly after it was
founded. That is true of a lot of the Great Plains. Although settlers
flocked to the land, the soil is too thin for quality farming and is
soon exhausted.
<p>[...]The newest concept is a 'rewilding' of the area with animals from
Africa such as elephants and camels, returning the plains to the
Pleistocene ecosystem before humans arrived.&raquo;<blockquote

>"Population 1: the town that's been reclaimed by the
prairie"</a>:   As rural economies collapse, communities across America are being
deserted, as Paul Harris discovers in Monowi, Nebraska</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile...
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;
We took off with 17 casualties, but the Pentagon only officially
counts nine of them. This is one more way they play down the human
cost. Only those injured in battle are included in statistics. The air
force man who collapsed with severe pneumonia in Afghanistan, the
National Guardsman with blackened fingers and deep burns from faulty
electrical kit in Iraq - they don't count, officially. Soldiers have
been crushed and paralysed by falling equipment, suffered long-term
injuries in overturned vehicles, but they're not in the figures.
<p>[...]The Bush supporters on the other side of the road jab their
fingers towards the opposing group. 'These are a bunch of communists
and Marxists. They hate everything about our country, they hate our
soldiers,' says one. When I suggest there is no proven link between
Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, another spits 'Moron' at me and
stomps away. On this side of the road they are far angrier. That's
probably because they are losing the argument.&raquo;<blockquote

>"Middle America asks: 'Did we give up our young so
cheaply?'"</a></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile...
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;
'What has been happening since August is that when people are being
picked up it is by people out of uniform, but who may turn up in
Ministry of the Interior vehicles or show MoI ID cards. Many of those
people are turning up with a bullet in the head.' 
<p>[...]as the disappearances have escalated in recent
months, so whatever small faith Sunnis had in Iraq's judicial process
has increasingly collapsed, falling back instead on the tribal code
permitting revenge killings.&raquo;<blockquote

>"Frontline police of new Iraq are waging secret war of
vengeance"</a></blockquote></blockquote>
Meanwhile...

<p><blockquote
>&laquo;When Murtha emotionally called Bush's Iraq policy 'a flawed policy
wrapped in illusion', he broke down in front of reporters and wept. He
also personally attacked leading White House officials for taking the
country into war when they themselves had avoided serving in Vietnam.
<p>Murtha, who served in the US Marines during that war, was called 'a
coward' by Republican Senator Jean Schmidt. Her comments provoked
uproar. The debate was suspended as one Democrat crossed the Senate's
centre aisle to lambast her. Other Democrats screamed 'pathetic' as
the debate descended into an ugly slanging match.&raquo;<blockquote
