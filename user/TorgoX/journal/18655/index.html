...it's already having a great effect on Perl 5 development. For example, in the deprecation of pseudohashes, and in the incorporation of the<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>//</tt> operator in 5.10.

<p>And useful (and usable) parts of Perl 6 *are* available already &ndash; in the form of Perl 5 modules like:

</p><ul>
<li>Perl6::Parameters</li>
<li>Perl6::Interpolators</li>
<li>Perl6::Currying</li>
<li>Perl6::Gather</li>
<li>Perl6::Placeholders</li>
<li>Perl6::Form</li>
<li>Perl6::Say</li>
<li>Perl6::Slurp</li>
<li>Perl6::Export</li>
</ul>

To say nothing of the way that my own on-going struggle to implement the Perl6::Rules module is uncovering opportunities for use to improve the robustness of the Perl 5 regex engine.

<p>And, as if all that isn't enough, the Perl 6 development effort has siphoned many of the more...err..."exuberant" folk from the P5P list, and thereby allowed P5P to function much more effectively.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>;-)</tt>

</p><p>Perl 5 took nearly a decade to design (if you consider Perls 1 through 4 to be prototypes). Perl 6 won't take that long, even though it's far more than twice as powerful. But it *does* take an enormous amount of time to get all the decisions right. And even more time to get them harmonious.

</p><p>We understand how frustrating that delay can be. It frustrates us too. But any project that's being designed and implemented almost entirely by unpaid volunteers, and worked on nearly exclusively in their spare cycles, is inevitably going to be executed at low priority and subject to endless interrupts.</p>

<p>That was never a "goal"; it's merely an observed outcome.

</p><p>And, of course, it *is* nonsensical to try and nail down the exact increase in "power". But given that Perl 6 adds features like:
</p><ul>
<li> hyperoperators</li>
<li> junctions (superpositions)</li>
<li> coroutines</li>
<li> strong typing</li>
<li> subroutine overloading</li>

<li> named parameters</li>
<li> currying</li>
<li> properties and traits</li>
<li> opaque classes</li>
<li> hierarchical construction and destruction</li>
<li> distributive dispatch</li>
<li> delegation</li>
<li> named rules</li>
<li> grammars</li>
<li> overlapping and exhaustive matching</li>
<li> named captures</li>
<li> parse-tree pruning</li>
<li> new operators</li>
<li> user-definable operators</li>
<li> macros</li>
<li> submethods</li>
<li> chained comparisons</li>
<li> a switch statement</li>
<li> full OO exception handling</li>
<li> state variables</li>
<li> polymorphic inner classes</li>
<li> universal aliasing mechanism</li>
<li> multi-versioning support</li>
<li> module meta-data and introspection</li>
<li> lexical exporting</li>
<li> declarative exporting</li>
<li> new aggregative I/O commands ('say' and 'slurp')</li>
<li> POD introspection within programs</li>
<li> autotopicalization in numerous contexts</li>
<li> smart-matching</li>
<li> regex matching against input streams</li>
</ul>

<p>it doesn't seem entirely unreasonable to describe the power available to the average user as having more than doubled.

</p><p>Nevertheless, thanks for pointing out the absurdity of trying to quantify such improvements.</p>

<p>Actually, I don't think that's appropriate at all. I doubt that many here would seriously argue that C or sh is actually easier to program in than Perl 5 (for most tasks). And yet Perl 5 has far more features than C or sh.

</p><p>How much is "in a language" is very close to irrelevant. What matters is *what* is in it. That's why DMR says "<b>some</b> that do". It's not the magnitude of the feature vector; it's the direction it's pointing.

</p><p>Larry has often pointed out his "Waterbed Theory of Programming Complexity" (try googling for it) and that definitely applies to this quote.
Whilst DMR's observation might make sense when applied to <b>some</b> "large magnitude" languages, which increase complexity at one level without  substantially decreasing it elsewhere, I think Larry has consistently avoided that mistake, and has almost always chosen a direction for Perl's feature vector than *does* make the higher levels of programming easier.

</p><p>And, after two decades of getting that direction right, doesn't it seem unlikely that he's now going to turn around and head off in some random counterproductive direction. Hasn't he earned a little more of our trust than that?</p>

</i> </div></blockquote>

<p>But that's precisely how we *are* developing Perl 6. Almost all of
   the new features we're folding in are either taken directly from, or
   refactored from syntheses of, existing modules or programming idioms.
   Here's a partial list of the rigorously field-tested modules whose
   useful functionality we are incrementally incorporating into Perl 6 at some level:

</p><ul>
<li> Attribute::Handlers</li>
<li> Attribute::Types</li>
<li> Class::Contract</li>
<li> Class::Delegation</li>
<li> Class::DispatchToAll</li>
<li> Class::MethodMaker (et al)</li>
<li> Class::Multimethods</li>
<li> Class::Roles</li>
<li> Coro</li>
<li> Error</li>
<li> Exporter::Simple (et al)</li>
<li> Fatal</li>
<li> File::Slurp (et al)</li>
<li> Filter::Simple</li>
<li> Hook::LexWrap (et al)</li>
<li> IO::File (et al)</li>
<li> Inline</li>
<li> Inline::Files</li>
<li> Lexical::Alias</li>
<li> List::Util</li>
<li> Math::BigInt (et al)</li>
<li> Memoize</li>
<li> NEXT</li>
<li> PDL</li>
<li> POE</li>
<li> Params::Validate</li>
<li> Parse::RecDescent</li>
<li> PerlIO</li>
<li> Quantum::Superpositions</li>
<li> Readonly (et al)</li>
<li> Regexp::Common</li>
<li> Regexp::Fields (et al)</li>
<li> Sub::Lexical</li>
<li> Switch</li>
<li> Text::Reform</li>
<li> Tie::SecureHash</li>
<li> Time::HiRes</li>
<li> Unicode::Normalize</li>
</ul>

Not to mention all the parts of Perl 6 that we're specifically
prototyping and experimenting with in Perl 5:

<ul>
<li> Perl6::Interpolators</li>
<li> Perl6::Parameters</li>
<li> Perl6::Currying</li>
<li> Perl6::Export</li>
<li> Perl6::Form</li>
<li> Perl6::Gather</li>
<li> Perl6::Placeholders</li>
<li> Perl6::Rules</li>
<li> Perl6::Say</li>
<li> Perl6::Slurp</li>
<li> Perl6::Variables</li>
<li> Perl6::Binding</li>
<li> Perl6::Classes</li>
</ul>

<p>So why (you ask) not leave them as modules? Why bring them into the
   core of the language? Because the existence of these module point to
   deficiencies in the incremental design of the language, or gaps in
   the language's support for the way people actually want to program.
   And because many of these behaviours are nearly impossible to get
   right in an external module; they need core integration and support.

<p>And thank heavens it does. We need skeptics to keep us honest.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>;-)</tt>

</p><p>But I probably write more Perl 6 than anyone else (even Larry).
   And every time I do, I'm astonished at how much easier even everyday
   tasks are in Perl 6. "Twice as powerful" isn't meant to be invidious.
   I love Perl 5. But it wasn't until I started coding in Perl 6 that I
   realized how awkward and difficult Perl 5 can still be. And how it
   doesn't have to be that way. Switching back from Perl 6 to Perl 5 now
   feels about the same to me as switching back from Perl 5 to C.

<p>My experience so far is that Perl 6 is unquestionably a satisfying
   language to program in. And whenever I find it isn't, I report that
   to Larry and we fix it so it is.
