<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;Until last year, an international campaign to rid the planet of polio had proceeded almost flawlessly. Numbers of cases had dropped from more than 300,000 a year to fewer than a thousand. A disease that in the 1990s was found in 125 nations was confined to a few pockets of Asia, and to Africa where most cases are concentrated into parts of Nigeria, Niger and Egypt.
<p>But in 2003, anti-Western hostility erupted among Muslims in northern Nigeria's Kano region. They claimed vaccines were tainted with HIV and poisons to make women infertile and refused to cooperate with doctors.
<p>'All kinds of rumours were going around,' said Jonathan Majiyagbe, a Kano resident and a past president of Rotary International which has played a key role in funding the polio eradication programme. 'Some clerics made all sorts of wild accusations.'&raquo;
<p>--<a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1396500,00.html"
>"Scourge of polio returns to Africa"</a></blockquote>

"Cleric" is a very special word we use for Moslem priests.  It means "priest", but
they say they're not priests, so we have to use a word that means "priest" without
<em>being</em> the word "priest".
<p>If this makes sense to you, then congratulations, you now live in the 13th century.  A
faith-healer will be by in the morning to cast out the demons from your vaccinations.</p>
