<div class="span8">
<p>Dear Log,

<p>Today was given over to JavaScript and vacuuming.  When I wasn't
vacuuming, I was leisurely reading <cite><a
href="http://hop.perl.plover.com/">Higher-Order Perl</a></cite> and
writing some more <a href="http://interglacial.com/hoj/">notes on
translating it all to JavaScript</a>.

<p>Today's interesting stuff was
mainly yet more cases where the Perl code has <code>push @foo,
bar(...)</code> where <code>bar</code> might (directly or indirectly)
return an empty list, or one item, or several; and, to make things
even more interesting, some of the values returned were arrayrefs, so
that I couldn't just say that I'll array-deref whatever values come
back.  It's not a case of the Perl being bad, or the JavaScript being bad;
instead, the trouble is the subtleness of the problems that arise from
the apparently safe translation of <code>push @foo, bar(),</code>
as <code>foo.push(bar())</code>.  In a day or two, I'll put it
all up at <a href="http://interglacial.com/hoj/">the usual place</a>.

<p>Then, as I was poking at
<a href="http://interglacial.com/rss/">My RSSs Of Interest</a>,
it occurred to me that
<a href="http://interglacial.com/user/sburke/stuff/pretty_rss.html">my
XSL tricks</a> do improve things by expressing
&lt;lastBuildDate&gt;Mon, 23 May 2005 08:57:22
GMT&lt;/lastBuildDate&gt;
as "Last feed update: Mon, 23 May 2005 08:57:22 GMT".  But, it
occurred to me that it's not exactly effortless for people to look at that and say "oh, that just updated", or "that was like ten hours ago"

<p>So I thought
how I've already
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/TorgoX/journal/24272">used a
bit of JavaScript</a> to moregoodify the data in an RSS feed, and
<a href="http://interglacial.com/hoj/hoj.js">a bit of
date-wrangling in JavaScript</a>; so I might as well combine the two past approaches and
write
<a href="http://interglacial.com/rss/lastmod_ago.js">some
JavaScript</a> to convert  "Mon, 23 May 2005 08:57:22 GMT" to a Date
object and then to figure out how long ago it was, and then to express
that as an approximate time-interval, like
"Last feed update: about 9 hours ago".

<p>Then I just got crazy and put some other data off into the title="..." attribute
of the wrapper-element around the "ago" phrase, so that mousing over "9 hours ago" shows something like "Sun 22 May 2005 04:58:32 PM ADT  (Mon, 23 May 2005 08:58:32 GMT)" (modulo your locale and timezone, etc).

The title I'm getting is "Sun 22 May 2005 08:57:22 PM EDT (Mon, 23 May 2005 08:57:22 GMT)". The difference between EDT and GMT is 4 hours, not 12. But perhaps it's some other EDT you're referring to. (Plus it's confusing to use AM/PM for the EDT times and 24-hour time (apparently) for the GMT.)

That's very strange.  All the time math is done in your browser, which should ideally know its correct TZ offset.  But I'll poke around a bit and see if I'm parsing the date wrong or something.  What browser are you using?

Firefox on Linux. That was at work. I just tried it at home, also Firefox on Linux, and it's the same.

Argh! If the string begins with '0', parseInt() assumes it's octal, and '08' isn't a valid octal number and thus returns 0.  Maybe subtracting 0 (as opposed to adding 0, which will just give string concatentaion) is better than using parseInt() when you're converting strings to numbers.

D'oh, and just days <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/TorgoX/journal/24787" title="perl.org">after I wrote this!!!</a perl.org>

<p>It seems that if I pass an explicit ",10" to parseInt(), it doesn't do that crazy octalification thing.  There, <a href="http://interglacial.com/rss/lastmod_ago.js" title="interglacial.com">fixedified</a interglacial.com>!</p>

<h2>not in HOP</h2>

I haven't even finished HOP yet, but I just digested a large <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/jscript4/" title="oreilly.com">Javascript tome</a oreilly.com> for work reasons. JS has a few higher-ordery features that Perl doesn't.

<p>An interesting twist on eval, Function() creates a function reference out of an array of strings.</p>

<p>And this JS 1.5 syntax, which gives an anonymous closure a temporary name so it can refer to itself. </p>

    <blockquote> <div>var f = function fact(x) { if (x &lt;=1) return 1; else return x*fact(x-1); }</div> </blockquote>

<p>Despite appearances, there is no fact(). That was just a name for use during the definition of f.</p> <p><p>I have tried to do this in Perl and failed. Someone told me one could do it with a Y combinator.</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:not in HOP</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TorgoX/">TorgoX</a> on 2005-05-25T02:21:13</h3>
One is tempted to do this:<blockquote> <div> <tt>my $f = sub { ($_[0] &lt;=1) ? 1 : ( $_[0] * $f-&gt;($_[0] - 1)) };<br>print $f-&gt;(4);</tt> </div> </blockquote>But that doesn't work, because sub is defined outside the scope of $f.  So you've got to do this:<blockquote> <div> <tt>my $f;<br>$f = sub { ($_[0] &lt;=1) ? 1 : ( $_[0] * $f-&gt;($_[0] - 1)) };<br>print $f-&gt;(4);</tt> </div> </blockquote>That works!
<p>(GC note: now $f and that sub constitute a circular data structure, so you need to do $f='whatever'; (or just undef($f)) to break the circularity.)</p>

<h3><a href="/user/brev/">brev</a> on 2005-05-25T03:06:55</h3>
Huh. Now I wonder why what I was trying didn't work. That seems relatively straightforward, with the slight inconvenience of defining the variable first.<br/><br/>Callee was another weirdness I noticed too. Thanks.

<h2>And with arguments.callee</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TorgoX/">TorgoX</a> on 2005-05-25T02:29:20</h3>
Also:<blockquote> <div> <tt>var f = function (x) { if (x &lt;=1) return 1; else return x * arguments.callee(x-1); };</tt> </div> </blockquote>
