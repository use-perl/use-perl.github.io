<p>Dear All,
<p>Here are two, vaguely unrelated, questions that I am earnestly and eagerly searching for answers for:
<ul>
<li>In Firebird Mozilla, how would I go about writing a bit of JavaScript (to be put in my user.js file) that would, every time I load an HTML page, set an attribute "_domain" on the root node of the DOM tree; the domain value would just be the hostname from the page's URL.  I want this so I can write my own little stylesheet do-dads (in my chrome/userContent.css) that would target some sites that I commonly visit and that I really want to alter my personal view of -- notably making them a bit easier on my poor-excuse-for-eyes by forcing a particular text size and text colors, etc etc.  (I know there's features for forcing ALL text on ALL web sites to be a particular size and color, but that's disastrous in most cases.)
<li>I'd really like to learn how to write Firebird extensions -- I have some decent i18n/interface ideas I'd like to try out, and I think people would find them useful.  But I simply can't find a page that describes the process of writing and binding a bunch of JS functions, and making a dist out of them.
</ul>
I would simply ask a Firebird developer these things, but I don't know any who aren't so maddeningly overworked at smashing bugs that they could ever answer email from a random unknown person asking for help.  Does anyone here know anyone who could lend me a hand and answer my occasional questions about these sorts of things?  I've written <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/sburke/">a bit of Perl software</a> in my day, and I expect that I can pull off some interesting stuff in Firebird.</p>

<h2>Web Site makes this easier</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2003-09-27T15:00:42</h3>
It might be worth contacting the webmasters of the site in questions.  There's a technique I saw doing the rounds a while ago that involves putting an attribute <i>id="www-mysite-com"</i> on the &lt;html&gt; element.  It's a small and generally non-intrusive change.  It does, however, let you key CSS selectors off of it, for example:<blockquote><div> <tt>#www-mysite-com p { font-size: 120%; }</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>You can see an example of this at <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/" title="mezzoblue.com">http://www.mezzoblue.com/</a mezzoblue.com>.
