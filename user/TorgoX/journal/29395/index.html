<div class="span8">
<p>Dear Log,
<p>So, <a href=
"http://www.rightbrain.com/pages/books.html"
>PostScript</a> is
<a href=
"http://www.math.ubc.ca/people/faculty/cass/graphics/text/www/index.html"
>hard</a>.  It's a stack language, and that made it ideal for what it
needed to do decades ago; but in these days when people
(understandably) are no more familiar with writing Forth than they are
with coding in a hex assembler, it's just too damned hard to write by
hand.

<p>It sure would be nice to have an easier language that can do the
same thing as PostScript -- i.e., write out pictures/text/etc. in the
printer.

<p>There have been some decent hacks at improving this situation:
<ul><li><a href=
"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/lang/lisp/code/io/plisp/0.html"
>Plisp</a> aims to translate Common Lisp to a PostScript
document; but is abandonware, and requires having a CL interpreter to
do the translation.
<li><a href=
"http://compilers.iecc.com/comparch/article/93-01-152">PdB</a> aims to
translate a subset of C to PostScript (with a translator written in
C), but it's apparently buggy, half-done, and abandoned.
<li>And <a href=
 "http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/educa/logo/logo2ps/"
 >Logo2PS</a> and <a
 href="http://www.scsh.net/resources/fps.html">Functional
PostScript</a> [the latter being a Scheme library]
don't actually translate Logo/Scheme to PostScript, but instead
provide graphics/text primitives that output PostScript code.
</ul>
<p>While these are all admirable, they all seem to me half-hearted, or
maybe seven-eighths hearted.  And I want to do things just a bit better: to implement
a Lisp interpreter (possibly later a Logo interpreter) entirely
<em>in</em> PostScript, so that it won't need a separate translator
program-- instead, you would just send Lisp code (prefaced by the
interpreter) right to the printer, and/or view it with GhostScript.

<p>I'm "almost done" with it (i.e., 90% done, which leaves
only 90% left to do), and I've already named it:  Skreeth.
One part <a href=
 "http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-26.html#%_sec_4.1.1"
 >Scheme</a> (altho this isn't a straight Scheme implementation),
one part <a href=
 "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Diamond"
 >Screech</a>,
one part <a href=
 "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaths_of_Strasbourg"
 >proto-Romance</a> for "writes" (cf Latin <em>scribet</em> and Old French
<em>escri&#x163;</em>) and one part, uh,
<a href=
 "http://farscape-1.com/index.php?title=Skreeth"
 >Skreeth</a>.

<p>It has been very interesting working through
 <a href=
 "http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-26.html#%_sec_4.1.1"
 >SICP's</a> discussion of implementing a full-featured Lisp
using only a simpler Lisp -- because there are interesting matches
between PostScript and an even well-developed Lisp (for example,
PostScript has invisible garbage collection, and has distinct types for arrays/vectors, booleans, strings,
names/symbols, reals, integers, hashes, and a null/nil/undef object),
and yet PostScript has only global variables -- which means sensible
recursion is out, which means the recursive eval/apply in SICP has run into trouble.  Implementing/faking local variables in PostScript has been
an especially fun use of PostScript's wide powers of introspection.  It has been a great exercise in implementation.

<p>It has also been a wonderful tour of PostScript's most bizarre
features -- for example, there's no structure corresponding to
<code>if(X) {a} elsif(Y) {b} elsif...</code> -- instead, you get to
have visibly nested code that corresponds to:

<pre>  if(X) {
    a
  } else {
    if(Y) {
      b
    } else {
      ...
    }
  }</pre>

...which gets REALLY annoying after about four conditions.  And
there's no switch/case/cond statement in the language.  Making a
hacky one is esay -- making one that won't trip you up in weird ways,
is <em>not</em> easy.

<p>And the stack... the stack!... it never ceases to amaze and appall.
It starts out great with things like "/inch {72 mul} def", but it
quickly turns very scary.  It's the perfect computational embodiment
of the old <a href="http://www.xtheband.com/">X</a>
lyric "this is the game that moves as you play".

<p>I'll post more here as I get this thing more ready for people to
look at, but at the moment I'm just dumping raw stuff in
<a href="http://interglacial.com/skreeth/">here</a>.

<p>As a peek, I'm expecting that this PostScript code...
<pre>297 421 translate
0 .1 400 {
  dup dup sqrt 4 div 0 360 arc fill
  137.50775 rotate
} for
showpage</pre>

<p>...will come out something like this in Skreeth:
<pre>(page
  (translate 297 421)
  (for (i 0 400 .1)
    (arc i i (/ (sqrt i) 4) 0 360)
    (fill)
    (rotate 137.50775)
  )
)</pre>

<p>I'm not exactly a devotee of Lisp; but at the moment, given PostScript's limited string-manipulation powers and my own feebleness at implementing lexers/parsers, Lisp seems about the only choice.  Lisp is not the friendliest language ever, but it's a step up from PostScript.</p>

<h2>Fantastic!</h2>

That's all really interesting... Converting Lisp to Postscript seems almost trivial, just using some First In Last Out inversion...<br><br>Anyway, I've seen your source code, It's all nice reading... but can you recommend a way to run it, apart from having and using a Postscript printer? Ghostscript? If so, how would that work? I've never used Ghostscript for anything other than processing/converting/showing pictures.

You just do "gs skreeth.psl" at a shell prompt to run the code.  But for the moment that'll just run all the self-tests in the code and dump you at a GS prompt (where you can enter further PostScript commands).  Enter "quit" to exit.

<h2>Fabulous!</h2>

And it will of course be trivial to implement perl6 in Lisp, thus giving us perl on printers<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
