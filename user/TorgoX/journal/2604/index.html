<p><p>Weird dreams last night:
<br>I dreamt I was at Julia Louis Dreyfus's wedding in Vegas; but I left in a huff because, even though there was vegetarian tsimmis, the tables were on a flatbed that kept going on the freeway, which I found unnerving.  
My cellphone calls to Julia didn't improve things, even tho I threatened to throw her luggage (just a purse and a white leather miniskirt) onto the freeway.
<br>And beforehand, one of the local Vegas whores, a junkie shemale who claimed her name was "Pepper" and/or "Banjo", was being a pest too.
<br>So I ended up having to drive all the way home from Vegas, which somehow took no perceptable time or mileage at all.
<p>And I dreamt I bought some dishwasher soap and then noticed that the label claimed it could also double for shampoo.  I was dubious.
<p>And then I dreamt I was stuffing a pillow full of caviar.
<p>I should get David Lynch's people on the phone.  This is all great material -- very high-concept.

Wow...wish I had dreams like that.
<p>
On the other hand, I once had a shampoo that doubled as a body wash, and it was very, very handy.  One little tube to take with me into the shower or to the Y or whatever.
</p><p>
Shampoo/dish soap...perhaps not as immediately handy, but in the long run it would save packaging.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<h2>Tsimmis?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2002-02-04T18:30:44</h3>
Julia had vegetarian tsimmis at her wedding?  Were there any other signs that this was a Saturday night wedding, or was this just a fluke?

No, in fact, it was broad daylight, altho actually not hot, which is probably odd for a sunny day in Las Vegas.  I didn't have a good sense for what day of the week it was; but then in real life, I often don't.
<p>And actually, it looked like just a nice fruktkompott to me, but I distinctly heard someone call it tsimmis.</p>

<h2>Magic soaps.</h2>
