<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;The next day, Hughes goes with the other embedded journalists to the banks of the Euphrates to search for insurgents. It winds up being a 14-hour day, during which they find three Kalashnikovs and a bag containing a severed head. On the way back to base camp, a truck in their convoy is attacked.

<p>That night, Burns files a story in which he draws comparisons between Iraq and Vietnam. "Vietnam," he wrote, "is rarely mentioned among the troops. It is considered a bad talisman among those men and women, who privately admit to fears that this war could be lost."

<p>Another <cite>New York Times</cite> reporter, Dexter Filkins, has just returned from two weeks of covering the battle for Fallujah. He was with a company of 150 U.S. Marines. A quarter of the company was killed or wounded during the October offensive there. "I thought, my god, what have I signed up for?" he says, remembering the hours of combat. "It made everything else I've covered look like a tea party. You know, I'm a writer -- and words failed me completely."&raquo;

Meanwhile...
<p><blockquote>&laquo;The survey also indicated for the first time that dislike of Mr Bush is translating into a dislike of Americans in general.
<p>[...]Mr Bush's victory was viewed positively in only three of the 21 countries: the Philippines, Poland and India&raquo;
