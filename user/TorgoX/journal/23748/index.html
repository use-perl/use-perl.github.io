<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;The Afghan government privately shares Nadery's fears. One minister, who
asked not to be named, said, "Washington holds Afghanistan up to the
world as a nascent democracy and yet the US military has deliberately
kept us down, using our country to host a prison system that seems to be
administered arbitrarily, indiscriminately and without accountability."
<br>[...]
<br>The floating population of "ghost detainees", according to US and UK
military officials, now exceeds 10,000.
<br>[...]
<br>On September 26 2002, Maher Arar, a 34-year-old Canadian computer
scientist, was arrested at New York's JFK airport as a result of a
paper-thin evidential chain.&nbsp; Syrian-born Arar told us, "I was
pulled aside by US immigration at 2pm.&nbsp; I told them I had a
connecting flight to Montreal where I had a job interview."&nbsp; However,
Arar was "rendered" in a private jet, via Washington, Portland and Rome,
landing in Amman, Jordan, where he was held at what a Jordanian source
described as a US-run interrogation centre.&nbsp; From there, he was
handed over to Syria, the country he had left as a 17-year-old
boy.&nbsp; He says he spent the next 12 months being tortured and in
solitary confinement, unaware that someone he barely knew had named him
as a terrorist.
<br>[...]
<br>Arar, who was eventually released in October 2003 after a
Syrian court threw out a coerced confession in which he said he had been
trained by al-Qaida, told us, "I am not a terrorist.&nbsp; I don't know
anyone who is.&nbsp; But the tolerant Muslim community I come from here
in Canada has become vitriolic and demoralised."&raquo;
	<blockquote>--<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/afghanistan/story/0,1284,1440836,00.html">"'One huge US jail'"</a></blockquote></blockquote>

I wonder what those US-run torture camps do with all the corpses.  Boy, it's a good thing none of them are white people!
<p>Freedom is on the march, Texas/Pinochet witchhunt style.  But it's okay, because there have been elections in Iraq.  You know, like Haiti has.</p>
