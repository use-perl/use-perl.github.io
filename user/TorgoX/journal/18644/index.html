<p>Dear Log,
<p>I muttered and shuffled all yesterday (Tuesday) about the
XML::RSS::Timing(Bot) stuff, and decided to get my mind
off it by going and taking pictures of 
<a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-05-04_gran_turismo/">the
first cruise ship of the season</a>.  Click click click click
click click click.

<p>While I was downtown, I looked over the side of the docks and
saw that the water was oddly murky. I went and looked closer and saw
that it wasn't murk, it was spajillions of tiny jellyfish.  I tried getting some shots of them, but it didn't come out well -- bad glare and choppy water.
But
<a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-05-04_flourish/">some
other pics in the set</a> came out well.  (BTW, the license
plate on <a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-05-04_flourish/dog_roadster">this
car</a> was "1".  Alaskan humor.  Ar ar ar.)

<p>Today the water was calmer
<a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-05-05_aquatica/">and
I got some better pics</a> of the seething sea life.


<p>Last night, I had an idea about the TimingBot thing just as I
was getting to bed, and so I spent all night half-asleep and thinking about it.
At about 8am I finally woke up and scribbled out some code so I could
finally get some real sleep.  That freed my Paxil-addled brain to
return to its regularly scheduled programming: Since I had earlier seen someone
sing a few seconds of <a href="http://ingeb.org/songs/nessundo.html">"Nessun dorma"</a>
("nobody is sleeping"), my primitive meaty brain made me dream about
<em>a new word:</em> "nessunpossible", meaning something that works in theory
but which nobody could/will actually learn to deal with.
(Example: "DSSSL is nessunpossible.")


<p>Further accomplishments today: discovered a thrift store nearby.  Full of strange, strange, things.  Many near-mint-condition CB radios for $5.  Hot air corn poppers.  Video adapters for Apple 2C's.  Romance novels.  Crap.  But, as this is Alaska and not one of those grubby 49 states "down south", the thrift store crap was all spotless, and tidily organized on well-lit shelves.
