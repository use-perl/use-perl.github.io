<p>Dear Log,
<blockquote>On the jukebox: Radiohead, "Nobody Does It Better"</blockquote>
<p>I found a bookstore that's been craftily hidden just around the corner
from me for years. Sneaky, that. They had <em>two</em> copies of the
book no-one else in the state had: Shaughnessy's text and translation of the
Mawangdui <cite>Yijing</cite> manuscripts! And the copies were used, so
half-price!  It is a happytime.

<p>I walked in the store, found the right section, and started
looking thru their Yijing stuff.  It was on the bottom shelf, so
I sat down crosslegged on the floor.

<p>Immediately, as if by radio dispatch, a very old black cat (with that
thinning hair over the eyes, up to the ears, which I always think of as
a Siamese thing) walked directly up to me, and directly onto me, sat in
my lap, and immediately fell asleep, purring. And drooling on my
trouser-knee.

<p>So I had to stay there a while, and flip thru the books that were
within arm's reach, eventually finding the Shaughnessy books. Eventually I had to get on with the day, so I slowly
tried getting up. The cat wanted no part of this; he suppressed me with claws and mind-control. But it got up eventually went
elsewhere, probably to find a CPU to sleep on.

<p>Note to self: become fabulously rich, and then buy one of my alma maters a new library building, with reading rooms stocked with purring cats and comfortable couches.
<p>There is some precedent for this: my undergrad U had a dog that would walk around campus.  I think it was one of the frat's mascots.  His name was Banta, and he always wore a scarf, and always seemed to be <em>going</em> someplace. On his own. Running errands?  Going to class?  Beer run?</p>

<h2>What Is It With Bookstores And Cats?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chaoticset/">chaoticset</a> on 2002-03-10T13:17:59</h3>
As much as I think them an affront to humanity as a whole, I like several individual cats.  They're like certain types of friends -- they have that look in their eyes that says, "What can I get from this one?" but even those friends can be good to see sometimes.
<p>
I'm curious, though -- a bookstore in the area (I can't remember the name right now, I want to call it Lippincotts) has, you guessed it, a black cat.  Coincedence?  Or <em>are the cats trying to absorb knowledge for dastardly purposes</em>?</p>



<h2>You could call it....</h2>

Puss-n-Books.  Oh, wait, that's been <a href="http://www.ironfrog.com/libcats/press/list.html" title="ironfrog.com">used</a ironfrog.com>.  (It's also the name of a bookstore in Redmond.)
