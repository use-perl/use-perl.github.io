<p>Dear Log,

<p>In the newly localized Apach3::MP3, I had a bit where it generated the "Apache::MP3 was written &lt;a href='...'>by Lincoln D. Stein&lt;/a>" by doing a lookup on a key for "Apache::MP3 was written " and then a lookup for "by Lincoln D. Stein" and then just doing VAL1, a({href=>'...'}, VAL2).  Something felt quite wrong about this, but I figured "feh, I'll think of something better later."


<p>The problem arose with Irish (Gaelic).  There the translator said it /had/ to come out "Apache::MP3 by Lincoln D. Stein was written."  So I'm going thru all the lexicons changing it to three keys, one for text-before-Lincon, one for Lincoln-D-Stein, and one for text-after-Stein.

<p>And I guess I should ask all the current translators "Did you have to force things to fit into the structure 'Apache::MP3 was written' + 'by Lincoln D. Stein'?"
</p>

  Why not use a templating approach, wouldn't you have less special cases? <code>"${moduleName} par ${author} a &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;crit"</code> (or something more elaborate).

Did you read Sean's message?  Have you looked at localizing and Locale::Maketext?  It's all about templating.... and simple templating as such doesn't work, exactly because the word orders of different languages do not co-operate.<br>Or because expressions may separate and split, depending: just think of "c'est nest pas"...<br>Or because of plurals happen to be irregular?  Or because of gazillion other reasons.<br> <br>

  Yes, I did read Sean's message and I know that local problems are far harder than that. It's just that reading from the text I got the impression that Sean was using an approach a touch more ad hoc than that, which made me curious (in a conversational way, otherwise I'd have gone read the source).

Go pre-order the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596003129/" title="amazon.com"> <cite>Best of the Perl Journal</cite> volume</a amazon.com> where my article about localization will (re)appear.

  I definitely intend to get that book, especially as I subscribed to TPJ and only ever got one issue. I won't preorder though until I manage to get a job because in the meantime I have other priorities<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

I love that article.  I read it for kicks and laughs in addition to its lovely informational nature.  I grabbed that issue of TPJ to read on the crapper the other day and thought of you, Sean.<br> <br>Hmm... maybe I shouldn't have mentioned that.

I'm always glad that my articles "help people work on their qi".
<p>Also, it's the one TPJ article that prominently features the scenario of a developer having a <em>fainting spell</em>.</p>
