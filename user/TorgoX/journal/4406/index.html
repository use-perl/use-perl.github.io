<p>Dear Log,

largely composed of abducted children and led by a self-declared spiritual medium
who claims supernatural powers, began two weeks ago.&raquo;

Ya know, if the whole world is going to turn into a bad science fiction novel like this, I at least want some of that neat sci fi <em>technology.</em>  If not wormholes and nanotech, then at least decent electric cars and a jive-talking robot or two, okay?  And while we're at it, a decent minimum wage, and working mass transit, and also maybe some checks on total corporate control of society.<br>Also, no dumb people.<br>I like science fiction!!!
</p>

<h2>Dumb People</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2002-04-23T19:50:06</h3>
Science fiction does have dumb people on occasion. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553029835" title="amazon.com">Search the Sky</a amazon.com> by Pohl and Kornbluth is an interesting piece of early pulp sci fi that explores what it would be like to colonize a series of worlds that don't have sufficiently large populations to prevent inbreeding.  At least one of these worlds was full of dumb people.

<p>Hey, but did they have the chewing gum and 'da ClawR' [ apply hand to forehead in lion-like roaring motion - - rawr baby, it's da clawR! ]<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Oh, and don't forget the vette and gold chains for the guys...that's important for Friday night cruising of da clawR.</p>

<h2>Dumb People can be fun</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2002-04-23T21:58:29</h3>
Many years ago when I used to play a lot of Dungeons and Dragons, I had a character that I really liked.  He was a dwarf fighter - his strength was 18, but his intelligence was 5.  (I.e. he had the strength and intelligence of a bulldozer.)  His name was Stump.  Often, while the party be having a long discussion about the best way to proceed, Stump would fail an intelligence roll and suddenly start beating on a door or jumping into a possible trap.  That was often not the most sensible move, but it got things moving again.

Who cares if robots are starting to take over the world when you can see them through walls and launch rockets at them out of your arm?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
