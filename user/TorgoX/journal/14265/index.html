<p>Dear All,
<p>Books you must read:

<h2>Books, gotta luv 'em</h2>

<p> <em>Permutation City</em> was wonderful.  I haven't read the other two<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... yet.  Curse you for stealing more of my precious free time!</p>



<h2>Indeed</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/quidity/">quidity</a> on 2003-08-22T09:07:23</h3>
<p>Both Vinge and Egan are well worth the bother.  Not tried to other guy, but I'll look out for him.

</p><p>I especially liked the bit in PC at the start where the birth occurs.  And both PC and AR are simillar in that they start fairly small but get mad crazy aspirations of cosmic scope.  Vinge and Egan manage to pull this off quite well, but I do sometimes wonder if they might not have been better stopping before the scale got inflated quite so far.</p>

Much of the rest of Ken Grimwood's stuff is uneven, I'm told.  But his <cite>Replay</cite> is a keeper.

<p>BTW, I heard about both
<a href="http://freshair.npr.org/day_fa.jhtml?todayDate=11/14/2000" title="npr.org">Vinge </a npr.org>
(VINN-jee) and Egan from Dominus.  He's a supahstar.</p>

wow, I thought I was the only person who read Replay. I always wondered why someone didn't make a movie of it, it's great material.

I've only read two of Grimwood's books.  Replay I loved, and I thought Into the Deep was absolutely terrible.

I'm always on the lookout for new books to read, so it's nice to hear what other use.perl'ers are reading. I'd read the A FIRE UPON THE DEEP and A DEEPNESS IN THE SKY by Vinge (which are wonderful books)...but I didn't know about the reissue of the ACROSS REALTIME, so I'll be getting that.  The other titles are brand new to me, and have been dutifully noted, so I can pick them up some time.  Something about Perl people's reading choices is really interesting to me. If it wasn't for use.perl I don't think I would have ever discovered Gene Wolfe (from Autarch)...
