<p>Dear Log,
<p>So today, looking for a break from working on the book, I decided to skim the Apache/MP3.pm source to see what's involved in internationalizing it.  I didn't see anything terribly scary, so I replaced a phrase or two, and started a new module to contain the localization base class that Locale::Maketext needs.
<p>I typed the fateful words: <code>package Apache::MP3::L10N;</code>
<p>And an hour later... it all works!
<p>It's localized to English, and to my very clunky French -- I had to make up a term for "streaming" that might actually mean INSEMINATION.  But it's just a test until I get some native speakers to look at it.
<p>It turns out that there's only about thirty phrases in a complete %Lexicon for Apache::MP3!
<p>I'll shelve it until the book is turned in, and then I'll give the code a review, and then start looking for people who want to provide translations into various languages.
</p>

<h2>Streaming...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/darobin/">darobin</a> on 2002-04-21T02:12:10</h3>
<p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>...is not necessarily something that you'd want to translate, as it could very well be the same word in French. I'd love however to know what you picked that could be confused with insemination as I can't seem to guess. If you need a hand with the French, just ping me.
</p>

For "stream"/"streaming", I picked "semer"/"semence" -- pretty much just as a placeholder until I get the system up and running, and can get folks like you to do a real translation of that and the two dozen other menu items.
<p>For important languages that I don't actually know any computer-literate speakers of (like Thai, Korean, Polish) I think I'll poke thru the directory of<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.pm groups -- I bet that'll be fun!</p>
