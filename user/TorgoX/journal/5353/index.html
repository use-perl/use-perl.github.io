<p>Dear Log,
<p>In a story entitled <a
href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/kashmir/Story/0,2763,725968,00.
html">"India alert as nuclear war looms"</a>:

<blockquote>&laquo;The foreign secretary Jack Straw last night urged
Britons to leave India immediately because of its "dangerous" military
stand-off with its nuclear rival Pakistan and advised all nationals
against travelling to the region.<p>
The decision was taken after western intelligence
                          assessments warned that a new terrorist attack in
                          India or the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir
                          could spark war between the two countries,
                          leading to a nuclear exchange. 
<p><i>[...and now the part that just makes my eyes bug out:]</i><p>The
advice to Britons to leave India was voluntary because <b>the [UK]
government did not want to appear alarmist</b>, diplomatic sources
said.&raquo;</blockquote>

I can just picture embassy staff getting little notes in email from Mr. Straw: <em>Please remain perfectly calm as you flee an impending nuclear war.  There is nothing to be alarmed about.</em>
<p>Note to self: buy stock in companies developing radiation-resistant breeds of rice.  Also, eat lower on the food chain for a few hundred thousand years.</p>

Exactly how alert are nuclear war looms? Are they more alert than war looms powered by fossil fuels? And what does one weave on them anyway?  Wars, I suppose.

... is ready for <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,726432,00.html" title="observer.co.uk">airlifting remaining UK nationals out of India</a observer.co.uk>.  Creepy.

From the reports I get from the news, and from how the governments in Europe and America are acting, this seems scary.  But I just can't see how either Pakistan or India is on the brink of actually using nuclear weapons.<br>
