<p>Dear Log,
<p>I know <a href="http://www.acm.org/ubiquity/interviews/j_raskin_2.html">Jef Raskin</a> is supposed to be clever and anything (just ask him!), but I really really don't understand his <a href="http://humane.sourceforge.net/the/">T.H.E.</a> thing.  I just don't get it.  I look and look and it still just looks like a retarded version of microemacs from 1987.  Really not getting it here, folks.</p>

<h2>&quot;THE is not an editor&quot;</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dominus/">Dominus</a> on 2003-08-06T13:14:55</h3>
This would appear to address your question:<p>

<a href="http://humane.sourceforge.net/the/not_an_editor.html" title="sourceforge.net"> <cite>THE is not an editor</cite> </a sourceforge.net> </p><p>

Summary: They concentrated on editor stuff first because it's useful and important.  The reason it looks like an editor now is because it isn't finished yet.</p><p>

It took me way too long to find this document.  I first looked in the "Specifications" document, trying to find out what the project was about.
(I still don't know what the project is about.) Right at the top, it said:</p><p><blockquote><div>
	For an overall definition of The Humane Environment (abbreviated THE), see "So The Humane
            Environment isn't an editor, what is it?" on www.jefraskin.com.
</div></blockquote> <p>

The URL wasn't complete, and it wasn't hotlinked.  I typed it in and was treated to a gray page which informed me that I was being redirected to http://www.jefraskin.com (wasn't I already there?) and which then redirected me to http://humane.sourceforge.net/home/index.html, which was where I had just come from.  Then I got to wander around until I found the document I was looking for.</p><p>

 There could have been a hotlink.  Even if there wasn't a hotlink, the URL could have been complete.  Even if the URL was still incomplete, it could have pointed to the right site.</p><p>

If this is Jef Raskin's vaunted user interface design, I'll pass.  I wanted to find out what the project was about, but it's just been too difficult.</p><p>
