<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;Charles Jin, who arrived from China in 1984 to attend college, says he enjoys living in an area where he regularly comes in contact with Hispanics, whites and blacks, as well as Asians.
<p>At his dry cleaners in Temple City, he said, his customer base is so varied that he no longer addresses Asian people in Chinese unless he knows that's what they prefer.
<p>``So many Asian people look so much alike that they could be Japanese or Korean or Chinese,'' he said. ``So I speak to them all in English.''&raquo;<p

I got half correct<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but my sister is Korean, so that helped.  But really, with few exceptions (there are a few people that, to me, really look like they are from one country or another; and not just Asian people), I always have a hard time telling where people are from.

My only rule is if it's a woman and she's worrying ridiculous amounts of makeup, she's probably Korean, but other that it's pretty hard.<br> <br>My wife, who is Taiwanese, is told that she looks more Korean or Japanese, and in fact when we walked into a Korean restaurant in NYC, they started speaking to her in Korean, which was pretty funny.
