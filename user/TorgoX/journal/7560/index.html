<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;Software like MS Windows 95 is created simply by "C" and assembler
language programs which simply uses 1 and 0 and <I><B>universes like
ours are created simply by dashing TWO dissimilar but proper of
combination of tiny atomic particles of other dimensions.</B></I>
<I>(Something interesting happened <B>just before</B> dashing of tiny
particles)</I> A human body is created by dashing two dissimilar but
proper combination of tiny cells!! <I>(Something interesting happened
<B>just before</B> dashing of tiny cells)</I> Humans inherited the
properties of this universe. The universe you are currently living in
was NOT there - all the atoms inside the universe was not there and not
even TIME was existing!! Baby universe was born during big bang and
started expanding and kept growing. Even today our universe is still
expanding!! A person from another universe by name <B>'Brahma'</B>
created this universe you are currently living in. It is indeed possible
for man to create a new universe. Total number of universes that can be
created is <B>INFINITY</B> and similarly total number of operating
systems that can be created is also <B>infinity</B>!! There are millions
of universes, which are classified into 3 major categories. Infinite
number universes and infinite variety of multi-dimensional atoms
collapse down into few <I>primary-dimensional-universe</I>. Very
advanced mathematical equations support this theory.<br/><br/><P>The laws of science and statistics favour the open-source code system
like PostgreSQL and Linux. As the internet speed is increasing everyday,
and internet is becoming more and MORE reliable, the open-source code
system will gain very rapid momentum. And, if rules of statistics and
laws of physics are correct, awareness of science grows and when
<B>IGNORANT</B> people start learning science then the closed
source-code systems will eventually vanish from this planet.&raquo;<p

<a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/09/04/perlfororacle.html">"The Fusion of Perl and SQL: Or how Ayn Rand might have viewed these two strange bedfellows"</a> article doesn't seem quite so contentless and inane.  I guess.  Maybe.

Is <a href="http://www.drbronner.com/story.html" title="drbronner.com">Dr. Bronner</a drbronner.com> writing for Linux.se now? (Okay, it's not quite the same, but there is a certain family resemblance between schizophrenic screeds.)

<p>I have been bothered by Al Dev's LinuxDoc HOWTO's for a long time now.  If I wrote a HOWTO that tried to lay a foundation for belief in <b>Christianity</b> I know I'd get flamed to death.  All we've got is volunteers, but hasn't anyone asked that this stuff be edited out?</p>

I heard that they've stopped distributing this thing; but my houseboy Ignatz was able to find an old backup of it on the Web.
