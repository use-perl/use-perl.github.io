<p>Dear Log,
<blockquote>&laquo;The lower house of the Missouri legislature has approved a law
making it a criminal offence to photograph animals in a barn or any
other place housing them for agricultural, business or research
purposes. The law, aimed at stopping animal rights activists, carries a
one-year jail sentence and a $1,000 fine. AP, Jefferson City &raquo;<p

">"Missouri bans barn photos"</a></blockquote>
You'll get my photo albums of <a href="http://freshair.npr.org/dayFA.cfm?display=day&todayDate=04%2F03%2F2002">livestock mistreatment</a> when you pry them from my cold dead hands!!!  Oh wait, I'm thinking of porn and/or guns.  Nevermind.</p>

<p>All those incriminating photos of Ashcroft giving 'sermons' to the backend of sheep and cows.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I am _SO_ relieved that <a href="http://www.axis-of-aevil.net/archives/000054.html#000054" title="axis-of-aevil.net">this picture</a axis-of-aevil.net> is now illegal!</p>



<h2>In other news...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jweveland/">jweveland</a> on 2002-06-11T13:01:14</h3>
10,000 animal rights activists immediately depart for Missouri from across the globe.  They will now be able to record the abuses and be protrayed as martyrs in the news without incurring additional travel costs, thus helping protect our environment.<br> <br>Looks like a triple-win for the activists to me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>



<h2>Laws don't kill people, people do.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-06-11T18:36:37</h3>
<p>Once again, a perfect example of a case where existing laws are just fine and already solve the problem if enforced.  If that animal rights activist is causing trouble in your barn <b>get him for trespassing</b>, not taking photos.  Trespassing is illegal in Missouri, right?</p>

<p>This is clearly an unconstitutional abridgment of freedom of the press.  I come down firmly on the side of the animal rights activists against this law, though I'm by no means an animal rights activist.  [I like animals, though.  They're quite tasty.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)]</p>



<h2>Pea-brained legislators</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdporter/">jdporter</a> on 2002-06-13T17:21:40</h3>
Here's the exact text of the amendment:
<p><blockquote><div> <i>No person shall&#8230;with the intent to commit a crime, photograph, videotape or otherwise obtain images from within a structure that an animal is housed without the express written consent of the animal facility.</i>
<p>
[caution: this came from <a href="http://www.rtnda.org/news/2002/051702.shtml" title="rtnda.org">the RTNDA</a rtnda.org> web site]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>

Now, it sounds like a pretty silly law... but <b>HOW FUCKING ILLITERATE</b> does one have to be to get elected in Missouri?
</p><p>
"within a structure that an animal is housed"???
</p><p>
Seems to me that a "correct" parse of that paragraph has it talking about animals that are housed without the consent of the animal facility.
