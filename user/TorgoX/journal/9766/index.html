<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;There was a great deal of intense negotiating over which countries actually qualified for the EU, and
eyebrows have been raised at some of the new members, such as Estonia, Lithuania and, most of all,
Narnia. Some objected that Narnia is not technically in Europe, but of course part of it is (well the
wardrobe bit anyway), and so Narnia scraped in. Naturally there have been concerns about its human
rights record, not to mention the rights of fauns and beavers, but Jack Straw rightly pointed out that
the Snow Queen's record on turning her subjects into stone statues has actually improved in recent
years. "The Snow Queen is gradually moving towards a more democratic and less wintry society and it
is important that western leaders are seen to be keeping the wardrobe door open," he said. Further
negotiations could take years, but it will seem like no time at all once the delegation is back home
again.&raquo;<p

<h2>Aw, let Turkey into the EU</h2>

<p>The Ottoman's invaded Europe. Turkey has mixed it up with Greece lots of times. The Anatolian peninsula sure counted as "Europe" when I was took Western Civ. Heck, Turkey has even been persecuting ethnic minorities (the Kurds) just like the greatest of the EU's members. Turkey is as European as any of the other memebers. It's a modern, western-leaning country who's bad treatment at the EU's hands will only lead to heartache in the future. Also, there are a number of excellent Turkish cyclists.
</p><p>Hail, Ataturk!</p>

  They will be in, I'm sure. It just takes time convincing the people that would like Europe to be some sort of christian empire. But they won't hold long.
</p>

<p>
  Interestingly enough, there was a project for some form of EU between the two WW and the definition of the potential membership was "any country at least part on the european continent that is also a member of the SdN [the former UNO]" and people objected in all newspapers of the time that that would leave Turkey out.

  Turkey also has some of the best football players. And excellent food.
