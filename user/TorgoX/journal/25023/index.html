<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;
All right, I told myself, take the practical side of things for a
moment. Let's say that I did write a novel. Your basic, old-fashioned,
here-and-now novel.
[...]

<p>I lugged my computer in there and up onto the workbench. It was an
Osborne 1a. I had bought it in 1983 for all that was left of my bar
mitzvah money plus everything I had managed to save since. It was the
size of a portable sewing machine in its molded plastic case, with two
5-1/4-inch floppy disk drives, no hard drive, and 64KB of memory. At
twenty-five pounds you could shlep it onto an airplane and it would
just barely fit under the seat in front of you. Its screen was glowing
green and slightly smaller than a three-by-five index card. It ran the
CP/M operating system and had come bundled with a fine word-processing
program called WordStar. It never crashed, and it never failed, and I
loved it immoderately.
&raquo;

1a</a>.
And it never crashed.
