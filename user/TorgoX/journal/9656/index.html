<p>Dear Log,
<p>A strange sensation comes over me now and then.  It's a sort of deja-vu, but only sort of.  It is basically the sense that I am in a different city.  It's as basic a feeling as the sense of whether it's day or night outside.  Sometimes it's even accompanied by a sense of being in another time besides another place.  Today, even tho I'm soundly in Albuquerque at the end of 2002, I have the intermittent feeling of being in 1991, in some part of Los Angeles -- say, Sherman Oaks.  I've no idea what's brought this on.

<p>Adding to the oddness, I went to the diner down the block today for breakfast, and two guys sat down at the next booth and were chatting.  I glanced over and was astonished to see that one of them was almost the spitting image of "Bob" from <cite>Twin Peaks</cite>, even down to the wardrobe and hair (altho his hair wasn't as grey as Bob's was).  I was prepared for anything except what actually happened: "Bob" and his friend resumed their conversation, wherein Bob waxed rhapsodic about Rush and Tolkien -- and all this in a weird US accent that I couldn't place -- Coloradan?

<p>I fled.</p>
