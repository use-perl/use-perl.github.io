<p>Dear Log,
<p>
&laquo;
Mr Ashcroft, a devout Christian and a grittily determined singer, went public with one
of his works last month, when he surprised an audience at a North Carolina seminary
with a rendition of Let the Eagle Soar, a tribute to America's virtues, which continues:
<a href="cnn.com/video/us/2002/02/25/ashcroft.sings.wbtv.med.html">"Like she's never soared before, from rocky coast to golden shore, let the mighty eagle
soar,"</a> and so on for four minutes. 
<p>[...]This is not the first time Mr Ashcroft's subordinates have realised that this attorney
general is unlike ordinary politicians. Each time he has been sworn in to political
office, he is anointed with <a href="http://www.pastrywiz.com/archive/infuseo.htm">cooking oil</a> (in the <a href="http://members.aol.com/gunnyding/christ5.htm">manner of King David</a>, as he points out in
his memoirs Lessons from a Father to His Son). 
&raquo;
<p>-- <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,661408,00.html">"Staff cry poetic injustice as singing
Ashcroft introduces patriot games"</a>

<p>Ashcroft creeped my father out when he'd sing before the executions [ daddy had to rig up the radios and whatnot for the prison and the troopers ] in MO praying for the redemption of the man he just condemned to death. He also commented, as I recall, that he sang little hymn-like ditties just about everywhere he went so...this isn't a big surprise to most of the state of Missouri.</p>

<p>You know, there's a reason why Missouri voted for a  dead man instead of him for the Senate in the last election.</p>

For those who don't know the story, the MO voters knew that the deceased's widow would probably take his place should he win, so many of them were really voting for her<nobr> <wbr></nobr>....

It's time to build my bunker. Good thing I'm keen on Spaghettos, which absorb radiation.
