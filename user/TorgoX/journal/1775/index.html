<p>A clever friend of mine with no background in programming is going to move to a job where he's dealing with a lot of programmers.  And I need a bit of advice for him.

<p>Basically: He works in the US Customs Service, and all the Customs Service offices all over the US process import-freight (ceramic frogs, hairpins, "crap" as he calls it) with an ancient and painful legacy computer system, probably written in Ada for all I know.  The <em>big</em> problem arises from the fact that the people who mind the code are a bunch of programmers in Washington DC, who have no direct access to the system's actual users -- until now, as that's my friend's new job; he's been using the system for years, and is moving to DC to advise the programmers on improving it.  (That's not the whole of his job, but a good chunk of it.)

<p>His situation is unusual because he's not actually managing the programmers (and I don't know if anyone is, really, but that's another story), and he's not specifying features to be added to a not-yet-extant program.  Instead he's going to specify new features to be added to this legacy system, sometimes based on users' often-muddleheaded requests for new features.

<p>So I ask all of Perldom:  What books should I have my friend read?  Is there a Clifford The Big Red Dog book on Extreme Programming?

<p>Either post a reply here or email me at sburke&#64;cpan.org
</p>

Well, I'd suggest he just read some general books about programming large things, like The Mythical Man-Month.  It'll help him get an idea for what programmers deal with.  If he were managing I'd recommend Peopleware but that may not be too relevant for his job (I'm not sure).
<br>
<br>Something like Extreme Programming might be good too, just to get some idea of what a programming methodology is, particularly since he'll be filling the user role in this case.
<br>
<br>Or maybe a book that's on overview of various methodologies might be more useful, if the programmers there haven't committed to anything in particular.
