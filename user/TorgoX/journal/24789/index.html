<p>Dear Log,
<p>The recent <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1486432,00.html">performance piece in DC</a> gave me on odd feeling of deja vu that I spent days trying to put my finger on.

<p>Then I remembered -- it was very like the famous <a href="http://juneaualaska.com/history/history_peratrovich.shtml">Elizabeth Peratrovich speech</a> in 1945.  Her speech and the Galloway speech were both unexpectedly and shockingly devastating.

<p>And both speeches had the odd detail that they were both speeches delivered to actually smaller groups of people than one would expect.  That is, Peratovich spoke before the Alaska Senate -- except that it was only really about a dozen people, who met only every other year.  And Galloway spoke before a Congressional committee that had only two of the congressmen in attendance.

<p>Beyond that, there's immense differences, but consideration of those is left to the reader.  Notably, I doubt that Galloway will get a <a href="http://www.sitnews.net/0203news/021403_E_Peratrovich.html">holiday</a> named after him anywhere.</p>
