<p>Dear Log,
<p>
Because we are MOVING BACKWARDS IN TIME:

<blockquote
>&laquo;The basic problems considered here keep recurring. Whatever
progress might be made in computer-related technologies and their applications
has not been reducing the threats, vulnerabilities, and risks related
to the systems upon which we individually and as a civilization depend
most. Overall, this leads me to a sense of frustration that the Risks
Forum has been largely preaching to the choir, and that our message is
not getting through to those who really need it most. All of you
regular RISKS readers are likely to be totally unsurprised by the
items that you read here --- they are just more of the same.
<br>[...]those of us who worry about risks,
hype, propaganda, distortions, and the general demise of scientific
and realistic thinking have been outflanked by well-funded, vested
interests who have everything to gain from maintaining the status quo.

Also in that issue:

<p><blockquote
>&laquo;They used administrator passwords (taped to the backs of the
computers) to override Internet filters and download software such as iChat
that the district policy forbids.&raquo;<blockquote
