<p>Dear Log,
<p>So PricewaterhouseCooper Consulting is changing its name to "Monday".
<p>I couldn't make this up if I tried.<p>On the one hand, the <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/TorgoX/journal/3001">sheer</a> <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/TorgoX/journal/2911">awfulness</a> of the new name is getting them
publicity -- on the other hand, it's all bad publicity.  Yes, there is such a thing as bad press.

<h2>I bet</h2>

that Accenture is thanking their lucky stars that Arthur Anderson required them to change their name back in 1999.<br> <p>To bring readers up to speed who might not be familiar with the story, some years ago, the IT Consulting arm of Arthur Anderson (the Accountancy that's in such hot water these days, ooops... Worldcom, another Anderson customer) was spun off as a totally separate company.  Initially, the name was Anderson Consulting, but Arthur Anderson had something in the original spin-off agreement that they could reclaim the name if they wanted to get back into the IT Consulting biz.  Well, Arthur Anderson exercised their right in 1999 and Anderson Consulting changed their name to Accenture.<br> </p><p>At the time, I thought, "what!?", Accenture is such a artificial sounding name and Anderson Consulting (at that time) had a really good name in the Industry.<br> </p><p>Well, enough time has past now that Accenture people don't have to explain to every customer that they aren't THAT Anderson.  Very very fortunate for them, I think.</p>



<h2>Could have been worse</h2>

When I first saw the story in the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/28/25770.html" title="theregister.co.uk">Register</a theregister.co.uk>, it claimed the new name was Monday: (with a colon stuck on the end).  Makes Yahoo! and Guess? and all those other insane uses of punctuation in names (like use Perl;) look positively conventional.  Fortunately the Register guys seem to have gotten it wrong.<br> <br>Of course, a couple of years ago we were talking about how ridiculous the new name PricewaterhouseCoopers was.
