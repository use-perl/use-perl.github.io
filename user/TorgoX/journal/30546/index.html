<p><p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;"My question is: When do you think the human race conclusively lost
control over its own destiny? I'd like everyone here to answer, if you
don't mind." April produced a handheld notepad. "Please just start
anywhere in the circle-here at my left, will do."

<p>Martha Madronich stood up, reluctantly. "Well, I hate to go first,
but in answer to your question, um, Professor, I figured we lost it
for good sometime during the State of Emergency."  She sat down.

<p>Ed Dunnebecke stood up. "I'd have to say 1968. Maybe 1967. If you
look at the CO&#8322; statistics, they had a good chance to choke it
all back right there, and they knew full well they were screwing the
environment. There was definitely revolutionary potential in the
period, and even some political will, but they squandered the
opportunity in the drugs and the Marxism and the mystical crap, and
they never regained the momentum. Nineteen sixty-eight, definitely--
I've said enough."

<p>Greg Foulks stood up. "I'm with Ed on that one, except there was one
last chance in 1989 too. Maybe even as late as '91, after the First
Gulf War. Well, that one was actually the Second Gulf War, strictly
speaking. But after they blew their big chance at genuine New World
Order in '89 and '91, they were definitely trashed. I've said enough."
He sat down.

<p>Carol Cooper stood up. "Well, you hear this question quite bit, of
course.... Call me romantic, but I always figured 1914. The First
World War. I mean, you look at that long peace in Europe before the
slaughter, and it looks mediation might have had a chance to
stick. And if we hadn't blown most of the twentieth century on fascism
and communism and the rest of the ism bullshit, maybe we could have
built something decent, and besides, no matter what Janey says, Art
Nouveau was the last really truly decent-looking graphic-art
movement. I've said enough."

<p>Sam Moncrieff took his turn. "Late 1980s... there were some
congressional hearings on global warming that everybody
ignored... Also the Montreal Accords on chlorofluorocarbons; they
should have passed those with some serious teeth about CO&#8322; and
methane, and things would be a lot better today. Still heavy weather,
probably, but not insanely heavy. Late eighties. Definitely. I've said
enough."

<p>Rick Sedletter rose. "What Greg said." He sat down.

<p>Peter Vierling stood up. "Maybe it's just me, but I always felt like
if personal computers had come along in the 1950s instead of the
1970s, everybody would have saved a lot of time. Well... never
mind." He sat down.

<p>Buzzard stood up. "I think they blew it with the League of Nations in
the twenties.  That was a pretty good idea, and it was strictly
pig-stupid isolationism on the part of the USA that scragged that
whole thing. Also the early days of aviation should have worked a lot
better. Kind of a real wings-over-the-world opportunity. A big shame
that Charles Lindbergh liked fascists so much. I've said enough."

<p>Joanne stood up. "Nineteen forty-five. United Nations could have
rebuilt everything. They tried too. Some pretty good declarations, but
no good follow-through, though. Too bad. I've said enough."

<p>Joe Brasseur stood. "I'm with Joanne on the 1940s thing. I don't
think humanity ever really recovered from the death camps. And
Hiroshima too. After the camps and the Bomb, any horror was possible,
and nothing was certain anymore.... People never straightened up again
after that, they always walked around bent and shivering and
scared. Sometimes I think I'd rather be scared of the sky than that
scared about other human beings. Maybe it was even worth heavy weather
to miss nuclear Armageddon and genocide... I wouldn't mind discussing
this matter with you later, Professor Logan. But for the meantime,
I've said enough."

<p>Ellen Mae Lankton spoke. "Me? If I gotta blame somebody, I blame
Columbus. Five hundred thirty-nine years of oppression and genocide. I
blame Columbus, and that bastard who designed the repeating
rifle. You'd never find an F-6 on any plain that was still covered
with buffalo.  But I've said this before, and I've said it enough."
She sat down.

<p>Ed Dunnebecke stood up. "Funny thing, but I think the French
Revolution had a very good chance and blew it. Europe wasted the next
two centuries trying to do what the Revolution had right in its grasp
in 1789. But once you stumble into that public-execution
nonsense... Hell, that was when I knew the Regime had lost it during
the State of Emergency, when they started cablecasting their goddamn
executions. Give 'em to Madame Guillotine, and the Revolution will eat
its young, just as sure as hell...  Yeah, put me down for 1789. I've
said enough."

<p>Jeff Lowe rose to his feet. "'I don't know very much about
history. Sorry."

<p>Mickey Kiehl stood up. "I think we lost it when we didn't go for
nuclear power. They coulda designed much better plants than they did,
and a hell of a lot better disposal system, but they didn't because of
that moral taint from the Bomb. People were scared to death of any
kind of 'radiation' even when a few extra curies aren't really
dangerous. I'd say 1950s. When the atomic-energy people hid behind the
military-security bullshit instead of really trying to make fission
work safely for real people in real life. So we got all-natural
CO&#8322; instead. And the CO&#8322; ruined everything. I've said
enough."

<p>Jerry stood up. "I think it's fruitless to look for first causes or to
try to assign blame. The atmosphere is a chaotic system; humanity might
have avoided all those mistakes and still found itself in this
conjunction. That begs the question of when we lost control of our
destiny. We have none now; I doubt we ever had any."

<p>"I'm with Jerry on this one," Jane said cheerfully. "Only more so. I mean,
if you look back at the glacial records for the Eemian Period, the one
before the last set of ice ages, there were no people around to speak
of, and yet the weather was completely crazy. Global temps used to
soar and dip eight, nine, ten degrees within a single century! The
climate was highly unstable, but that was a completely natural
state. And then right after that, most of Europe, Asia, and America were
covered with giant cliffs of ice that smashed and froze everything in
their path. Even worse than agriculture and urbanization! And a lot
worse than heavy weather is now. I'm real sorry that we did this to
ourselves and that we're in the fix we are in now, but so-called
Mother Earth herself has done worse things to the planet. And believe
it or not, the human race has actually had things worse."

<p>"Very good," said April Logan. "Thanks very much for that spectrum of
opinion by people who ought to know. Since I have no intention of
being here when Dr. Mulcahey's forecast is tested, I'll be taking his
advice and leaving Oklahoma immediately. I wish you all the very best
of luck."&raquo;<blockquote
