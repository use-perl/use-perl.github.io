<h1>Working around &quot;Smart&quot; quotes in MSWord</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>Dear Log,
<p>"Smart quotes" is the name of the feature in MSWord (and, equally annoyingly, other word processors) that turns the straight-up-and-down ' and " into little 6 66 and 99 9.  That's fine for normal English prose, but it's often bad and wrong when you're dealing with Perl code, where $x = '123' is NOT $x = `123'.  Here's how to turn that feature off in MSWord 2000:


<p><br><b>To turn off automatic smart quotes altogether:</b>
<p>Uncheck these boxes:
<p>Tools : Autocorrect : Autoformat as you type : Smart quotes...
<br>and
<br>Tools : Autocorrect : Autoformat : Smart quotes...


<p><br><b>To just make there be a way to type ' and " without them getting made into their "smart" versions:</b>
<p>Tools : Macro : Record New Macro
<br>then type "apostrophe" and hit Keyboard,
<br>then type alt-' and hit Assign then Close, and then it'll bring up a macro-recording window.  Just type a ' and press the Stop Recording button on the macro bar (it'll look like a square).

<p>Then do the same for "quote" and shift-alt-'


<p>Then if you go back and edit the macros, they should look like this:

<p><code>Sub quote()
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection.TypeText Text=""""
<br>End Sub</code>
<p><code>Sub apostrophe()
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection.TypeText Text="'"
<br>End Sub</code>

<p>For extra slack, assign &laquo; and &raquo; to alt-&lt; and alt-&gt; !
</p>

When it smartquotes a quote for you that you want to be dumbed back down, hit Ctrl-Z.  It undo's the magic.  (undoes?)<p>

This also works when it turns <tt>configure --prefix</tt> into <tt>configure (onebiglongdash) prefix</tt>.  As soon as it tries to be helpful, Ctrl-Z tells it to back the fuck off.</p><p>

You should tell that to magazine editors... especially <i>PC Professionell</i> (Germany's version of ZD^H^HVNU's <i>PC Magazine</i>) are guilty of this. Both the "smart quote" thing (which is even uglier in German since it implies that C can handle<nobr> <wbr></nobr>,,German`` type quotes where the opening quotes are on the baseline) and the "two hypens make an em dash" thing. Stupid stupid stupid incompetent.

Writing a book in Word?  What's next, writing e-mail in PowerPoint?
<p>
Oh wait.  I've seen that.  There's a reason I'm not in IT anymore.</p>

Some publishers really want things in MSWord.  It "simplifies" things.
<p>I miss the good old days of WordPerfect 5.1-- altho it's i18n capabilities were, shall we say, lacking.</p>

Can you turn off automagic on a 'per style' basis? And if you can't do that out of the box how hard could it be to write a perlscript macro to do it for you?;

It seems possible to turn off all automagic on a per-style basis in WordPerfect; but I can't seem to get the corresponding things to work in MSWord.
I tell ya, if it's not one thing, it's another.

<p>I swear, some days I think that if WordPad did typo-underlining, I'd never use a "real" word processor again.</p>

ORA takes Word, RTF, XML, SGML (a DocBook variant for the last two), Frame Maker, LaTeX, and POD (reluctantly for the last two).<p>

Personally, I fucking <i>hate</i> working with (X|SG)ML--the extra step to make something readable is like a compile step in programming, and slows down my editing.  FrameMaker is too low-level (exposes too many things like kerning that I don't give a rat's arse about).  LaTeX is, well, an abomination masquerading as a monstrosity, and POD has the advantage of being human readable, even if it causes the tools guys who do conversions to make death threats against me.</p><p>

For some books, though, I'd take magic marker on bar napkins so long as I got the text<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>

<h2>Not just Perl</h2>

Smart quotes cause me problems in lots of other ways - for example if you copy text from a Word document into non-MS apps then the spell/syntax checker doesn't recognise the ASCII characters used and flags them as errors. Of course when you look at it on the screen it doesn't look wrong...<br> <br>Yet another example of MS making MS products compatible with MS products only.... or am I being paranoid?
