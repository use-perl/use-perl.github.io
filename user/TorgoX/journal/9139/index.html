<p>Dear Log,
<p>I'm moving to Juneau, Alaska!  Tribal language gig, etc etc.  Also, I have decided that I should stop depriving my Siamese cat of the experience of staring at a glacier.</p>

Actually it's not

Just lots more humidity.
And fog, no sandstorms.

you might want to keep your kitty inside for a while after you get there (don't know if your cat is an "inside" cat or not).  the eagles love cats/small dogs.  really.  it doesn't happen very often but enough so that "everyone" knows someone that's lost a little/young/lost pet at one point or another.<br/><br/>dan

<h2>My wife lived in AK</h2>

She worked in the fish factories in Fairbanks a couple summers and earlier lived in Delta Junction at a miliary base, located smack in the middle of nowhere. It was 60 miles to the nearest McDonalds.
<p>
Oh, and the Toyota Corolla All-Trac (175k) I'm now driving was bought in Alaska by her parents when she was a teenager. Or course it has no AC for obvious reasons...</p>

How can I visit you and discuss Perl over some Frontier rolls?

<p>Just out of curiosity, have you been to Juneau before?  I've been to Anchorage a number of times and while I love the scenery, I was less than enthralled by the city.  I can't imagine that Juneau is going to be that much better.  On the other hand, I love being in a larger city with plenty of nightlife, bookstores, museums, etc., so Alaska doesn't work for me.</p>

<p>If you get to Anchorage, check out the Double Muskie Inn (spelling?).  As I recall, it's a four star restaurant outside of Anchorage.  Strange place for it, but the food is incredible.</p>

that's the right spelling - incredible cajun (and creole) food.  the chef &amp; his wife moved here from louisiana when they came up for a vacation (in fact they didn't even go back).  funny enough i'm headed there tomorrow evening for dinner with friends from outside.  coconut king salmon appetizers followed by some gumbo and a shrimp jambalaya.  even after months (and months) working all 'round the gulf &amp; caribbean the double muskie is still the best cajun/creole food i've ever had.

What kind of tribal language ? Tlingit ?

Every <a href="http://www.geekcruises.com/" title="geekcruises.com">Geek Cruise</a geekcruises.com> that goes north hits Juneau.
<p>
You'll have to come meet us at the dock when we pull in next summer!</p>

In addition to everything else, you'll probably enjoy the oil revenue refund you get.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>Juneau != Anchorage</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jordan/">jordan</a> on 2002-11-29T04:19:45</h3>
I can understand your views on Anchorage.<br> <p>I've never been to Juneau, but I knew someone who had spent quite a bit of time there.  It's really quite a bit different than Anchorage, from what I hear.<br> </p><p>Anchorage is the way it is from numerous boom and bust cycles.  Anchorage is the center for trade for all of Alaska and has lots of shipping and transportation links.  In many ways, Anchorage is what it sounds like, it's a place to anchor, a dirty port town.<br> </p><p>Juneau is much smaller, much more isolated.  The biggest industry in Juneau is Government, followed by Tourism and fishing.<br> </p><p>Now, if you like nightlife, Anchorage is probably far more attractive than Juneau, but if you like scenery and solitude, Juneau wins hands down.<br> </p><p>There's really not much scenery in and around Anchorage that I could see.  You had to drive 40 miles at least to see much.  You can get tours to go see Denali from there, of course.<br> </p><p>The scenery in Juneau is incredible, from what I hear.</p>

juneau is, indeed, a beautiful little town.  most of the towns/villages in southeast alaska are amazing in terms of the views.  sitka and petersburg are even more beautiful, but that's my opinion (mixed with a psychopathic need to flyfish and kayak).  the southeast mountain views &amp; lush forests come at the cost of living in a pretty rainy climate.<br/><br/>even though i live in anchorage i have to say that this town is the "least like alaska" that you'll find here.  in fact the nicest thing about anchorage is that you can drive to alaska from here (local joke).  but this is where most of the money/work is so here i am.  still, in an hour's time i can be fishing and a thousand years from civilization (so to speak).
