<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;In one demonstration, the researchers taped a woman speaking into a camera, and then reprocessed
the footage into a new video that showed her speaking entirely new sentences, and even mouthing
words to a song in Japanese (a language she does not speak) sufficiently well to consistently fool view
ers. Now, while the technique is currently crude and only works on "talking heads" video, the
software, which uses AI to figure out what the person should look like while saying something, is
bound to get better, faster and cheaper.&raquo;<p

...the Ministry of Truth is all around us.  While channel surfing the other day I briedy saw an example where the original tape (okay, I was lead to believe that was the original tape<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) had Hilary Clinton stepped to a podium amidst much booing.  Well, the thing is that apparently a DVD or some more stable recording was made out of that tape-- and in that the boos were changed into cheers.<br>(Note: I couldn't care less whether it was Hilary or someone else, just in case.)<br> <br>
