<p><p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;For the fifty-first time (according to his laptop), Oscar studied the
riot video from Worcester. This eight-minute chunk of jerky footage
was Oscar's current favorite object of professional meditation. It was
a set of grainy photos, taken by a security camera in Massachusetts.

<p>The press called this event "the Worcester riot of May Day '42."
This May Day event did not deserve the term "riot" in Oscar's
professional opinion, because although it was extremely destructive,
there was nothing riotous about it.

<p>The first security shots showed a typical Massachusetts street
crowd, people walking the street. Worcester was traditionally a rather
tough and ugly town, but like many areas in the old industrial
Northeast, Worcester had been rather picking up lately. Nobody in the
crowd showed any signs of aggression or rage. Certainly nothing was
going on that would provoke the attention of the authorities and their
various forms of machine surveillance. Just normal people shopping,
strolling. A line of bank customers doing business with a debit-card
machine. A bus taking on and disgorging its passengers.

<p>Then, bit by bit, the street crowd became denser. There were more
people in motion. And, although it was by no means easy to notice,
more and more of these people were carrying valises, or knapsacks, or
big jumbo-sized purses.

<p>Oscar knew very well that these very normal-looking people were
linked in conspiracy. The thing that truly roused his admiration was
the absolute brilliance of the way they were dressed, the utter
dullness and nonchalance of their comportment. They were definitely
not natives of Worcester, Massachusetts, but each and every one was a
cunning distillation of the public image of Worcester. They were all
deliberate plants and ringers, but they were uncannily brilliant
forgeries, strangers bent on destruction who were almost impossible to
notice.

<p>They didn't fit any known demographic profile of a troublemaker, or
a criminal, or a violent radical. Any security measure that would have
excluded them would have excluded everyone in town.

<p>Oscar assumed that they were all
radical proles. Dissidents, autonomen, gypsies, leisure-union
people. This was a reasonable assumption, since a quarter of the
American population no longer had jobs. More than half of the people
in modern America had given up on formal employment. The modern
economy no longer generated many commercial roles that could occupy
the time of people.

<p>With millions of people structurally uprooted, there wasn't any
lack of recruiting material for cults, prole gangs, and street
mobs. Big mobs were common enough nowadays, but this May Day
organization was not a mob. They weren't a standard street gang or
militia either. Because they weren't saluting one another. There were
no visible orders given or taken, no colors or hand signs, no visible
hierarchy. They showed no signs of mutual recognition at all.

<p>In fact--Oscar had concluded this only after repeated close study
of the tape--they weren't even aware of one another's existence as
members of the same group. He further suspected that many of
them--maybe most of them--didn't know what they were about to do.

<p>Then, they all exploded into action. It was startling, even at the
fifty-first viewing.

<p>Smoke bombs went off, veiling the street in mist. Purses and
valises and backpacks yawned open, and their owners removed and
deployed a previously invisible arsenal of drills, and bolt cutters,
and pneumatic jacks. They marched through the puffing smoke and set to
their work as if they demolished banks every day.

<p>A brown van ambled by, a van that bore no license plates. As it
drove down the street every other vehicle stopped dead. None of those
vehicles would ever move again, because their circuits had just been
stripped by a high-frequency magnetic pulse, which, not
coincidentally, had ruined all the financial hardware within the bank.

<p>The brown van departed, never to return. It was shortly replaced by
a large, official-looking, hook-wielding tow truck. The tow truck
bumped daintily over the pavement, hooked itself to the automatic
teller machine, and yanked the entire armored machine from the wall in
a cascade of broken bricks. Two random passersby deftly lashed the
teller machine down with bungee cords. The tow truck then thoughtfully
picked up a parked limousine belonging to a bank officer, and departed
with that as well.

<p>At this point, the arm of a young man appeared in close-up. A
strong brown hand depressed a button, and a can sprayed the lens of
the security camera with paint. That was the end of the recorded
surveillance footage.

<p>But it hadn't been the end of the attack. The attackers hadn't
simply robbed the bank. They had carried off everything portable,
including the security cameras, the carpets, the chairs, and the light
and plumbing fixtures. The conspirators had deliberately punished the
bank, for reasons best known to themselves, or to their unknown
controllers. They had superglued doors and shattered windows, severed
power and communications cables, poured stinking toxins into the
wallspaces, concreted all the sinks and drains. In eight minutes,
sixty people had ruined the building so thoroughly that it had to be
condemned and later demolished.

<p>The ensuing criminal investigation had not managed to apprehend,
convict, or even identify a single one of the "rioters." Once fuller
attention had been paid to the Worcester bank, a number of grave
financial irregularities had surfaced. The scandal eventually led to
the resignation of three Massachusetts state representatives and the
jailing of four bank executives and the mayor of Worcester. The
Worcester banking scandal had become a major issue in the ensuing
U.S. Senate campaign.

<p>This event was clearly significant. It had required organization,
observation, decision, execution. It was a gesture of brutal authority
from some very novel locus of power. Someone had done all this with
meticulous purpose and intent, but how? How did they compel the
loyalty of those agents? How did they recruit them, train them, dress
them, pay them, transport them? And--most amazing of all--how did they
compel their silence, afterward?

<p>Oscar Valparaiso had once imagined politics as a chess game. His
kind of chess game. Pawns, knights, and queens, powers and strategies,
ranks and files, black squares and white squares. Studying this tape
had cured him of that metaphor. Because this phenomenon on the tape
was not a chess piece. It was there on the public chessboard all
right, but it wasn't a rook or a bishop. It was a wet squid, a swarm
of bees. It was a new entity that pursued its own orthogonal agenda,
and vanished into the silent interstices of a deeply networked and
increasingly nonlinear society.&raquo;<blockquote
