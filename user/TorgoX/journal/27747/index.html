<i>Abstract:</i><br/><br/><blockquote>With the advent of the digital revolution and the
widespread use and acceptance of the personal computer, authors and
poets around the globe have begun to explore the dynamic potential of
new modes of communication, such as hypertext, programming languages,
and multimedia environments. While much has been written about works
that employ hypertext and multimedia, few critics have analyzed poems
authored in programming languages, such as Perl poetry. These computer
language poems, the curious instance in which poem and code are one,
are the most interesting of these new forms of writing since they
provide unique insight into the poetics of digital environments as one
of performance, language games, and word play. Because these digital
forms of writing use new technologies unavailable to previous
generations, there is a strong inclination to characterize them as
radically different and completely unlike traditional print-based
poetries. Yet Perl and other forms of new media poetry represent an
extension, not the dissolution, of concepts already being explored in
avant-garde poetry. Like other forms of avant-garde poetry, Perl
poetry is non-mimetic, non-lyrical, and non-narrative. Instead of
lyricism and plot, Perl poetry foregrounds the material constraints of
the computing environment in connection with a heightened attention to
the visual, aural, and semantic characteristics of both English and
the Perl language. Perl poetry not only signifies an important
addition to the history of contemporary poetry, but also suggests
dramatic implications for the study of poetry. As we enter the digital
age, we must alter our definitions of poetry to include objects
outside our traditional areas of expertise. In so doing, Perl poetry
suggests that in the digital age, poetry is an interdisciplinary
endeavor.</blockquote>

People looking for the book of my columns from Apress can get mildly confused now.



<h2>Theiving bastards</h2>

Frickin' dissertation services. They have a digital copy but they want to charge $33 for it. I wonder if I could get it as a FOIA request since it was submitted to a state university.

FOI request?  I like the way you think.
<p>Those dissertation services are awful and they need to Not Exist.</p>
