<p>Dear Log,
<p>A bit of a 
<a href="http://www.georgetown.edu/irvinemj/technoculture/pomosf.html">William Gibson</a>
moment:
<blockquote>&laquo;
Maybe change isn't really about what is said and done in the centres, it's about the seams, the
 in-between spaces with their hidden strength. In Porto Alegre last week much of the talk was about nearby
 Buenos Aires, where some say a revolt from the seams is already taking place. Street demonstrators aren't
 calling for a changing of the political guard but have instead adopted the sweeping slogan: "Get rid of them all."

Unfortunately, the first time I ever heard of or saw William Gibson was some bizarre documentary while I was at UW Madison.  My impression of him was that he was smug (in a geek sort of way), a liar and an acid freak.  I simply had this incredible urge to knock his teeth out.
<p>
Consequently, I will *never* read a William Gibson novel and most of his quotes are ridiculous nonsense or the same old stuff warmed over.</p>

Some people write well without being telegenic.
Funny, isn't it?
