<p>Dear Log,
<p>Today Randal Schwartz came to town with the photo cruise, just as this year's tourist season went into high gear.  He only had a couple of hours, so I showed him around the old part of Ketchikan ("Creek Street" and the adjacent touristy bits) and up the sikrit trail to all the good photo-ops.
<p>He took some <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/pic/Ketchi/">pictures</a>
with his very fancy camera, and I took 
<a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-06-17_with_photocruise/">a few
pictures</a> with <a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-06-16_morning/,self">my little camera</a> too.
<p>The weather today was good holiday photo weather -- lots of hard sunlight -- but it also got pretty hot, and stayed that way for a good ten hours until sundown.  I know it's prettier when things look like <a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-06-17_with_photocruise/downtown_skyline">this</a>,
but I'm happier when it looks like <a href="http://interglacial.com/d/photos/2004-03-25/antenna_totem_sky">this</a>.
<p>I tried my hand at fixing a weird bug in I18N::LangTags::Detect today.  We'll see what the CPAN-Testers make of it.
<p>Now I attempt sleep.  If my sleep debt gets any larger, I'll have to register Republican.</p>

<p>They say 4 out of 5 of the well padded tourists here this summer are yankees off the cruise ships...apparently 1 every afternoon. I didn't realise it until some giant princess ship docked for the day and I thought downtown was a bit overcrowded for a weekday afternoon...turns out they were all from the tourist boat. I can only imagine what they'd do to Ketchikan. I grew to loathe those ships when I lived in the Caribbean as well. I wish something would kill off the industry.</p>
<p>
And I wouldn't' get too worried over the size and expense of your camera.....

<p>At least they're mostly confined to the, well, touristy part of town, so that we're not tripping over them as we go to the supermarket or anything.

</p><p>Oh, I definitely don't!  I always like cheap technology.</p>

You pointed at the "random unsearchable temporary" point of my website.  That directory is now long gone.  The more permanent link for those pictures (and more) is
