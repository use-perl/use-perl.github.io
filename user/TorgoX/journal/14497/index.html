<h2>Memories</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2003-09-06T06:32:47</h3>
I remember when music was pretty uniformly priced.
<p>
Cassettes were $6.99, Albums were $7.99.  Items from the back catalog that weren't really hot sellers were $5.99 on cassette, and rarely available on vinyl.  Stuff you don't want to admit you own was $2.99 or $3.99 or so.  If you got something on sale, it was never more than $1.00 off, and a discount that deep was rare, generally limited to something the distributor was trying to make platinum.  Double albums were generally $13.99 on cassette, much as you would expect.  (I forget how much double vinyl was, probably $15.99.)
</p><p>
CDs were $14.99 and up.  But it was OK, because they were for yuppies who had money to burn on a CD player that cost a couple of hundred dollars, and a primo stereo system to hook it into.
</p><p>
There was talk back then that the high price was temporary -- it was caused by artist backlash (not wanting to move away from vinyl), low manufacturing capacity, and investments in new anti-theft devices.  Then there were rumors that artists were being offered twice the standard royalty rate to get more titles on CD and create a market.  There was talk that manufacturing capacity would increase RSN.  And distributors came out with "the long box" to foil shoplifters.
</p><p>
The year? 1985.
</p><p>
CD prices have come down a couple of bucks since then, and the value of a dollar has dropped.  But it was easier to buy music when you had $5 and some change in your pocket, or you could break a $10, buy the new Aerosmith and have some money left over.
</p><p>
Funny how the prices never came down.  Funny how music stopped being an impulse buy.  Funny how the distributors are crying "mercy".</p>
