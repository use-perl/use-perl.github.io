<p>Dear Log,

<p>As I poke errantly at my book, I at times sense that I am skirting
around a Big Issue, or at least as big as they get in computing, without
dragging in things like "is there such a thing as free will?". One of
the Big Issues I found myself being drawn toward was the dichotomy of
semantic versus presentational markup -- namely, is it a strictly binary
dichotomy?; is each side just the negation of eachother?; should we
insist that systems be all-and-fully one or another?; and so on.

<p>After having done some amount of reading of philosophers' and
linguists' treatments of Big Issues in their own respective fields, I
have come to think that taking a Big Issue and saying "I will now write
a brilliant analysis of how to solve this problem, consisting of about
700 pages of dense
type" is absolutely the worst thing one could possibly ever do.  If the
problem were tractable to one person sitting down and figuring it all
out, it wouldn't likely be a Big Issue, now would it?  Instead, warm
up to the problem a little at a time, briefly and obliquely, and maybe
what you say about it "can become better
in other people's minds than they were in yours" (to quote Eno).

<p>Below, hopefully illustrating this approach (or at least what I'll in
retrospect rationalize as an attempt at that approach), is a brief
extract from the draft of my book. This bit (and this bit alone) involves a Big Issue, semantic versus presentational markup. It's rather
atypical of the rest of the book, which is very very much about how to
do things, shot thru with codeblocks.

<p><br>[start section]

<p><b>Why Data Extraction is Hard</b>

<p>You may have noticed that some simple-sounding data extraction tasks
sound simple to carry out, but sometimes they turn out to be
surprisingly difficult.  For example, if what you're extracting is "every
image on this page", that does not sound particularly easier or harder
a task than if what you're extracting is "every headline-link on this
page".  But as we saw in the examples above, matching every image
on the page is simple, whereas matching every
headline-link on the page is often quite hard.  This problem is caused
by the fact that HTML provides one good construct for representing images,
the <tt>&lt;img...&gt;</tt> tag, which <em>means</em> an image and <em>looks like</em> an
image.  But HTML provides no construct that means "a bunch of
headline text that's a link to a story", and so if designers want
something that <em>looks like</em> such a piece of text, they're likely
to just use whatever presentational elements (bold, font, etc.)
to get that.  The codes they use will <em>look like</em> a headline, but
they will not <em>mean</em> "this is a headline".  This distinction is
usually referred to as the difference between "presentational" markup,
where you use codes that merely trigger appropriate formatting,
versus "semantic" markup, where you use codes that express that
a block of text is of a class called "headline" (and which incidentally
may have styles of formatting associated with it).  There are
some very big philosophical and practical problems with this
distinction, which basically come from the fact that meaning
(semantics) is always a more complex concept than
appearance (presentation).

<p><p>For example, if web designers pay attention to
the World-Wide Web Consortium's guidelines, they cook up a 
stylesheet (presumably in CSS) that represents all the important
meaningful distinctions that they anticipate using in a prospective
set of documents.  That stylesheet will express that each kind of
distinction should formatted in a particular way -- that a
"headline-link" will have these particular font features,
these particular kinds of spacing, and so on.  Then whenever you
want to write a document with a headline link, you use that
style; and whenever you want to process documents in some way
that means having to distinguish their headline links from other
things, you can refer to these styles.  That makes for markup that's
more semantic than simply using a bunch of presentational tags
like <tt>&lt;b&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;font...&gt;</tt> but it's not the end of the problem.

<p><p>First off, what happens if the stylesheet has to change over time?  If the
designers decide that the original stylesheet fails to distinguish the various
kinds of sub-headlines that need different formatting, they can produce
an amended stylesheet and start using it.  But if your task is to
extract data from a set of documents, some produced with the original
stylesheet, some with the revised stylesheet, you might have to
basically treat these as disparate kinds of documents, each kind
requiring different extraction programming.

<p><p>Second off, the
designers' decisions are basically driven by what kind of distinct
formatting is needed.  While this is a basically sane approach, it has
the disadvantage that semantic distinctions that don't affect
formatting, won't be made.  While everyone in a newsroom
would agree on the semantic difference between a newspaper article
that's simply reporting events ("Five Injured, Lathered in Soap Factory
Accident") and one that's simply opinion ("Andy Rooney: Who Likes Liquid
Soap Anyway?"), there's likely to be no necessary formatting difference
when you're linking to each from the front page of the web site.  So
opinion pieces will get the same headline-link style as event
reporting.  That's a problem if you're trying to write a program
that collects just articles that report on events while ignoring
articles that are opinion columns, editorials, or letters to the
editor.  It's tempting to shrug this off as an "AI problem", but
that's
often just a blanket term for anything we don't know how to do yet.

<p><p>After a long time dealing with data extraction tasks,
I regretfully say that I see no grand universal solution to this
problem; instead, every data extraction task will require a program
unto itself, with little in common with
any other data-extraction program.  The program that pulls headlines
from BBC News's mainpage will likely have nothing to do with a
program that pulls headlines from ABC News's mainpage.  (And
occasionally there may even be surprising differences between
independently written
programs that extract from the <em>same</em> source.)

<p><p>Many kinds of programming are learned first as just a bunch of
particulars, and then over time, the programmer learns to see
over-arching patterns in whatever subfield he's trying to
learn.  This is how the programmer comes to feel that he
understands the problem, and then feels confident in dealing
with particular instances of that problem.  But the task of
pulling data out of HTML doesn't work like that; since every
extraction task is an <i>ad hoc</i> program unto itself, the closest we come
to computational enlightenment is just a familiarity with the
tools (like HTML::TokeParser, or other HTML parsing modules)
and fluency with the process of writing programs that use them.

<p>
  Presentation markup vs semantic markup isn't a real dichotomy imho. That is, if you look at it the right way, as usual, the dichotomy goes away<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
</p>

<p>
  In both cases the documents contain data. In fact, without the markup they might not even be sufficiently organised to qualify as documents, and would thus be raw data (but I'd rather not go too far into that direction).
</p>

<p>
  So what's the diff? Semantic markup is markup that tells the computer (or whatever reads the source) what things are. This is stored between &lt;headline&gt; elements: it's a headline; this is called from an &lt;img<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/&gt; element: it's an image, etc. Presentation markup is markup that is displayed so that the human (or what reads the laid out output). This is big and bold, it must be a headline. This is graphic, it's an image (note that your mention of the &lt;img/&gt; element does not include the possibility for ASCII art, which presentationally is an image<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-).
</p>

<p>
  I guess you see where I'm heading. There's no dichotomy, just metadata. The difference is at whom or what the metadata happens to be aimed. In my opinion, semantic markup works better because it's better to have data extraction jobs done by computers than it is to have them done by humans, and presentation markup can most often be created from semantic markup.
</p>

<p>
  I guess that's why I'm in the bunch of people that think XML is trivially simple and TeX is hell<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
