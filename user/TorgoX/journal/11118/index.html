<p>Dear Log,<p>I have HAD IT with <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/">this stupid brushed aluminum and translucent plastic lozenge look!</a>  It was bad at the beginning and it's not getting any better.  It has all the originality of a Nagel print, but NONE OF THE DURAN DURAN OF A NAGEL PRINT!
<p>Kill it.  I wish it killed.

  Glad to see I'm not the only one it repulses. The translucent stuff is ok, but Brushed Metal Must Die. If I were on the Bush administration I'd produce a complete absence of proof that it is the Iraqi's fault. TorgoX++

Load up the Interface Builder, load up the app's window nib, and turn off the brushed metal look. (Or, rather, the "textured window" flag) Not tough, once you realize it's doable...

That doesn't help when people are so taken with how 'kewl' the look is that they plaster their web sites with elements that look like everyone's favourite candy-coloured GUI.<br> <br>However, if you want to make Mac OS X apps lose the metal look (or, for whatever sick, twisted reason, you want them to gain it), <a href="http://unsanity.com/haxies/metallifizer/" title="unsanity.com">Metallifizer</a unsanity.com> is free and slightly more point and drool than that Developer Tools nonsense.

Hey, the default Aqua look's not that bad. Brushed metal is an ugly abomination (I really want to replace the system bitmap for it with one that's got the text "My developer has no taste!" on it, but that's a separate issue) without a doubt. It's unwise to blame Apple for the fact that so many developers (both computer and website) have absolutely no taste whatsoever--the only real difference recently is that there's a consistency to their bletcherous designs, rather than the cacophany of poor taste that once graced the web....

Although you can mess with Safari's nib, I don't think this will work with iTunes, since the interface isn't based on a nib file; instead, it's internal to the application. (You can tell this is the case because the buttons aren't 'sunk' into the interface in Mac OS X 10.2.3 and later). iTunes has always carried its UI design with it, though (iTunes 1 and 2 are 'metal' in Mac OS 9 as well as Mac OS X).<br> <br>As an aside, the fact that iTunes is Carbon, not Cocoa, doesn't really affect this, as you can have a nib-based Carbon project.
