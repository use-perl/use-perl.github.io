<div class="span8">
<p>Dear Log,

<p>So I've been using XSL for the task of <a
href="http://interglacial.com/user/sburke/stuff/pretty_rss.html">making
RSS pretty</a> by using the browser's XSL engine to turn it into HTML
so it's all pretty and stuff.

<p>But there's a <a
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98168">problem,</a>
or a nasty Gordian knot of misfeatures that collectively de-synergize
to make a problem that no single person bears the blame for.  The
problem is this: there's an option on several "interpolate content
here" operators in XSL, called 
<code>disable-output-escaping="yes"</code>, or DOEY for short.  It's
exactly what I want to use for the situation I'm in, namely:
an RSS feed (=XML) contains escaped HTML, and I want to have the
browser render that HTML.  I want to use DOEY.  But sometimes it doesn't work.

<p>Yes,
<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/08/20/embedded.html">I know.</a>

<p>I know, I know.  I shouldn't be escaping the markup, I should be
using namespaced XHTML.  But, folks, like Larry said, "the Golden Gate
wasn't our fault either, but we still put a bridge across it". (And
that applies even in cases where the Golden Gate might, arguably, be
your fault!)

<p>So, I want to use the DOEY feature, so I can basically say "drop in
some stuff here, but not as literal text, but instead as whatever
you'd get parsing it as markup" -- so that the given input
ten-character string "&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;" doesn't produce the
resulting four-character text string "&lt;br&gt;", but instead
produces a resulting element node with the tagname of "br".

<p>As far as I understand these things, that's just the sort of
problem that DOEY is meant to solve.  But the problem I'm facing is
made of these parts:

<ul><li>Few XSL processors support DOEY -- not even Firefox's
supports it.

<li>And these DOEY-less processors, instead of yowling when they see
DOEY being used (as in:

&lt;xsl:value-of disable-output-escaping="yes"
select="description"/&gt;),
just ignore it -- i.e., disobey it, merrily interpolating the text
just as if you'd said "interpolate the text, but like normal".
(like a plain &lt;xsl:value-of select="description"/&gt;).

<li>And, to add a final spot of glee to the situation, XSL provides
a way to have processors report what features they support.
But apparently, few processors support that way of reporting
whether they support DOEY!  Yay!

</ul>

<p>So, what to do.

<p>I think and I think.

<p>And, eventually, I come upon a brilliant idea:

<p>Once the output text node has been produced (from the input text node that you
wish the XSL processor had applied DOEY to), go use JavaScript
to find that node's content and do <code>node.innerHTML =
node.textContent;</code> on it, forcing the browser to replace the
text node with whatever it gets from parsing that its current content
as HTML source.

<p>It's a brilliant idea
that <a
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98168#c62">someone
else already come up with</a>, as I
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/TorgoX/journal/24177">find
out later</a>.  But, 1) I implement it, and 2) I do it better, because
I also come up with a way to figure out whether that JavaScript needs
to apply at all!  Because some XSL processors <em>do</em> implement
DOEY, and in those cases, you <em>don't</em> want to do the 
<code>node.innerHTML = node.textContent;</code> thing.

<p>What I do is this, very early in the XSL template that
produces the HTML:

<br><br>&lt;html:div id="cometestme" style="display: none;"&gt;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;xsl:text disable-output-escaping="yes" &gt;&amp;amp;amp;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;
<br>&lt;/html:div&gt;


<p>Then I have the JavaScript look at the content of that
(offscreen) text node -- if its text content is a single character,
an ampersand, then we know that the XSL processor actually implemented
the DOEY feature, and so we don't need to do anything to "repair" some
of the text nodes in this document.  If, however, the text content of
our test-node is the five character string "&amp;amp;", then we know
our wicked little XSL processor silently ignores the DOEY attribute,
so we know to go attacking the text nodes in this document 
(doing <code>x.innerHTML = x.textContent</code> for each) that are liable to
contain escaped markup.

<p>And that's just what I do, and it
<a href="http://interglacial.com/rss/explodingdog.rss">works.</a>

<p><a href="http://interglacial.com/rss/smb_rss2html.xsl.txt">Just</a>.
<a href="http://interglacial.com/rss/xsl_mop-up.js">Like</a>.
<a href="http://interglacial.com/rss/smb_xslrss.css">That</a>.
