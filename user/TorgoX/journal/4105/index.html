<p>Dear Log,
<p>I'm fiddling with getting LWP's HTTP::Cookies::Netscape
to read Mozilla cookies files.  I'm writing back and forth
with the Mozilla developers about an apprently inadvertent
change in the file format since NS4.  It think it's a very
good thing for people in different kinds of open source
development to have at least some kind of contact with
eachother, so we know what a great big wide world it is.  (BTW, would anyone find a HTTP::Cookies::MSIE
class useful?)

<p>An idea I had recently:
some of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=author&query=SBURKE">my
Perl stuff</a> <em>is</em> Perl-specific (like Pod::Spell or
strict::ModuleName), but most of it could be easily translated
to other languages.  Something like HTML::TreeBuilder would be a major
undertaking, since it's so massive and messy, but
Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinate would be a snap to translate into
any language; ditto MIDI-Perl, Time::Duration, or Text::Unidecode.

<p>But I've gotten exactly zero mail about such translations, ever.
If you know someone who writes Open Source software in some other language, and is looking for something to do, tell them they can start out by translating some of my stuff into their favorite non-Perl language.</p>

I think the reason there are not enough translations (ports actually) of modules into different languages is that it is really not a sexy job. <br> <br>When an author sets out to write a module the creative part, the design, is really what they look forward to, often more than the final result. Porting a module from another language takes that part out of the process, and with it most of the fun. <br> <br>How many translations of novels were done just for the fun? <br> <br>BTW I once received an email from someone wanting to port XML::Twig to PHP. After I sent him back some elements about the design of the module I never heard from him again<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;--(<br> <br>

<p>True, but I think it'd be really good for someone who's not yet established in the field.  Like maybe a CS student (college, high school, or maybe even earlier) looking for a little project.  Good r&eacute;sum&eacute; fodder.</p>

I've gotten requests to port MP3::Info to other languages.  I politely told them I had a life, and that the code was open source for a very good reason.

I'd just say "I'd rather that someone who want to port it to Snobol (or whatever) be someone who's more fluent at Snobol than I am -- if you find someone, show them my Perl code, and if they have any questions, I can answer them!"
