<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;[...]Realistically, why do most people download music? To hear new music. Not
to avoid paying $5 at the local used CD store, or taping it off the
radio, but to hear music they can't find anywhere else. Face it - most
people can't afford to spend $15.99 to experiment. That's why listening
booths (which labels fought against, too) are such a success.

<p>You can't hear new music on radio these days; I live in Nashville,
"Music City USA", and we have exactly one station willing to play a
non-top-40 format. On a clear day, I can even tune it in. The
situation's not much better in Los Angeles or New York. College stations
are sometimes bolder, but their wattage is so low that most of us can't
get them.[...]&raquo;<p

<h2>Tune into WXYC</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Purdy/">Purdy</a> on 2002-07-09T12:38:44</h3>
The college radio here at UNC (<a href="http://www.wxyc.com/" title="wxyc.com">WXYC</a wxyc.com>) was one of the first to be broadcast on air (if not the first) and it's still going.

The New Mexico "media market" is strange for many reasons, one of which being that the college radio stations aren't like college radio at all -- one (KUNM) is prenty much just straight NPR plus some local call-in/politics shows, and the other is pretty much 24/7 North-Mexican oompah music.<p>The only station like real college radio, is the quite good <a href="http://www.kbac.com/" title="kbac.com">Radio Free Santa Fe.</a kbac.com>  It's still not optimal tho -- you're more likely to turn on and hear a 15-year-old track of Sting singing in Portugese, than to hear something really new and interesting.</p>

Give WXYC a shot - it's real college radio.  Or maybe I haven't heard real college radio, then. &nbsp;;)

<h2>The plus to college radio is also a negative</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Fletch/">Fletch</a> on 2002-07-09T15:46:06</h3>
<p>
I cycle between the local (ATL) alterna-mainstream  station (WNNX, 99.7) and a college station (WRAS, 88.5 Georgia State) (well, and WSB for  talk/news/traffic).  I'll switch from WNNX to WRAS when the former plays something I'm getting tired of hearing for the 9th time that day (<i>*cough*Creed*cough*</i>).</p>
<p>
I'm 99% likely to hear something I've never heard before when I do so.  But the problem is that there's a whelk's chance in a supernova that I'll hear that song again the next time I tune in.

<h2>To hear old music</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-07-10T13:36:06</h3>
<p>I download music to get ahold of old recordings that can't be obtained anymore.  But then, I don't listen to music like most people who are downloading.  I have a few CD's which I listen to over and over (making others around me sick, but I love it), and they mostly consist of classical, new age, and movie soundtracks.</p>
