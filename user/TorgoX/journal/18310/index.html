<p>Dear Log,
<p>My personal impression of Geoffrey Pullum is that he's a yowling doofus,
but I have to applaud him <a href="http://www.wcas.northwestern.edu/linguistics/happening/pullum.html">for
this abstract for a talk he's going to give in Chicago:</a>

<blockquote>&laquo;Try to imagine biological education being in a state where students are
taught that whales are fish because that is judged easier for them to
grasp; where teachers disapprove of tomatoes and teach that they are
poisonous (and evidence about their nutritional value is dismissed as
irrelevant); where educated people accuse biologists of "lowering
standards" if they don't go along with popular beliefs. This is a rough
analog of where English grammar finds itself today.

<p>The state of
relations between the subject as taught by the public and the subject as
understood by specialists is nothing short of disastrous. The fact is
that almost everything most educated Americans believe about English
grammar is wrong. In part this is because of misconceptions concerning
the facts. In part it is because hopeless descriptive classifications
and antiquated theoretical assumptions doom all discussion to failure.
Amazingly, almost nothing has changed in over a hundred years. The 20th
century came and went without affecting the presentation of grammar in
popular books or the teaching (what little there is of it) that goes on
in schools.

<p>Today's grammar books differ in content only trivially from
early 19th-century books. In this lecture I name and shame some of those
on the long dishonor roll of myth-creators and fear-mongers (John
Dryden, Henry Fowler, Ambrose Bierce, William Strunk, E. B. White,
George Orwell, Louis Menand, Stanley Fish), and I sketch a view of what
could and should be taught in a course on the grammar of Standard
English in the 21st century.</blockquote></p>

A humanities professor who likes Unix, how droll.
<p>
His debunking of <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/01-02/04-15/rules.html" title="ucsc.edu">Myths of Grammar</a ucsc.edu> is most interesting, as was the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=+site:www.21stcentury.com.cn+Geoffrey+Pullum+Grammar+21st-Century" title="google.com">21st Century review</a google.com> of his scholarly book.
