<div class="span8">
<p>Sometime this summer while I was poking at perlpodspec, I wrote all the hard parts of a from-scratch Pod parser, to make sure it actually was implementable.  But I tossed out my code out, since I assumed that I wouldn't actually need it -- since once perlpodspec was out, all the Pod::* authors would instantly leap up and make their modules compliant, <em>right?</em>  Ahem.

<br>Well, I probably didn't actually toss out the code, but I failed to name the files anything particularly meaningful or put it anywhere where I'd find it again, so I can't now find it on my vast hard drive.

<p>Anyhow, I rewrote it from scratch, and doing that is never as tedious as I think.  Indeed, as many people will tell you, tossing out your first try at something and rewriting, is usually a pretty good idea.

<p>So now I have the hardest parts done of the new Pod parser module.  It's downhill from here, just a bunch of busywork.  The one remaining notable hurdle that I see, is the processing of L&lt;...&gt; codes.  That's a mess and then some.</p>

<h2>Events, I beg of you</h2>

Sean, please tell me that this parser generates events (in the order they occur).  We talked about this at the last TPC, actually.  I'd kill for a simple event-generating POD parser.  None of this "Hey, we have some text.  Oh, and in that text there was a C section, which was surrounded by an L tag!"  AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  I hate that.
<br>
<br>Anyway, a nice event firing parser (ooh, SAX2!) would be super-sweet.

Yes, very much event-based, and with events getting fired in a sane order.  (Because this is going to be a real parser, not <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/pod-people@perl.org/msg00594.html" title="develooper.com">a tokenizer</a develooper.com>.)
  It'll be either natively SAX, or natively something that's clearly a notational variant of SAX and for which I'd probably provide a simple SAX wrapper.

<p>Incidentally: originally I was going to make this be <em>one</em> black box where you pour Pod in one end and get XML out the other.  (That's as opposed to a model where there's a whole <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Corridor/5788/hamsters/habintro.htm" title="geocities.com">Habitrail set</a geocities.com> of modules, each handling one little aspect of Podliness.)
<br>But I was wisely prevailed upon to make this be mainly a module that fires SAX-like events, and then a little attachment module that turns those events into XML output.</p>
