<p>Dear Log,
<p>Juneau's weather was fine until about four days ago, when a weather system blasted away the whole microclimate, replacing it with blasts of bone-dry freezing wind. When I went outside in the afternoon of the first day to take the trash out and check the mail, I noted that everything looked different in some strange way, especially the ground.  It took me a while to realize that what was odd was that everything was dry; I had never before seen the ground here when it wasn't wet.
<p>A weather phenomenon that's new to me: "freezing spray".
<p>The wind whipping around outside is somehow revealing tiny drafts in even the thick solid walls here -- I think mainly in the vents to the old furnace system (now supplanted by a monitor heater).  It's time to duct-tape them up, altho to do so, I have to go buy some duct tape out, which requires going out, an action that might flash-freeze me.
<p>I want the old weather back!  Altho the sheer shock of seeing the weather outside (watching it overturning small boats, toss around garbage cans like toys, etc) has admittedly provided an excuse not to get any work done.  "How can I write at a time like this -- it's the end of the world outside!"
<p>Meanwhile, a trip to the doctor the other day (in a moment of good weather) got me some Allegra samples to try out.  The first day I got a headache, but not since.  More surprisingly, it stomped down my allergies pretty well -- altho it's about twice as expensive as the Claritin which I haven't yet tried.  On the way to the doctor's, I passed the Mendenhall Glacier at some distance.  It's not the color I expected.  It's screaming dayglo tourquoise.
<p>It has now been a full month that I've spent without Tivo.  THE PAIN!!!</p>
