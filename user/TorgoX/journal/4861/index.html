<p>Dear Log,
<p>In <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/quidity/journal/4828">Quidity's</a>
<a href="http://the.earth.li/user/alex/recruit.html">fine essay</a>, he also said:

<blockquote>[after reading their brochures] I often wondered what many
             companies actually did, other than offering
             "business-critical innovative technical solutions
             from a fast-moving company''.</blockquote>
Reminds me of a story:<p>Once upon a time, I noted that at
<a href="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/">FOLDOC</a>, people were looking for an entry
on "Baan", and not finding it.  So I tried writing one.  I figured out that Baan was a company,
so I ended up at their very expensive web site -- but could find no real information about what they actually did!<p>So I ended up drafting this entry:

<blockquote><b>Baan</b>
<p>&lt;company&gt; From <a href="http://www.baan.com/">Baan's corporate site</a>:
"The Baan Company is a leading provider of enterprise and
inter-enterprise business software <a
href="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=
solution">solutions</a>. The company's family of products is designed to
help corporations maintain a competitive advantage in the management of
critical business processes by having a product architecture that lends
itself to fast implementations and ease of change."
<p>In other words, they make some kind of software that somehow results in
the people who buy the software making money. Exactly how this works is
apparently a closely guarded secret, somehow involving the magic words
"enterprise resource planning" and "manufacturer resource planning".
</blockquote>

Alas, at some point they wised up and added some text to their web site saying
that they actually do -- altho it looks like they've taken it away now!</p>
