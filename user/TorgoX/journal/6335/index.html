<p>Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;The fall of Andersen has a deeper symbolism. The more dishonest US figures are
found to be, the greater the need to consider whether the right things are counted at
all, not just in valuing companies but in nations' true wealth. Gordon Brown has been
given to praising the US for greater "flexibility", "employment" and "productivity"
than Europe. But closer scrutiny may question whether US productivity ever was
quite what it seemed, or was much of that Andersen accounting too?
<p>Andrew Dilnot, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, points out that high productivity of
US workers is mainly because they work fiendishly long hours. Eliminate that and
the shaky science of measuring leaves little significant difference. Another frequent
Brown comparison of US "success" with EU "failure" concerns low US
unemployment. But it takes on another meaning where work is compulsory at a
sub-survivable minimum wage. Work in the US leaves people poorer than
unemployment in the EU. It is like rebadging galley slaves as "employed" and
praising the productivity of shipping. America's real growth counting a notional per
capita wealth signifies almost nothing in a grossly unequal society. Should there not
also be a deficit column in these hard figures that subtracts its poverty, its over-work
or lack of social provision? In which case Europe overtakes it.&raquo;<p
