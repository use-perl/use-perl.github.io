<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;Al-Iraqiya turns the tables, showing alleged rebels unmasked, twitchy
and humiliated as they detail grisly murders and, to widespread
astonishment, tales of drunkeness, gay orgies and pornography.

<p>They took up arms not to fight the occupation, or for Islam, but
because they were common criminals who wanted money. Executing someone
earned $100, says one man. He practised decapitating chickens and sheep
before moving on to policemen and soldiers.

<p>Critics say the programme violates the Geneva convention and question
the veracity of what are clearly intimidated prisoners. Sometimes the
inquisitor confesses on their behalf and they merely nod, eager to
agree.

<p>The interior ministry says the show was an emergency measure and
hints that it will soon be reviewed. Meanwhile, the security forces are
delighted, crediting the change in public mood with a flow of
intelligence tips.

<p>[...]Human rights activists worry that the programme marks a return to Saddam-style public humiliations and coerced confessions, which undermine subsequent trials. Others complain that a complex insurgency which includes Islamic radicals, former regime loyalists and Arab Sunni nationalists is being depicted as nothing more than a coalition of thieving scumbags, a caricature which could deepen religious tensions.&raquo;
