<p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;Arnold Toynbee--one
of the greatest 20th century historians--made a
very astute observation about a common feature of a last stage of
civilization's development.&nbsp; A civilization on the way to a
terminal decline develops escapism that splits into two temporal
directions.&nbsp; Toynbee called them "archaism" and "futurism."&nbsp;
This is evidently present, and growing, in the body of the Western
civilization today.&nbsp; The split also has a geographic
component.&nbsp; Western Europe (and the American ivory tower,
sympathizing with it) pursues a bland, post-national, postindustrial
eurofaggish dream, which is now crashing down on them.&nbsp; And
Middle America steadily marches into the Bible-thumping obscurantism
and ancient stupidities.&nbsp; Increasingly a larger portion of its
populace is unable to accept the most important discoveries of the
19th century (forget the 20th ones)--such as Darwin's theory and
geological history of the Earth--that other peoples have long taken
for granted.&nbsp; And it is only getting worse.

<p>It was not so just ten years ago.&nbsp; America was in the middle of
dazzling, creative renovation, brought by the Internet
revolution.&nbsp; It seemed boundless and endless, brimming with
fantastic possibilities.&nbsp; A lot of wonderful things came to
fruition, but the game was done already by 1996 or 97.&nbsp;
Afterwards innovation was displaced by hype, by the dot-com bubble,
hustle and swindle, which produced some billionaires, much ruination,
and very little in enduring value.&nbsp; It got worse after the bubble
popped.&nbsp; Compared to the five years from 1990-95, the last five
years have seen very little innovation or genuinely interesting
technological development.&raquo;<blockquote
>--<a href=
"http://www.exile.ru/2005-July-15/america_the_irrelevant.html"
>"America the Irrelevant"</a></blockquote></blockquote>

The <a href="http://interglacial.com/user/sburke/pub/Mencken_Quotes.html"
>Mencken in me</a> only adds that escapist (and brutal) delusion is probably common at all points in history, and success of a society is simply those points at which that delusion happens to not be too crippling.
