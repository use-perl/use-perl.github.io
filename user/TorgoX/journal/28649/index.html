<p><p>Dear Log,
<p><blockquote
>&laquo;Tomorrow, Britain's Muslim groups will be joined by
non-Muslims in
Trafalgar Square to show unity against Islamophobia and incitement of
all kinds - without the vile, fanatical and totally un-Islamic chants,
placards and flag-burning we saw in last week's tiny and
unrepresentative march.[...]
<br><br>We will be calling for calm and the resumption of a serious,
frank and constructive dialogue: one based on mutual respect and the
exchange of ideas rather than the trading of insults. That way, Mr
Littlejohn and his friends will realise that we are not fighting a war
- and that we are all winning.&raquo;<blockquote
>--<a href=
 "http://www.guardian.co.uk/cartoonprotests/story/0,,1706813,00.html"
>"This is not a cartoon war:</a>:
Calm dialogue rather than trading insults is the path to a peaceful,
multicultural Britain"</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>Given the European choice between appeasing the Moderate Moslems&trade;
(who are, as always, <a href=
 "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375706488"
 >inadvertently acting</a> as proxies for the Full-On Crazies)
or telling them off, I hereby predict that The Usual EU Officials
will choose the <em>third</em> way that they are expert at: the way
of officiousness and incomprehensibility.

<p>That is, there will be talk of consultations to draft policy papers
which will result in fifteen-hundred page recommendation guidelines,
which will inform community delegates who will invite feedback on
appointing a committee for appointing a committee, whose rotating
chairpersonship will be available for liaising with the European
Journalism Committee about the concerns of the
(meta-)committeemembers' constituencies and competencies.

<p>The Moderate Moslems&trade; won't know what hit them.  Win?  Lose?
Who can tell?

<p>Gone are the days when Europeans said things like "Man will never
be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last
priest." (<a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Diderot">Denis
Diderot</a>)

<p>I wonder what <a href=
"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4260599.stm"
>Salman Rushdie</a> thinks of all this.
