<p>My little pet project mentioned in my first entry is almost complete. It now supports all manner of funky things that no one ever uses (see. protoypes and attributes). Well that's not strictly true, but it's only in the more sophisticated perl projects that one will see the use of attributes (usually doing crazy stuff like encapsulation and pre/post handlers). It even manages to avoid variable name collision by wrapping __ around the sub names (but this is all filtered so unless someone has a sub called <tt>foo</tt> and a var called <tt>$__foo__</tt> all will be well).
<p>
There are however a couple caveats that I hope to overcome before it's possible release. The most grating one has to be not being able to have what looks like a function call in a string as the regex doesn't deal with such trickery yet. And because of the hack to avoid name collision you can't do symbolic dereferencing of the sub (which if you're doing, then probably won't notice in your delirious state of madness ;-)
<p>
See isn't that better? Now you can sleep easily at night/day knowing that this wonderous module is being developed. You can now finally reach that inner calm you've always been searching for. Your whites will be whiter and your brights will be brighter!
