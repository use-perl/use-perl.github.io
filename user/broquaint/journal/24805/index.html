<p>I've just finished up a new <tt>switch</tt> module which should be coming to a CPAN mirror near you soon (and can be found <a href='http://www.broquaint.com/misc/Switch-Perlish-1.0.0.tar.gz'>here</a> presently). It goes by the name of <tt><a href='http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Switch::Perlish'>Switch::Perlish</a></tt> and can be pointed to when foreigners ask where <tt>switch</tt> is in perl. Here's some obligatory example code as taken from the documentation:<br/><br/><pre>
use Switch::Perlish;<br/><br/>my $num = $ARGV[0];<br/><br/>switch $num, sub {
  case undef,
    sub { die "Usage: $0 NUM\n" };
  case [0 .. 10],
    sub { print "Your number was between 0 and 10" };
  case [11 .. 100],
    sub { print "Your number was between 11 and 100" };
  case [101 .. 1000],
    sub { print "Your number was between 101 and 1000" };
  default
    sub { print "Your number was less than 0 or greater than 1000" };
};
</pre><br/><br/><br/>

<p>How does it compare to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/rgarcia/Switch-2.10/Switch.pm" title="cpan.org">Switch</a cpan.org>?</p>

<p>That module seems to do a better Job at simulating the classic switch style but uses a source filter. Your module could probably benefit a lot from the &amp; prototype. Or is there a reason you didnt use prototypes?</p>

Plus Switch is included in my ActiveState build. There is also a cool swith that lets you use switch statements like Perl6.

Good questions!

I'd like to think that in terms of complexity <tt>S::P</tt> is a simpler module because it uses Perl's native syntax. It also has an extensible smart matching system, so it can be used with your own objects. The main intention of the module is in the name - a <i>perlish</i> implementation of <tt>switch</tt>, so it should be subject to all the wonderful features and quirks of perl.

<blockquote> <div> <i>

Indeed, Mr. Conway's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/rgarcia/Switch-2.10/Switch.pm" title="cpan.org">Switch</a cpan.org> provides a much more natural syntax for <tt>switch</tt>, but through the magic for source filters. Unfortunately, this means the actual <tt>switch</tt> code can be rather hairy to debug and means that it goes unused in many production systems.
<p>
As for the use of the <tt>&amp;</tt> prototype, there are a few reasons why I didn't use it. Firstly, it doesn't work how I would like it to - it is desigined to enable one to mimic Perl's builtins, so the block goes <i>first</i>. If there is a way to use the <tt>&amp;</tt> prototype, and utilise its magical bare block functionality in a different position than the first argument, then I don't know about it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Also prototypes cripple the the free-form usage of functions, which isn't very <i>perlish</i> at all,
which strictly goes against the, er, perlishness of this module.

</p> <p>
Perhaps this should all be in the documentation<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p>

<p>I very much like modules which have a section on how they differ from similar preexisting modules. It shows the author didn&#8217;t just mindlessly go to work. Of course, in case of <code>Switch::Perlish</code> I know enough about the competition to know exactly why you did what you did (great job, btw! neat ways to exploit the native syntax), but not everyone might have that benefit.</p>

A very good idea indeed, I'll add that in the next update. Thanks!

With regards to prototypes, I should probably also point out Tom Christansen's <a href="http://library.n0i.net/programming/perl/articles/fm_prototypes/" title="n0i.net">Far More Than Everything You've Ever Wanted to Know about Prototypes in Perl</a n0i.net>, for the folk out there who aren't familiar with the document.
