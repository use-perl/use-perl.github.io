<p>Hi,
<br><br>
The <strong>3rd Belgian Perl Workshop </strong>will take place on <strong>June 26, 2010 </strong>nearby the touristic area of <strong>Brussels</strong>.
<br><br>
The workshop is targeted towards everyone either developing with or interested by Perl.
<br><br>
Obviously, the workshop is only as good as its talks, your talks.
<br><br>
We are interested in all talks about Perl itself or about Perl related topics, and especially talks that would apply to this year's theme. 
<br><br>
The theme for this year's workshop is "The Renaissance of Perl", which we hope will inspire submissions on this and related topics. Also it gives any speaker a very good opportunity to practise a talk for YAPC::EU 2010. ;-)
<br><br>
The submission deadline for your 5, 20 or 40 minute talks is June 01, 2010. 
<br><br>
Lingua Franca for the talks is English (unless you manage to give the presentation in Dutch, French and English in 1 go ;-) ).
<br><br>
Attendees receive a goodies bag, TShirt and a sandwich lunch for only 20 euros.<br>
Speakers with a presentation of minimum 20 minutes are exempt and receive the same package + some belgian chocolates.<br>
In the evening there will also be a social event in a typical belgian pub having the top 100 belgian beers. :-)<br>
<br><br>
Brussels and the BPW 2010 venue is very easy to reach by plane, train (national, Eurostar, Thalys), bus, subway, tram, car, bicycle and on foot. (Snowboards are not yet supported during the summer period but we are working on it. :-) )
<br><br>
More information can be found at <a href="http://www.perlworkshop.be">www.perlworkshop.be</a>
<br><br>
Really hoping to see you there!
<br><br>
Cheers.
<br><br>
Dirk</p>
