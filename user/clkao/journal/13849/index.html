<p><p>looks like i'm <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1437">getting</a> commit access for the <a href="http://svn.elixus.org/member/clkao/svn-perl/">perl bindings</a> of subversion.

<p>the subversion internals are pretty clean, but the api looks even cleaner when using perl:
<blockquote>
<code>
my $ra = SVN::Ra->new($url);<br>
$ra->get_logs (['/'], $fromrev, $torev, $getpath, $strict, \&receiver);
</code>
</blockquote>
<p>
yes I read <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/sky/journal/13809">sky's journal</a>. I had some very evil plan about subversion few months ago, and it seems getting closer with the perl bindings support now. I'll post some design notes later.

<p>
also I don't know if it's just me who noticed that perl folks tend to think subversion people are on various of drug (someone said so on irc), and the subversion people don't really appreicate perl.</p>

<h2>Perl people and svn people</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rafael/">rafael</a> on 2003-08-01T21:10:38</h3>
I'm a perl guy (with hundreds of patches into perl.)
However I did wrote articles for oreillynet about svn -- I contributed patches to svn -- I wrote a perforce-to-svn converter for the perl sources. I think that lots of people in the perl community appreciate svn or consider it with respect. (But, nobody being perfect, Greg Stein is a Python zealot...)

<p>The svn people are very good and very intelligent, but Perl is generally not their tool of choice.  However, I never saw any Perl bigotry from them in the time I read their mailing list.  When a flamewar erupted between Chip Salzenburg and Eric Raymond (I would say entirely at Eric's behest) over Perl they basically asked that it go away.</p>

<p>I think they just consider Perl/subversion integration to be somebody else's itch.</p>

<h2>Is there anything to play with yet?</h2>

<p>This is probably me being dense - but are there some existing bindings available somewhere to play with?

</p><p>At the moment I <code>system</code> out to the command-line routines to get anything done and a nicer way of doing this would be appreciated<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

Found the page I'm replying to via Google with "svn perl bindings", so just for the record, the answer is (by now) "yes, and they're in the src tree - see $SRC/subversion-x-y-z/subvesrion/bindings/swig/INSTALL"<br><br>And at:<br><br><a href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/subversion/bindings/swig/perl/" title="collab.net">http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/subversion/bindings/swig/perl/</a collab.net>
