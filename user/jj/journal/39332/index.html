<p><p>
Following the <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=09/07/17/1910212">perldoc design update</a>, I've now started work on various fixes and optimisations.
</p>
<p>
The first of these is page load time.
</p>
<p>
After profiling in Safari, it became apparent that a large proportion of the load time was due to latency, and that the JavaScript files were blocking the loading of images, delaying the final page render.
</p>
<p>
These issues are now fixed, and the stats for the <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org">perldoc homepage</a> are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Images</b><br>
Reduced from <b>10</b> to <b>3</b>
<li><b>JavaScript files</b><br>
Reduced from <b>4</b> to <b>1</b>
<li><b>HTTP requests</b><br>
Reduced from <b>19</b> to <b>9</b> (3 of which are for Google Analytics)
<li><b>Total download size</b><br>
Reduced from <b>222Kb</b> to <b>165Kb</b>
</ul>
<p>
With a few extra tweaks to the object load order and placement of JavaScript files, the overall page load time should now be significantly reduced.
</p></p>

<p>That sounds like 3 unnecessary requests.</p>

<p>Oh, they're already in my privoxy blockfile, right between fimserve and googleadservices.  I just don't understand why perldoc.perl.org needs to even try.</p>

I don't know, I'm not the one who maintains the site, or even put it together.
<p>
My point was merely that it's silly to say "I can't understand why" if you haven't tried to find out the answer.</p>

<p>Just like it's silly to suggest that I didn't reason about the potential user-tracking needs of an open source project's documentation site.  But anyways...</p>

I'm sure you did consider some ideas about why one might want to use Google Analytics.
<p>
However, there are probably reasons that you didn't consider that Joshua found important.  I suggest that if you want to know what they are, that you ask him.</p>

One reason is for the browser and OS statistics - these tell me what platforms I need to test on.

<h2>Thank you</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2009-07-29T03:41:59</h3>
Thanks for your work on speeding things up.  It sounds like you've made a big change for the better for the users.



<h2>YSlow FF plugin</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/leedo/">leedo</a> on 2009-07-29T04:01:11</h3>
You probably know this, but another traditional approach is to put the JS files at the end of the HTML doc. The YSlow Firebug add-on probably has some other good tips.



<h2>Thank you</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vek/">vek</a> on 2009-07-30T23:06:28</h3>
<p>I just wanted to say thanks for the work you've put into this.  JFDI at its finest.  It's a thankless task and seeing some of the less than helpful replies to some of your perldoc posts here makes me shake my head.  Your work is appreciated mate.</p>
