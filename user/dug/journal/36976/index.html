<p>My entry level construction skills remind me of entry level coding.<br/><br/>I recently had a ductless air conditioning system replaced in my house.  Someone stole the 300 lb compressor from the last unit to get a few bucks at the scrap metal shop, and the unit that they stole has been deprecated for a new version, with more efficient backward incompatible blowers and gas lines.  Many walls were opened up, in a haphazard way.  The company opening the walls and installing the new version doesn't close and patch walls, which is where my story begins.<br/><br/>Instead of reading the documentation on how to patch walls, I thought, "this can't be too hard, I'll just start typing".<br/><br/>The documentation would have told me that if you are patching an irregularly shaped hole, it's worth refactoring that hole into something that will take a piece of sheetrock with straight edges.<br/><br/>Once I figured that out for myself, I though, "Surely enough adhesive sheetrock tape and joint compound will cover my initial mistakes".<br/><br/>Instead of refactoring the base I plowed ahead, adding layers and layers of tape and patch to cover my work.<br/><br/>Lots of sanding and skim coating later, I have new, inefficiently implemented, mediocre, unmaintainably patched walls.<br/><br/>-- Douglas Hunter</p>

<p>When I recently remodelled my kitchen, the biggest problem I had was with drywall (painting, plumbing, tiling, cabinet installation, etc weren't a problem). It just didn't look too hard. I also believed in the power of compound and sanding. Boy do I wish I had gone down to Home Depot and taken the free class they offered on it. It's a lot trickier than it looks.</p>

<p>But I've seen your code, and I trust that you did a better job patching holes in a wall than I did [grin]</p>
