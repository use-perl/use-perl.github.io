<p>I've always had some love for Perl 5's object system.  I appreciate that it doesn't foist an ideology on me, instead providing me tools to build and use an object system that I'm comfortable with.<br/><br/>Typically for me that object system uses blessed hashes, hand-written accessors (with hand-written validation), hand written method parameter validation and explicit manipulation of @ISA.<br/><br/>Why don't I use X for (accessor generation, parameter validation, etc.)?
 
I probably have, and maybe do on a project here or there.  But I've never fallen in love with a combination of OO helpers on the CPAN, and Perl's built in OO mechanisms are usually good enough for me.<br/><br/>A couple of things happened the other day.  I looked at Moose's documentation, and stubbed a couple of classes for a home project.  I was expecting a steeper learning curve than I found, and in a couple of minutes I was working with object system that I liked.<br/><br/>I didn't see anything about method parameter validation in the Moose documentation, so I hopped on irc.perl.org#perl.  People were nice and helpful (thanks autarch, mst and sartak!) and in another minute I had MooseX::Params::Validate plugged in and working away.  I also got some exposure to MooseX::Method::Signatures, Method::Signatures and Devel::Declare.  Insanely cool stuff.<br/><br/>Thank you and congratulations, Moose team!<br/><br/>-- Douglas Hunter</p>

Excellent, I am glad Moose is working for you. Thanks for the nice words too, even though (on some level) I really build modules for myself to my make own life easier, it is always nice to know that others are finding it useful too.

<p>Hi Folks</p><p>Yep, count me in as a supporter, too.</p><p>It's both marvellous and effortless, and even makes me feel good about 'Doing The Right Thing' OO-wise!</p>
