<p><p>My friend <a href="http://allafrica.com/staff/kwindla/">Kwin
Kramer</a> lives in Washington, DC and generously took me out to a
relatively new Belgian restaurant in South East (on 8th street) called
"Belga".  While I could go into a rant about how food on the hill
sucks, instead I'll rave about Belga.</p>

<p>The food  is excellent, the  owner is amiable and  obviously enjoys
running the  restaurant and  the beers are  fabulous.  I'd  drank some
Belgian ales before, but not  triple fermented Belgian ales.  Oh.  My.
Goodness.  The flavor  of the tripels that I've  tried have been full,
spicy  and slightly  nutty.  The  alcohol content  is high,  but they
don't get that  rancid taste of certain barley wines  that I've had in
the US.   I enjoy pouring  them myself, as  I like to stir  up the
precipitated  yeast and  drink them  with the  last half-glass  of the
beer.</p>

<p>I recently discovered that one of my corner delis in Williamsburg
Brooklyn, NY USA sells an "Affligem" Abbey tripel.  I first had this
beer at Belga, and was delighted to know I can find it in my
neighborhood.  </p>

<p>Kwin and I are working on some code that glues together <a
href="http://masonhq.com">Mason</a> and <a
href="http://xml-comma.org/guide-filter.html">Comma</a> (more on that later), which means
periodic trips to Washington for white-board/pair programming
sessions.  This all means Belgian tripels, Flemmish stew and fabulous
mussel pots for me!</p>
