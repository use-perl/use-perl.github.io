<p>I confess that I am, and have long been, a Perl resident alien.  I have used Perl 3, 4 and 5 professionally for over a decade, beginning in tech support in Seattle, ending in application development in DC.  But I have done so without ever becoming a citizen of Perl.  I have never released anything on CPAN or participated in mailing lists and IRC.  I have not written in a use.perl.org journal, and I have not attended a YAPC.  I have just hacked away Perl in solitude, even when part of a development team.<br/><br/>But back in July, that all changed.<br/><br/>"I wonder," I thought, "how the various Perl 6 projects are coming along?"<br/><br/>So I svn'ed myself a copy of parrot and pugs (this was before #perl6 people converted me to SVK), and proceeded to build.<br/><br/>I built parrot first- though I ended up falling back to the tarball, never getting my bleeding edge checkout to compile all the way through.<br/><br/>Then I built Pugs.  Ah, beautiful Pugs.<br/><br/>I think it was about ten seconds later that I was pasting some code from one of the Synopses into Pugs.<br/><br/>Lo and behold!  It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not easily discouraged, I logged on to #perl6, and asked if I was doing something wrong.<br/><br/>Within ten minutes, I had a commit bit.  If you have one, you know how easy this is to get, but if you don't you probably think it's a pretty big honor, like I did at the time.<br/><br/>Within a week, I had written several tests and updated several more test files.<br/><br/>Within a month, I had written my first Perl 6 script (ext/ca_wolfram.pl, if you have a Pugs repository handy).<br/><br/>Within two months, I had made small contributions to Pugs itself (added sprintf("%b",... to Prelude.pm, changed meta to META in Pugs.Prim, etc.).<br/><br/>I even asked a question on perl6-language.<br/><br/>And Larry-Frikkin-Wall-Himself actually responded.  Larry Wall!  To me!<br/><br/>Just this week, I have added Automata::Cellular version 0.1 to the Pugs repository.<br/><br/>And today... today I am writing a use.perl.org journal.<br/><br/>
How did this all happen?  Why the sudden change?<br/><br/>Well, I logged on to #perl6, and asked my question.  In retrospect, it was kind of a dumb question, and I probably didn't ask it as nicely as I might have.  But instead of being met with ridicule, silence, or any other unwelcoming derision, I was summarily informed that I had found an unimplemented feature.<br/><br/>Audrey then asked me for my email address, which I gave her.<br/><br/>She sent me a commit bit, told me to add myself to AUTHORS (what?!), and to then submit a test.<br/><br/>
And now, on this day, I find myself a citizen of Perl.  May there always, and forever be, more than one way to do it.</p>

Wow, you actually made me blush.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
I've been coding Perl since 1994, but didn't participate in any English-speaking communities until 1999, mostly due to the heavy language barrier.
</p><p>
Then I submitted a lightning talk to TPC, talking about an obscure topic (telnet-BBS systems in Taiwan); much to my surprise, MJD accepted it, and I made the trip.
</p><p>
I was extremely socially awkward, but MJD was extremely kind and patient over several encounters; instead of ridiculing my total ignorance on the subject of my quesitons (typeglob references, iirc), he treated them as suggestions to improve Perl5-the-language, and even invited this complete noob to post to p5p! Ever since then I've been trying to follow MJD's example toward new acquaintances.
</p><p>
So, welcome aboard on this new-ship-under-construction!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

So this is what it comes down to?  I take a job cooking and now I communicate with my own flesh and blood via a use.perl journal?<br><br>And, on top of that, I've been asking to see your CA code for CA code (or A::C code, rather) for months, to no avail?<br><br>Not to prod you publicly, but to prod you publicly it would be interesting to see some differences between the p5 prototypes and the p6 code you committed.<br><br>Nice entry, and nice work on pugs and p6.  I have Saturday and Sunday off again this week *shock*, and will buzz you then.<br><br>-- Douglas

One should always be careful what one wishes for.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) But getting Larry to respond...that's something even some pumpkins are rarely deemed worthy of so give yourself a hand.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
