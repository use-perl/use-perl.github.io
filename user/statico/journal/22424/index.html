<p>I usually don't brag, but I being able to sit with a laptop and write while the wind blows a cool 70 degrees Fahrenheit in front of the Carribbean is definitely nice.<br/><br/>I spent the last 1.5 hours working on a proposal for my </code>$writing_project</code>, which I have high hopes for. The project involves a subject which I have become more and more interested in, especially during last semester.<br/><br/>This past semester I toiled through <em>Advanced Writing for the Technical Professions</em>, one of the various huge writing courses that every <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/">Northeastern</a> student has to endure. While the teacher didn't let me do my </code>$writing_project</code>, I did end up composing a solid research paper on test-driven development, one of the emerging <a href="http://extremeprogramming.org/">Extreme Programming</a> practices to improve code quality. I showed off <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Assessing+Test-Driven+Development+at+IBM">a study</a> by the IBM Retail Store Solutions as well as <a href="http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-05222003-225759/unrestricted/Web-CAT.pdf">how Virginia Tech</a> and <a href="http://www.pag.csail.mit.edu/user/mernst/pubs/ct-user-study-issta2004.pdf">MIT's AI lab</a> are successfully using test-driven development in the classroom. I also included and explained a kickass 3D graph which I'm sure helped get me the valuable 48/50 points.<br/><br/>I've begun to rewrite <a href="http://langworth.com/CadubiProject">Cadubi</a> using test-driven development, and it's been going well. I use the functionality I expect in a test and then create the <em>minimal</em> amount of code necessary to make the test pass. Writing the minimal amount of code prevents me from trying to think ahead and write methods that I'll never use --- or worse, methods that I create, don't test, and then attempt to use later on. I'm liking it.<br/><br/>Now, the interesting part: Cadubi is a graphical application for the console... How can I run a test to determine if the marquee tool indeed drew a rectangle in the correct location? How do I test if the help screen correctly draws over the editor? These are things that I don't think I can script easily, let alone write tests for beforehand. Maybe I could <em>simulate</em> a console for Cadubi to write to and test whether the fake console contains certain strings...<br/><br/>PS. Augh! No-see-um bites! Stupid little flies. It's not <em>all</em> paradise -- these things itch like hell!<br/><br/>PPS. It's dark now and I'm being attacked by large moths. There's a hole in my jeans and I fear them flying in and fluttering around. Also, they like root beer.<br/><br/></p>

...only because it's supposed to get down to <b>NINE</b> friggin degrees tonight.<p>
And that ain't Celsius!</p><p>
GO MOTHS GO!!</p>
