<div class="span8">
<p><p>Taking <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge">pudge</a>'s suggestion, I modified my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/statico/14864069/in/set-249424/">use Perl; Journalizer</a> application to use the <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/3294">SOAP API</a> instead of the slightly-buggy <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?WWW%3A%3AUsePerl%3A%3AJournal">WWW::UsePerl::Journal</a>. Now I can write journal entries in spell-checked, minimal-syntax KwikiText <em>and</em> not worry that comments are disabled.</p>

<p>Speaking of tools, have you ever searched for a small utility, only to find in disbelief that no one has already written it, then written it yourself? The most memorable tool in my case is a utility I call "stare."</p>

<p>I'm sure we've needed to watch repeatedly the output of some command. Maybe it was the listing of a directory or some program that reports status information. In those cases, this might come to mind:</p>

<pre>$ while true; do clear; some-command; sleep 1; done</pre>

<p>The problem with the above is that the display flickers. "Okay," you might say, "so why not recreate it with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Curses">Curses</a>?" Well, fair reader, that's exactly what I did almost two-and-a-half years ago. I called it "<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/bass/stare">stare</a>" and used it as an excuse to learn the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Curses">Curses</a> module. I included two useful options: the ability to hide the header line and the number of seconds to refresh. With the exception of resizing the terminal, it mostly works.</p>

<p>I was recently in an environment where installing Perl modules was, at the time, not an option. Remembering that <a href="http://blog.blank-edelman.org/">David</a> uses something called "vis," I searched and found <a href="http://examples.oreilly.com/upt3/split/vis/vis/vis.c">vis.c</a>, an example from <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/upt3/">Unix Power Tools, 3rd ed.</a>. I did have access to gcc so I began to use it, even though it has the terminal-resizing bug and a small hatred for certain argument combinations.</p>

<p>Now here's the kicker: I needed to abstract <code>vis</code> into another utility, which I called <code>watchconf</code>. A few minutes later, when I went to use my shiny new command, tab-completion caused me to blink:</p>

<pre>$ watch
watch      watchconf</pre>

<p>Eh? What is this <code>watch</code> you speak of?</p>

<pre>$ man watch
NAME
     watch - execute a program peri-
     odically,    showing     output
     fullscreen</pre>

<p>No way!</p>

<pre>SYNOPSIS
     watch  [-dhvt]  [-n  <seconds>]
     [--differences[=cumulative]]
     [--help] [--interval=<seconds>]
     [--no-title] [--version]  <com-
     mand></pre>

<p><strong>NO!</strong></p>

<pre>DESCRIPTION
     watch  runs command repeatedly,
     displaying  its   output   (the
     first screenfull).  This allows
     you to watch the program output
     change  over time.</pre>

<p>Yes, folks, this utility comes with the "procps" package, which is installed on Debian Sarge / Ubuntu Hoary by default, AFAIK. Not only has it been there all along, but it includes a "highlight differences" option <em>and</em> it can handle terminal resizing.</p>

<p>I'll sit here patiently and wait for the "told-you-so's."

<p>Heh, yep. As soon as I saw <code>while true ; clear</code> I thought &#8220;doesn&#8217;t he know about <code>watch</code>?&#8221;</p>

<p>Amusing way to stumble over it by yourself, though.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt> </p>



<h2>I'm much too lazy...</h2>

I go through those myself, but I'm too lazy to write the code, so I usually just shelve the thought or work around it.<br><br>My last one is a 'blank' command, which will blank out a file, but leave it there (0 bytes) with the same privs, owners, etc.  But there's prolly a easy workaround, like <tt>"echo '' &gt;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/path/to/file"</tt><br><br>- Jason



<h2>told you so?</h2>

I told you about this back when you wrote stare.
