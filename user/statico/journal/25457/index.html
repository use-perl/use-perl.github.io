<p><p>Being the lazy^Wbusy person that I am, I didn't sit down and write journal entries for the final days of YAPC like I had planned -- I didn't have the time! To back up that excuse, here's an extended explanation.</p>

<p>Also, I have finally posted <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/statico/tags/yapc2005/">pictures</a>. There are a few good ones and the rest are okay.</p>

<p><strong>Day 2</strong></p>

<p>I spent a lot of day 2 at Perl6 talks with a brief stop in Luke Palmer's <a href="http://glop.sf.net">Glop</a> (no files) talk. I learned a bit about both projects (including where to actually /download/ Glop), that Barbie is actually a guy, and why Class::DBI::Relationship isn't good for more than simple relationships (duh). </p>

<p>Mid-day was spent eating <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/statico/tags/roti/">roti</a>, a hot, tasty pocket filled with potatoes and meat/veggies. Imagine Indian food sealed in a big, burrito package. Props to Dan (lamech) for taking us there.</p>

<p>The rest of the night involved the boat cruise around Toronto Harbour and the YAPC annual auction. Beer was drunk, Jerkcity was quoted, and we even got <a href="http://emily.langworth.com">Emily</a> to ask Dan Sugalski when Perl6 was coming out.</p>

<p>chromatic and I signed one of the two-chapter samples of <a href="http://xrl.us/ptdn">PTDN</a>, which sold for $10 at the auction. chromatic inscribed "Please buy the big book" and I wrote "I'm sorry."</p>

<p>I also thanked Larry Wall. Perl is what got me seriously interested in programming, so the least I could do was thank the author.</p>

<p><strong>Day 3</strong></p>

<p>I really wanted to hear about <a href="http://catalyst.perl.org">Catalyst</a> in the "MVC Web Development" talk, but I chose to go see Andy's "Project estimation and tracking that works." As usual, Andy really knew his stuff, and I learned stuff that I wish I had known two years ago when working for <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/groups/systems/">Systems</a>. Andy's slides are available <a href="http://petdance.com/perl/">here</a>, entitled "Preventing Crisis: Project Estimation And Tracking That Works."</p>

<p>After a snack of the stickiest, most unhealthy scones I've ever eaten, I dropped in on Ingy's two talks. Attending an Ingy talk allows one to view deep into the workings of Ingy's brain, </p>

<p>After some awesome (ninjas, juggling, Casey, YAPC::EU) not-so-awesome lightning talks, I took Emily out for pizza before she left to go back to Boston. (Kevin and I left Thursday, which she couldn't get off from work.) I missed the #perl picture, but that's okay. (sniff)</p>

<p>Later that evening I went to a pub and learned more #perl history. Most notable was the whopping $572 CAD for 22 people, and Matt (sungo) doing the counting.</p>

<p>Even later in the evening I went to visit some fine folks over at 89 Chestnut. While there, chromatic and I were interviewed for <a href="http://perlcast.com/">Perlcast</a> about <a href="http://xrl.us/ptdn">PTDN</a>. Stay tuned!</p>

<p><strong>Day <code>$#days+1</code></strong></p>

<p>10 hours of driving. One Corvette with a really ridiculous spoiler, one <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/statico/22738647/">stupid sign</a>, and /lots/ of Northern New York.</p></p>
