<p>I recently received <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=kr4g6a1BGo&isbn=020530902X&itm=1">The Elements of Style</a> as a gift. It's exactly what I've been looking for -- I'd call it, "English: This Missing Manual."<br/><br/>In my "English" courses throughout high school or college, I've only been taught how to be an opinionated expert on reading comprehension. Why don't they use this book?</p>

<h2>One of the best-written books in the English lang</h2>

You're right! It's a classic. You generally don't see it except in journalism and similar writing classes, though.

<p>E. B. White is the same author who did <i>Charlotte the Pig</i> and so much wonderful work for <i>The New Yorker</i> magazine.

</p><p>Isn't that the book that says "Avoid needless words (period)" ?</p>

Yep<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

That's "Charlotte's Web", which along with "Trumpet of the Swan" and "Stuart Little" are children's literature classics.

<h2>Charlotte the Pig?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davebaker/">davebaker</a> on 2005-02-28T17:59:47</h3>
Sheesh. Segfault at my end.

<p>Maybe I was thinking of <i>Freddy the Pig</i> -- the series by Walter Brooks -- I loved those as a kid!</p>

<h2>The anti marketing-speak</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dug/">dug</a> on 2005-02-28T15:51:43</h3>
When I worked for a dot-com I often fantasized about binding several copies [1] together and using the bundle to spank the marketing department.<br> <br>1.  Strunk and White took their own advice when writing "Elements of Style", which left a single copy too thin to use as a paddle.



<h2>The Secret Manual of Editors</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2005-02-28T18:40:04</h3>
<p>If every author I worked with read the book and did what it said, my job would be so much simpler.  Also, if I didn't have to deal with terrible, horrible HTML output from word processors....</p>
