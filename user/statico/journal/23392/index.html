<div class="span8">
<p>I wanted to put Linux on my Powerbook G3 (Pismo/dual firewire). The CD-ROM is long dead, since those CD-ROMs are known defective.<br/><br/>This afternoon I tried, for the life of me, every possibility. I booted the Ubuntu warty CD with another Mac connecting mine with Firewire and "target disk mode." I got a Firewire enclosure and made a Firewire CD-ROM. I tried booting off of a USB CD-ROM. I tried <tt>dd</tt>'ing the ISO to a bus-powered Firewire drive and booting off of that.<br/><br/>The closest I got this way was target disk mode. However, the installation would finish by installing yaboot. Unfortunately, yaboot didn't like the fact that I was trying to install a bootloader over Firewire and was thoroughly convinced that it didn't support Firewire.<br/><br/>I spent another trying to manually hack yaboot and screwed around with Open Firmware. No luck.<br/><br/>So, I've heard of this whole netbooting thing and decided to try it. I found <a href="http://hermes.osuosl.org/mediawiki/index.php/Mac_Netboot">this page</a> which gave me some pointers. I decided to use a spare Mac to host the tftp daemon.  I dropped four files into the tftpd root directory: <ul> <li>vmlinux-2.6 and initrd-2.6.gz (renamed, downloaded from <a href="http://ftp.cs.umn.edu/pub/ubuntu/dists/warty/main/installer-powerpc/current/images/powerpc/netboot/">here</a></li> <li><a href="http://hermes.osuosl.org/user/tmcnulty/macnb/yaboot.conf">yaboot.conf</a></li> <li>yaboot (from the usr/local/lib/yaboot directory of the yaboot-binary package found <a href="http://penguinppc.org/bootloaders/yaboot/">here</a></li> </ul><br/><br/>(Since this spare mac was already running Ubuntu and I had installed the tftpd-hpa package, I dropped all of the files into /var/lib/tftpboot)<br/><br/>I then tested the tftp server with another machine that had a tftp client:<br/><br/><pre>tftp> connect recon.example.com
tftp> get yaboot.conf
Received 344 bytes in 0.0 seconds
tftp> 
</pre><br/><br/>DHCP was already set up on the network, so I ignored that step. Both the tftp-serving machine and my laptop were on the same subnet. <strong>However,</strong> the DHCP server and tftp server were different machines. That requires some extra Open Firmware syntax!<br/><br/>I booted into Open Firmware (Cmd-Option-O-F during startup) and ran the following, given that the machine serving tftp had the IP address 10.0.0.43:<br/><br/><pre>boot enet:10.0.0.43,yaboot</pre><br/><br/>Boom! Ubuntu installer.<br/><br/></p>

I've done netinsts and netbooting on SPARCs. Aren't machines with intelligent bootstrap systems nice?

Ahh, yes, the good 'ol "boot - net install". Neat<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
