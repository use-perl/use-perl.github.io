Very cool idea.  I'm going to keep this handy and give you feedback if I come across something I think should be there.
<p>
How about Test::NoWarnings?  (not that there are any new test functions are are imported, but its still a something that might be of use to someone)<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Cool, I'll add in Test::Warn and Test::NoWarnings. Thanks<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

It looks spiffy.  I think the font is a little big and bulky, or something.  Or, to be less precise but more honest, it doesn't look enough like <a href="http://tnerual.eriogerg.free.fr/vim.html" title="eriogerg.free.fr">The Best Quick Ref Ever</a eriogerg.free.fr>.<br> <br>I'd suggest adding Test::Exception, which is really quite lovely.  (Reminder to self: cpanrate that.)  Oh, and Test::Pod.  If there's still lots of room, Test::Differences, Test::DatabaseRow, Test::LongString.  I'm not sure which of those are really used, these days.  If you go to two pages, you can be pretty liberal in what you include.<br> <br>Doing some more aligning of content might be nice, so the parens opening the param list lined up, then the params lined up as much as possible.  I<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/think/ this would make things clearer.  Give it a try, maybe?<br> <br>Make it clearer, maybe, that eq_foo aren't tests.  I bet there are some other functions in other modules that aren't tests.  A big mistake when I was first testing was to use eq_array as a test.<br> <br>The pixellated camel, though, is totally awesome.

rjbs++<br> <br>I was trying to emulate the standard TeX-based reference cards I've seen in the past, but I was also trying to be a little artsy (with OpenOffice? riiight). However, you plopped the source of a TeX-based quick ref right in my lap.<br> <br>Thanks for the suggesions, I'll get crackin'<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>(Hrm, use TeX, or be artsy..)<br> <br>

<p>Okay, newer version uploaded. Tell me if you like this style more -- tidied code, equal-spaced columns. <a href="http://langworth.com/downloads/perl_test_refcard.pdf" title="langworth.com">Download</a langworth.com> (PDF)</p>

Wow, nice.  I think there's definitely tweaking to do, yet, but now I'm not sure what I'd suggest the tweaking is.  It looks really good!
