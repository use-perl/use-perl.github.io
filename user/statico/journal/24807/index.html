<div class="span8">
<p><p>In using <a href="http://use.perl.org/">use Perl;</a> as a blogging mechanism, I've felt that there are a few features that could improve the posting tool. Namely, there's no spell checking unless I write the content of the entries in some place other than the input field. Second, I hate writing HTML, and I wish there was some other format in which I could write the entries. Today I solved both problems.</p>

<p>I've admired my friend <a href="http://www.vort.org/">Russell</a>'s custom blogging tool, and since seeing it I've always wanted to play around with Glade and GTK+ a little. I <code>apt-get</code>ted the Glade interface designer and Gtk2::GladeXML modules, <a href="http://del.icio.us/statico/gnome+programming">bookmarked</a> a few links, and began to read the examples. I found the Gtk2 module examples and API docs to be the most useful, if not the only, resources while learning.</p>

<p>At first, I thought it'd be easy to create an application with all the simple trimmings: file management, multiple editor windows, copy & paste. After some fooling around and some brief chats on <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/gtk+">#gtk+</a>, I realized that unless I wanted to spend all weekend implementing the frills it'd be easiest to strip out as much unnecessary stuff as possible. Most notably, implementing a polished Edit menu (i.e., greying out items when nothing is selected, determining where the focus is and adding things to the clipboard) is much harder than I originally thought. </p>

<p>Other things, like setting the font of one of the fields, were pleasantly simple:</p>

<pre>$output->modify_font(
   Gtk2::Pango::FontDescription->from_string('Monospace 7') );</pre>

<p>Solving my first problem was equally as simple thanks to the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Gtk2::Spell">Gtk2::Spell module</a>:</p>

<pre>my $input  = $gladexml->get_widget('input');
...
my $spell = Gtk2::Spell->new_attach($input);
$spell->set_language('en');</pre>

<p>Next, I created a spec for a minimal markup language to write the journal entries in:</p>

<pre>This would be a paragraph with _some emphasized_ text
and some *bold* text. Like wiki text, indenting things would
become preformatted blocks, or you could write [code inline].

This would be a new paragraph, and so on...</pre>

<p>I thought it'd be fun to write a cute little grammar with Parse::RecDescent, but this turns out to be an entirely <em>wrong</em> approach. I don't know all that much about parsing, but I'm pretty sure that you can't write a parser for the above with Parse::RecDescent without being completely pedantic and specifying what makes up a word and a paragraph.</p>

<p>I think <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/ingy/">Ingy</a> had it right with the structure of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Kwiki::Formatter">Kwiki::Formatter</a>, which has two interesting properties: First, the formatter is lax -- if they can't parse something, the result is simply unformatted text. The parser never fails. Second, the formatter is defined by specifying <em>what</em> makes up <em>what</em>. My gut is telling me that the Kwiki::Formatter's way and the Parse::RecDescent way are closely related.</p>

<p>(Corrections? Is the answer Parse::RecDescent's lack of backtracking? Hrm.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I ended up using a subclass of Text::KwikiFormatish to format the journal entries, which are then posted to use Perl; using WWW::UsePerl::Journal. My application lets me view the HTML before after it's processed in a separate pane, mostly because I had originally planned to copy the text and paste it into the web form instead of having the application post it for me. No, I'm not sure why.</p></p>
