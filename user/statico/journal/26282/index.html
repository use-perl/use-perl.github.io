<p><p>The OSCON recollection in a kind of meter was humorous, yes, but horribly time-consuming. In summary, OSCON was terrific, I met lots of good people, the four of us could have melded together better in <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/7002">the talk</a>, and I learned about some great projects I'd like to either use or get involved in, or both. Hlaughluagh.</p>

<p>I've set up RT to manage and record tasks and emails regarding my new apartment with Emily. A typical use case is that I'll create a new ticket with my landlord as the requester, who will correspond with me over RT, which will save all of the dialogue as it occurs. Emily and I are both watchers by default, and I can add our parents in as watchers if needed. We can use due dates so that we don't forget about problems, too. Thank you Jesse, the request-tracker Debian package maintainers, and Best Practical!</p>

<p>I've also been pushing to start a <a href="http://crew.ccs.neu.edu/">Crew</a> radio show in hopes to stir up some activity in the group as well as try to improve communication within <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/">the college</a>. I'm planning on including the usual geeky banter mixed with interesting stuff that students, staff or faculty are doing. <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/user/chris/">Chris</a> dubbed it "<a href="http://crew.ccs.neu.edu/wiki/NUrdRadio">NUrdRadio</a>," a potential backronym and tie-in with <a href="http://www.neu.edu/">Northeastern University</a>. Details forthcoming, but for now you can read the <a href="http://crew.ccs.neu.edu/wiki/NUrdRadio">project page</a> as its slowly fleshed out. Make sure to check out the <a href="http://crew.ccs.neu.edu/downloads/audiodiagram.png">sexy graph</a> which shows how everything works together.</p></p>
