<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Color%3A%3AScheme">Color::Scheme</a> has been released to the CPAN. It's a Perl implementation of the blisteringly-useful <a href="http://wellstyled.com/tools/colorscheme2/index-en.html">Color Scheme Generator 2</a>, which generates fantastic sets of color harmony that are usually ready for immediate web use.

Thank you for pointing out the website as well as coding up the equivalent in Perl.

<p>Q. Does it *always* generate color-blind safe combinations? The original website's ability to view with each colorblindness is wonderful.

</p><p>I'm intrigued by the comment that CSG2 and C:S use a non-standard but more accurate HSV model.
Did you see a reference to studies on that? It looks like a *simpler* RGBHSV conversion, but I don't know about "<i> more in accordance with the classical color theory</i>".  Standard color theories are CMYK and RGB and HSV. Using RGB coordinates as if they were RYB seems very cavalier.  An accurate RGB input routine would that converted RGBs without assuming RGB=RYB would probably make it more useful.

</p><p>Typo - <i>This Per; module was created</i>

</p><p> The original JavaScript is licensed CC2 by-nc-sa. Your Copyright says "granted explicitly by the author" -- you got a waiver to recode this under the Perl license?  That's very nice of him, since by-nc-sa is pretty restrictive (not Debian-free).</p>
