<p><pre>Subject: Replacement wrist wrests?

I have a Kinesis Advantage keyboard, but the supplied wrist
wrests have already worn out after a few months of use. I am
not only looking for replacement adhesive wrist pads, but 
I'm curious if I can purchase _thicker_ wrist pads -- I'm
thinking about 1/2-inch thick -- so that my wrists will be
even more correctly aligned. Do you sell such an item or
know where I can obtain them?</pre>

<p>(time passes)</p>

Hi Ian,

The only palm pads we sell for our keyboards are the ones
which came with the original keyboard. If you would like to
purchase additional pairs, please visit our web site at
www.kinesis.com and click on "How to Buy" and follow the
link to our online store. The replacement palm pads sell for
$8 per pair.

Please let me know how I may further assist you.</pre>

<p>In the mean time, maybe I can cut one of those silicon
stress balls in half and stick 'em to the <a href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/contoured_usb.htm">Advantage</a>'s wrist
rests.
</p></p>

Alternatively, you can raise your wrists with your arm muscles.  Rather than wearing out, they are actually strengthened with use.<br><br>I've used kinesis keyboards for years, and have found that it is very important to get the keyboard low enough.  The keyboard is thicker than most, so you have to get the table (or tray) that much lower.
