Emily and I are packed. Tomorrow, movers from TransAmerica will drag our belongings out of the house, and this weekend we'll begin our road trip across the country. It's actually cheaper for us to drive across the country and stay in hotels than for us to ship her car over and buy plane tickets.)</p>

<p>Let's review the plan, courtesy of AAA's TripTik plan:</p>

<ul>
<li>May 21st - Leave Boston, MA, drive down I-90 to Erie, PA. Pass the vineyards, maybe stop in Dunkirk.
</li><li>May 22nd - I-80 then I-90 and then I-89 to Janesville, WI. Apparently Dells, WI has some nifty sandstone. There will be some realization of how much driving remains.
</li><li>May 23rd - I-90 through foresty Minnesota, then more Minnesota, then the rest of Minnesota. Eventually we'll hit Oacoma, SD. 
</li><li>May 24th - Continue on I-90 (surprise) to Rapid City, SD. Check out Mount Rushmore, Crazy Horse, Black Hills, etc. Is it politically correct to ask for a bison burger?
</li><li>May 25th - Follow I-90 north of the Black Hills to Cody, WY, right outside Yellowstone National Park. 
</li><li>May 26th - Check out that famous geyser and the rest of Yellowstone. Carry on to Salt Lake City, UT.
</li><li>May 27th - I-80 to route 95 to the Yosemite Gateway Motel.
</li><li>May 28th - Check out Yosemite if we're not too sick of driving. Proceed to Mountain View, CA. Retrieve keys to new apartment, then make a visit to In-n-Out Burger.
</li></ul>
<p>
I'll try to keep a log here and post some intermediate pictures on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/statico/">my Flickr account</a>. Huzzah!
</p></p>

<h2>Burger options in Mtn View</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dws/">dws</a> on 2006-05-18T05:09:51</h3>
Friends who eat such things claim that Clarke's burgers (on El Camino in Mtn View) are in an entirely different league from In-and-Out. And don't neglect the Burrito options, of which there are several in the excellent category.

Oooh, I'll give it a go. However, Emily's a bit tired of burgers after my incessant hunt for bison burgers on the trip.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>Going through Buffalo</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cbrandtbuffalo/">cbrandtbuffalo</a> on 2006-05-18T16:52:56</h3>
You should be heading right through Buffalo, so make sure you wave as you drive through. What's in Dunkirk that would warrant a stop?
<p><p>
You could stop at <a href="http://www.pizzaplant.com/" title="pizzaplant.com">Pizza Plant</a pizzaplant.com> if it's time to eat. The Main Street location is right off the thruway and they have pretty good food.</p>



<h2>Janesville!</h2>

You'll be just up the road from me!

Let's set something up for the night of the 22nd.
</p><p>
Heck, for that matter, you'll be driving just south of McHenry half an hour.  You could have dinner w/me and Pete Krawczyk and our respective families!

<blockquote> <div><em>Is it politically correct to ask for a bison burger?</em></div> </blockquote>
<p>If it's on the menu, I don't see why not (though it'll probably be listed as "buffalo")? The first place I ever had one was in South Dakota, but it was at my uncle's cattle ranch...he also had a small herd of buffalo (aka "American Bison<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
