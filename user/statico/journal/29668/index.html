Computers typically make use of a "central processing unit," or CPU. After careful self-analysis during today's drive, I've realized that I make use of an "Ian processing unit," or IPU. Much like a CPU, the IPU can perform a lot of work so as long as the activity remains below a maximum threshold level. </p>

<p>Herewith an illustrative example: The IPU might be busy with two tasks. First, the IPU might trying to maintain a comfortable speed of 80 miles-per-hour on Interstate 90 westbound while trying not to get blown off the road due to disturbingly-high winds. Second, the IPU might be listening to the eleventh chapter of <a href="http://librivox.org/dracula-by-bram-stoker/">Bram Stoker's /Dracula/ courtesy of the LibriVox free audio book project</a>. This would leave absolutely no IPU power for such tasks such as, say, noticing when precisely the light on the fuel gauge became lit. </p>

<p>(Emily's Corolla gets 30-35 miles after the fuel gauge lights up, so we were more than fine. Here's where you get to imagine nervous chuckling.)

<h2>I can top that</h2>

The worst part is when you've just told your wife "We're fine. There's at least 10 more miles left in the tank." and then feeling the engine die 5 minutes later. And the previous exit on I-90 in BFE NY is a several miles back. And then, after you've paid $60 out of pocket for the tow truck guy to bring you a can of gas because your AAA membership lapsed but you can't renew over the phone because none of the credit card payments have posted yet, it turns out the next exit is &lt;1 mile down the road.
<p>
How many years do you think my wife will hang that over my head?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

AAA brings cans of gas? Fantastic.
