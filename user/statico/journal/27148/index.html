Subway "T" tokens in Boston cost $1.25. It's still cheaper for me to buy tokens as I go than to buy a commuter pass since I only take the train around 4-6 times a week. Lately I've developed a habit of leaving purchased tokens at home, so when I went to purchase tokens yesterday with a ten-dollar bill, I figured that I'd only need four, not eight. </p>

<p>Here's what happened:</p>

<ol>
<li>I walked up to the booth next to the turnstiles and slipped my $10 bill under the glass. I said, "Four, please," with good articulation and volume to avoid confusion -- a touristy faux pas.
</li><li>The following mix of currency and tokens was pushed back toward me:
<ul>
<li>4 brass T tokens
</li><li>2 Sacagawea golden dollar coins
</li><li>1 Susan B. Anthony dollar coin
</li><li>1 $2-dollar bill
</li><li>1 $1-dollar bill
</li></ul></li>
</ol>
<p>
For those of you not in America, the only part of the above that people typically trade is the $1 bill -- at least, where <em>I</em> live. Golden dollars are unpopular. The $2 bill? Hell, there's even <a href="http://www.snopes.com/business/money/tacobell.asp">urban legend about the service industry thinking that they're fake</a>.</p>

<p>Because I was busy talking to a friend on the ride to school, I didn't fully understand what had happened until I got there. The only logical explanation is that the T attendee recognized my inner nerdiness via scent. He must have decided to test my automata knowledge by presenting a denomination whose correctness can only be calculated in polynomial time.</p>

<p>I figure the extra dollar makes up the the tens of dollars the stupid token machines have eaten over the years, anyway.</p>

I don't know about anywhere else, but in nyc, the dollar coins (sacajewea or Susan B.) are an instant sign to everyone that you've just used a ticket machine at grand central or penn station. I'm wholly unsurprised that you have encountered them in a transit situation.

The MBTA buses and trains used to claim that they wouldn't accept dollar bills. They never enforced this, except for the occasional and rare power-hungry driver/conductor.<br><br>At some point a long time ago I noticed that they added "Golden dollar accepted here" stickers to the coin collecters. I've seen one or two people drop a golden dollar in, but I don't pay that much attention.<br><br>The event described above is the _only_ time I've gotten something other than brass tokens and dollars back a human or machine MBTA token vendor.
