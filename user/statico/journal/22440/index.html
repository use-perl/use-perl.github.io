<p>I love vacation. It's a time when I don't have to worry about a job or classes and I get to work on projects. This vacation, I've got few major projects that I'm pursuing, in alphabetical order:<br/><br/><strong>Cadubi</strong> - My console-based ASCII-art editor. I felt guilty after <a href="http://langworth.com/downloads/talks/cadubi/start.html">denouncing everyone that uses it</a>. So, like a spineless fish, flipped my attitude and vowed to rewrite it and continue supporting it. People claim to use it because of it's ease of use (similar interface to Pico/Nano) and ease of install (it has only one module dependancy and was a single script). The only thing I'd like to change is the single script, though I *could* store all of the modules in the single file...<br/><br/><strong>Dowsing Rod</strong> - <a href="http://www.vodun.org/">Pete</a>'s geographic firewalling project, which I've written most of the backend database and Perl API for. It needs a webapp frontend, SNMP communication with the Cisco access points, and an interface to <code>pf</code>, the firewall. <br/><br/><strong>HostBeast</strong> - The software that manages <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/">The College's</a> database of hosts is going on 12 years old, and it needs a rewrite. I spent a good 9 months or so developing it up until September, when development kind of stalled due to my lack of time. I've got time now, plus clear direction, and it needs to get <em>done</em>.<br/><br/><strong>$writing_project</strong> - I've written about a quarter of my outline and have begun my proposal. Nuf 'ced for now.<br/><br/>In regards to my newfound appreciation for test-driven development, Dowsing Rod and the Cadubi rewrite are both being created by writing tests beforehand. HostBeast has a rather hefty but not-too-up-to-date test suite already, and I plan to create tests first with further development. And the $writing_project -- well, you should be able to guess what that's about.<br/><br/></p>
