<p>As a follow-up to "<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/statico/journal/21389">amputate, dammit</a>," I'd like to thank everyone that replied to me, both off- and on-site. I now have a battery of questions to ask the specialist when I seem him/her. After four weeks of agony I'm finally able to walk without a limp again. Plus, thanks to some amazing work at the physical therapy place, I'm almost good to go.<br/><br/>I've gotten into the RSS game. Because my brain immediately rejects things that approach being trendy I naturally hate the word "blog" and all of its conjugations. I'm a fan of calling this thing a "journal," which seems to ring more with what I write about (Perl escapades, projects, web things, gout). The word "blogging," to me, seems analagous to "blather," "blah," and "mindless brain dribble." Nobody cares about what color socks I'm wearing (white, FYI) and I'm not that thought-provoking, either. My goal is to simply fulfill someone's interest in reading the brainwaves of other Perl hackers and, hopefully, connect with people that would say, "Hey, I've thought about that, too."<br/><br/>I've set up <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> to present me with a pile of comic strips, some tech news (including <a href="http://www.alterslash.org/">AlterSlash</a>), <a href="http://del.icio.us/popular">popular links</a> and journals of friends. I've also set up <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> so I can see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=boston&format=rss_200">pictures people have recently uploaded and tagged for Boston</a>. Plus, I've already been using <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> for a while.<br/><br/>I think I might actually start posting a picture to Flickr daily -- some might call this "photoblogging." I'm not that great of a photographer but I'm sure I can tell when a picture looks like butt. I don't have a high-powered camera, but the PowerShot S230 is fantastically good at taking outside macro shots, which I really like taking. <br/><br/>After reading David Wheeler's articles on Perl.com (<a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/08/27/bricolage.html">1</a>, <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/10/28/bricolage_installation.html">2</a>), I installed <a href="http://bricolage.cc/">Bricolage</a> on one of the servers in my apartment to play around with it. It looks really terriffic but completely overboard for single-person use. However, I still might use it for the experience if there's enough RAM on our <a href="http://crackers.langworth.com/">colo</a> (which I doubt).<br/><br/>I don't do anything really earth-shattering or groundbreaking. I simply want to have all my <a href="http://langworth.com/gallery/">pictures</a>, <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/statico/journal/">journal entries</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/statico">links</a>, <a href="http://langworth.com/downloads/">files</a> and <a href="http://langworth.com">writing snippets</a> in the same place so I can, at the least, entertain people.
