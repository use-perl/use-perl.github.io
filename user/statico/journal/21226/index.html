<p>As a musician, when I hear music I tend to dissect it very carefully. I'm always trying to pick out the individual tracks, samples and patches as well as figure out what they used to create what I'm hearing. Thus, it's pretty hard for me to concentrate when I have music on at all.<br/><br/><a href="http://unferth.net/">John</a> introduced me to trance while I was working for <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/groups/systems/">Systems</a> on my last co-op. Specifically, I became accustomed to the "Goa" or "Psych-Trance" genres, whatever they mean. It seems goa is more "stuttery," rather, there are alot of 32nd or 16th notes constantly chirping away during a steady series of bass kicks. Granted, this isn't the music I normally listen to, but I noticed a strange thing: since the music is typically repetitive, unobtrusive, and (frankly) not all that interesting, I found myself not tuning into it. In fact, I found it to be much like auditory ritalin. For someone that finds it hard to concentrate in general, this stuff is a godsend.<br/><br/>A decent collection of stations is on <a href="http://di.fm/">Digitally Imported</a>, which is also available via iTunes. I specifically zone in while listening to the <a href="http://di.fm/goapsy/">Goa & Psy Trance</a> channel. The quality isn't great (96 kbps), but it's good enough.<br/><br/>Try it for yourself. Thoughts?</p>

<h2>A little like white noise</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/htoug/">htoug</a> on 2004-10-07T08:55:23</h3>
I tried it (on your reccomendation), and find that it helps to prevent me from getting distracted by anything in my surroundings - like the hens cackling in the backyard, the dogs barking at the postman, the trains arriving at the station next door etc.<p>
My feet keep tapping in time to the music, which will either make my legs hurt og give me (bigger) muscles in the shins.</p><p>
I like it!</p>



<h2>Prog is more my thing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/WebDragon/">WebDragon</a> on 2004-10-07T15:08:32</h3>
<p>I tend to listen more to things like Ozric Tentacles and the like, while I code, but then again I generally enjoy far more complex music and found that the more repetetive monotonous stuff eventually got on my nerves enough that I couldn't concentrate.

</p><p>So my favorite stream comes from <a href="http://www.auralmoon.com/" title="auralmoon.com">Aural Moon</a auralmoon.com> at <a href="http://live.str3am.com:2010/" title="str3am.com">their live stream</a str3am.com>

</p><p>I notice that di.fm has a stream they *call* progressive, but which really isn't what I'd consider prog rock. For a better definition of what Progressive *really* is, you should check out the <a href="http://www.gepr.net/" title="gepr.net">GEPR</a gepr.net>, and the rec.music.progressive faq that explains some of the <a href="http://www.kime.org.uk/PK/RMP/faq4.html" title="kime.org.uk">subgenres</a kime.org.uk> of progrock.

</p><p>On the other hand I do occasionally dig the streams from <a href="http://server1.somafm.com:8032/" title="somafm.com">Groove Salad</a somafm.com>, and <a href="http://server2.somafm.com:8000/" title="somafm.com">Secret Agent</a somafm.com>, so go figure<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt></p>

<p>whoops, clicked around a bit more and found the <a href="http://www.gepr.net/genre2.html" title="gepr.net">real subgenre classifications</a gepr.net> elsewhere on the site. my bad.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt></p>

<h2>Plainchant</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dws/">dws</a> on 2004-10-07T21:20:29</h3>
<p>
Plainchant does the trick for me. It's rythmic and smooth. And, as a non-church Latin speaker, I don't get distracted by the words.
</p>
<p>
But, for some reason, debugging requires music with more vigor.
