<p>Perl workshop deux finished tonight. I had about 20 to 25 people show up, down from the first week's 60 or so. I'm not bothered because only THE STRONG HAVE SURVIVED! --- Rather, only the interested. In one and a half hours I covered subroutines, references, the debugger basics, modules, namespaces and Exporter. (<a href="http://langworth.com/downloads/talks/perl-workshop/week-02/">Slides</a> and <a href="http://langworth.com/downloads/talks/perl-workshop/week-02-examples/">examples</a>)<br/><br/><strong>Things I need to improve upon:</strong> Stay on track. However, aside from a humorous rant about how I dislike the Macy's Thanksgiving day parade, most of my digressions were Perl-related. I promised that I'd cover something remotely cool --- I felt it was worth it with my side example in showing how to use LWP::Simple's <code>get()</code> function and then changing the user agent to make sites respond to us that would normally ignore us. They seemed to like that.<br/><br/>Also, at the very least, sync up with the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?perlcheat">Perl cheat sheet</a>. I totally skipped mentioning that the sigil for subroutines is the ampersand, but recovered. <br/><br/>I was also unprepared to fully a question about precedence, but I'll be more prepared for that when I cover "The weird, the Hairy and the Gross: Syntax that bites you."<br/><br/>Additionally, I stumbled a lot. This was mostly due to exhaustion which, let me tell you, is acceptable during this part of the semester.<br/><br/><strong>Things I appeared to be good at:</strong> Keeping them interested. Now that the crowd was smaller and more focused (despite some other class project going on in the lab), I think the students feel more comfortable. Similar to <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/statico/journal/21954">my Cadubi rant</a>, my rant about Macy's was successful. I seem to have this thing for entertaining people while bitching...<br/><br/><strong>Things I wish would happen:</strong> More time. <a href="http://www.jibsheet.com/">Kevin</a> once had a tarball called "wednestay.tar." I need to grab that from him as the workload from these other class projects is <em>nuts</em>.
