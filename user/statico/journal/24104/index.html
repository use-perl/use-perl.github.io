<p>What I'm looking forward to: Friday, when my book on testing will be done and in.<br/><br/>What I'm <em>not</em> looking forward to: Tuesday morning, when I have to explain to my software construction professor why I don't have tests for our network client and server.<br/><br/><tt>&lt;earth&gt; T IAN WHY DIDNT YOU TEST</tt><br/><br/>Let's start with why I didn't test first. Don't get me wrong -- I believe in testing first. It works. The problem was that, at the time, we didn't know what we were testing, or really where we were going. <br/><br/>We had a dead-set homework deadline that we had to meet and, as the business school would tell me, you can't optimize in multiple directions at once. We ended up with a somewhat-working server and a somewhat-working client.<br/><br/>By the time we had figured out good frameworks to use for the client and server, as well as how to do the event-based callbacks and networking/class proxy separation, it was time to finish.<br/><br/><tt>&lt;earth&gt; EXCUSES EXCUSES (YAWN)</tt><br/><br/>So why didn't I test afterwards? I have to blame that one on time as well. Our client and server work enough to do non-automated QA with other groups in the class. We solved each others' bugs by having clients and servers that crashed. Newlines? XML?<br/><br/><tt>&lt;earth&gt; SO MR LANGWORTH WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED</tt><br/><br/>Schedule your life better. Don't have five classes and large projects end in a span of three weeks.</p>
