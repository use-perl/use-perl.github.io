<p><p>A while ago, someone asked the <a href="http://www.jibsheet.com/">then-leader</a> of <a  href="http://crew.ccs.neu.edu/">Crew</a> (my student group) why we weren't doing something cutting-edge with our web site, as cutting-edge is stuff is somewhat of what we're about. So <a href="http://www.jibsheet.com/">Kevin</a> threw on <a href="http://www.axkit.org/">AxKit</a>, which I later learned and wrote tools with for <a href="http://crew.ccs.neu.edu/ctf/">one of our contests.</a></p>

<p>Later on, I discovered wikis. From what I've observed, wikis focus on a band in the spectrum between collaboration and content-management. After playing with XML documents I installed AxKit::XSP::Wiki onto the <a href="http://crew.ccs.neu.edu/">Crew's site</a> so that <em>anyone</em> (from a <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/">college</a> IP) could edit the site. Collaboration, documentation and content appeared at an alarming rate.</p>

<p>AxKit::XSP::Wiki is pretty nice, but Crew found it limited. I decided to create my own. I blathered a bit to <a href="http://www.sergeant.org/">Matt Sergeant</a> and pondered simply extending AxKit::XSP::Wiki. However, I felt that my wiki needed to be a separate project, and created <a href="http://langworth.com/AnotherWiki">AxKit::App::AnotherWiki</a>.</p>

<p>For two weeks around Christmas I was on the island of <a href="http://langworth.com/gallery/eleuthera_bahamas/winter_03/">Eleuthera</a>. I worked on AnotherWiki late at night and added such features using CGI::Wiki as a backend, search, and robust error handling. It looked and worked great. And, like many of my things I expect other people to use, I made it simple to set up.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, on the plane ride back to <a href="http://langworth.com/gallery/boston/">the city</a>, it dawned on me that wiki's aren't appropriate for single users that simply want content management, not collaboration. Already this had been a problem with <a href="http://www.vodun.org/">Pete</a> where people were defacing his cryptography wiki. We wanted easy content creation with a wiki syntax.</p>

<p>Before I even knew what I was doing, I wrote a mod_perl handler that combined File::Cache, the <a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/>Template Toolkit</a> and my Text::KwikiFormatish to create what I now call Apache::TinyCP (Tiny Content Provider). Instructions: 1) Put content into files in a certain directory that would have been wiki pages. 2) There is no step 2.</p>

<p>I've been using this with great success on <a href="http://langworth.com">langworth.com</a>. <a href="http://www.vodun.org/">Pete</a>'s using it as well, and <a href="http://www.nerdcircus.org">Muncus</a> will probably follow if I can convince him.</p> I'm debating uploading it to CPAN, as all the module does is tie together a few things. But then again, it made my life easier, it could make someone elses.</p>

<p>Anyway, to summarize, all of the pages on <a href="http://langworth.com">langworth.com</a> are written in KwikiText. As for AnotherWiki, I announced it to the AxKit mailing list and posted <a href="http://langworth.com/downloads/AxKit-App-AnotherWiki-20FEB2004.tar.gz">a (functional) tarball of where I left off</a>.</p></p>
