Only 200 miles today, but that's because we had a lot to stop, see, and repair.</p>

<p>The Badlands is an impressive place. I can't describe it into words at the moment. Pictures will be up soon.</p>

<p>Coming out of the Badlands the "check engine" light appeared on Emily's Corolla. I checked the levels of all of the non-potable, non-human fluids and consulted the owners manual, which offered such helpful advice like, "When this light appears, bring the vehicle to a licensed Toyota repair location." A bit more reading revealed that it could be one of many things, including a crappy battery. The latter reminded Emily that her mechanic had told her that she needed a new battery. Twenty miles, $90, and a helpful chat with guys at Napa Auto Parts, she had one. Problem solved.</p>

<p>These mid-west highways are littered with billboards. After three-hundred and sixty miles of advertising, we stopped at the famous "Wall Drug" to see what it was all about. Mostly cowboy boots and other garb, unfortunately. </p>

<p>We also checked out some petrified logs and fossils. Again, pictures will be up soon.</p>

<p>Mount Rushmore is impressive. I had never realized that the sculpture is unfinished. A model in one of the buildings shows the original plan which, if completed, would have at least tripled the monument's amazingness.</p>

<p>I've continued to fill my face with bison/buffalo/local meats. Amazingly, the restaurant in Rapid City, SD had Sam Adams. That taste has never been so refreshing, and we're wondering just how far west we'll be able to get it so easily.

<h2>Sam Adams</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2006-05-25T17:07:53</h3>
It's in almost every grocery or liquor store on the west coast. And many restaurants and bars. Whether or not it tastes the same as on the east coast, I couldn't say<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Sam may still be Craft-brewed, but it's long since no longer a micro-brew.<br><br>Of course, Anchor Steam is finally getting legal/official east-coast distribution too.<br><br>Bill
