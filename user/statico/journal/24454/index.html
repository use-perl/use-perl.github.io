<p>I had long forgotten about <a href="http://robowar.sourceforge.net/">RoboWar</a>, a game originally for Mac OS Classic where you programmed robots in a stack-based language that would battle each other in a 300x300-pixel square. I remember spending hours tweaking my robot so that it might stand a chance against such legendary tournament-winning bots such as Arachnoid.<br/><br/>This would be a fantastic project to recreate, as there doesn't seem to be a (released) version available for the non-Mac, non-Windows platforms.<br/><br/>In regards to building a Scheme interpreter to better learn Scheme, I've also come to the realization that I don't know what I'm doing. I <em>have</em> wrapped my head around Parse::RecDescent, which is generally a good thing. I'm working my way through Eli Barzilay's incredibly-well-prepared material for his <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/csu660/overview.html">Programming Languages course</a> to find a solid approach to the whole thing.<br/><br/>Emily has been a bit curious about this whole Scheme thing. It dawned on me that Scheme might be a good resource for her to use to start dabbling with programming -- I asked if she was decent at Excel, to which she replied "yes," and I mentioned that functional programming is much like a spreadsheet with calculations... cells depending on other cells and everything. I installed <a href="http://www.drscheme.org/">DrScheme</a>, pointed her at <a href="http://www.htdp.org/">How to Design Programs</a>, and gave her a few pointers.<br/><br/>My roommate has lovingly loaned me his copy of <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0131429647">Linux Programming by Example</a>. I'm about two-thirds through it and, while not fully memorizing everything, I've learned a boatload. Arnold Robbins really knows his stuff, from C history to differences in implementations. His examples are really clear and useful, and I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who's just finished <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0131103628&TXT=Y&itm=1">K&R</a> and/or wants to start writing practical C on one of the best operating systems on which to develop.<br/><br/>

<h2>Targetting Parrot ?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Bernhard/">Bernhard</a> on 2005-05-01T10:47:52</h3>
In the Parrot SVN there are the beginning of a scheme implementation. It might be a good idea to combine efforts, for targeting scheme on the Parrot virtual machine.
