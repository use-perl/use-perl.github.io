<p>'Twas Monday the First and Ian was headed 
To the Pacific North-West
A Portland event, called OSCON you see 
whose sessions are some of the best<br/><br/>Being Ian's first time to visit said venue
He knew that swell times would ensue
And he jibbered, chortled, spoke and burbled 
And sampled many a microbrew<br/><br/>Tuesday included two tu-torials 
Which piqued Ian's broad interest
Ajax and Mono, things he wanted to learn
And not 'cause of buzzwordiness<br/><br/>Alex Russell, a JavaScript wizard

And he laid low whilst he prepared for

Perl testing, Perl modules, and much more...</p>
