<p>Here's how it started (abridged):<br/><br/><pre>
[14:00] <ua> I'm surprised we haven't heard any Diebold attacks yet.
[14:00] <dha> Or dalek attacks, for that matter.
[14:00] <dha> now that we have new daleks
[14:01] <statico> daleks are the supreme evil beings of the universe -- just don't ask them about stairs
[14:01] <dha> statico - as of their last tv appearance, they can climb stairs
[14:02] <statico> dha: intense!
[14:02] <dha> I'd give you a title, but the last, like, six dalek stories have practically the same title, so I can't remember whihc it is.  It's the McCoy one
</pre><br/><br/>What followed was both the beginning of a meme and the introduction of a standard unit of measurement, the Dalek Meme Run (equivalent to 5 hours).<br/><br/><pre><DrForr> Defeat of the Daleks, Day of of the Daleks, Daleks of the Damned, Those Damn Daleks...</pre><br/><br/>And thus it began. Names have been removed to protect against the infringed.<br/><br/><pre>
