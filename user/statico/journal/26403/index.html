<p><p><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perltestingadn/">Perl Testing: A Developer's Notebook</a> seems to be doing very well! People have posted some nice reviews (<a href="http://www.linux-tutorial.info/modules.php?name=MReviews&op=show&rid=3">here</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596100922/104-3874918-7163948?v=glance">here</a>, along with some personal mails to Chromatic and me), and <a href="http://1.amazonscan.com/scan/details.php?asin=0596100922&days=90">this graph</a> shows that the book is doing well on Amazon.</p>

<p>Our second errata (and first technical errata) was spotted by Arjen Laarhoven who noticed an out-of-scope variable on page 15. It's not extraordinarily awful; I'd expect that readers trying that particular example would identify the problem immediately. Nonetheless, props to Arjen for having a keener eye than myself.</p>

<p>(The first errata, a monstrous tragedy, was omitting <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/dha">David H. Adler</a>'s middle initial from the acknowledgements. I'm sorry, Dave.)</p>

<p>I've been featured on the <a href="http://www.research.neu.edu/">Northeastern University Research site</a>. At first glance I thought the picture was actually of me, and I wondered who had had the guts to take a picture of my screen over my shoulder. Then I tried to remember the last time I wore a tight-collared, white dress shirt.</p>

<p>Emily and I are about to move to Medford, Massachusetts. I found my O'Reilly Media, Inc. contract along with the two-chapter sample from YAPC::NA::2005. I can remember first holding the contract and thinking, "Holy hell, I'm really doing this." It's that same feeling you get on the first day of college, a new job, or football practice -- you've got a general idea of what's about to happen, however, you know that there's a lot more than what you can comprehend immediately.</p>

<p>Also, according to <a href="http://connection.oreilly.com/users/profile.public.php?user_id=2766">chromatic's O'Reilly Connection profile</a>, he's got a last name! At last, we know the truth!</p>

<h2>Do Not!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2005-08-20T22:48:20</h3>
<p>I filed a bug with Connection in that not everyone has a last name.  That should go away soon.</p>



<h2>But is it true?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davebaker/">davebaker</a> on 2005-08-20T23:38:48</h3>
... that chromatic is the son of Cher? They have the same last name<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>spouse's name</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2005-09-19T14:02:16</h3>
Suppose chromatic x marries.  The spouse's name would be chromatic y.

<p>That's just silly.  I bring the Y chromosome to my relationships!</p>
