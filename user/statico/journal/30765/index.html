<p><p>
The problem with ants is that they have poor business-management skills. I'm no contractor, but let me tell you that if I were an ant, I could do things better.</p>

<p>Two months ago I purchased an <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=antworks+ant+farm">AntWorks ant farm</a>, was filled with thirty-odd brown Florida harvester ants. I took some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/statico/tags/antworks">nifty macro photos</a> of it, too. </p>

<p>The directions instruct you to poke four holes in the blue gel, which prompts them into digging. The first mistake was that they picked one of the <u>short</u> holes to begin expanding. It's obvious now that the ants learned lessons from the unions and want to bill more time.</p>

<p>Additionally, the ants are obviously English, not Floridian. They've build multiple roundabouts in their tunnels in areas that <u>obviously</u> support sufficient two-way traffic. Unnecessary!</p>

<p>According on the enclosed publication, the life span of a brown Florida harvester ant is about two-to-three months. Some of the ants have by now perished, and a few bodies were thrown into an isolated pit and sealed off. Dead ant bodies grown fungus, so they're intelligent in that they try not to gag themselves on deadly spores.</p>

<p>Some moron, however, decided to <strong>seal the ant grave prematurely</strong>. Their solution? Dismantle the body of every ant deceased thereafter, and <strong>glue her parts to the wall of the display</strong> like some sicko avant-garde modern art. Maybe it's a cultural thing, but I'd slap the piss out of my kids if they ever cut my dead body up and glued parts of me to a window.

<h2>Beautiful pictures</h2>

<p>Beautiful macro-pictures you got there.</p>

<p>My better half ( &gt; me / 2 ? ) gave me one of those ant farms last year and we pretty much saw the same necrologic behavior (chamber of the dead, then recycling of members of, er, dead members of the colony as makeshift direction sign). </p>

<p>The funny thing is that even though those ants are supposed to live up to two months max, the last two or three survivors of the colony went into a kind of hibernation. Which means that for six months or so, they periodically woke up to their itsy ant version of '28 Days After'... </p>



<h2>Ant burial practices</h2>

I must have been affected by working with archaeologists for the past 2 years, because I found the way you described the ants taking care of their dead extremely fascinating! It made me think about human burials and what behavior of ours would seem extremely bizarre to an outside perspective.<br><br>Also, I agree with Yanick. Nice pics.
