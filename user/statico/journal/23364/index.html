<p>Lately, I've been torn. I <em>love</em> the design of the Mac Mini. I'd kill for one and a nice, clean 19" or 20" Dell UltraSharp display. Small footprint, low-noice and low-dust are things I'm looking for, since I'm getting tired of looking at a CRT at home and my heat sync is beginning to get loud. Plus, it'd deliver the speed of a solid desktop machine so that I could be as productive as possible.<br/><br/>...or would it?<br/><br/>A little background: I have a 500 MHz Mac Powerbook G3 (last model before the Titaniums) as my portable and a custom-built 2 GHz x86 box as my desktop running Debian GNU/Linux. At school I use a mix of Mac OS X, Linux (Gnome) and Solaris (Openbox). <br/><br/>As a workaholic, I'm constantly looking to be more efficient at my tasks. Part of this effort involves searching for the best way to work at a computer. For the longest time I thought the Mac was the way to go, with it's slick drag-n-drop and other GUI features. Lately I've been debating this, and threatening to throw Linux on my poor Apple laptop. However, I wondered if this was due to not having a <em>fast</em> mac.  Today I put that theory to the test.<br/><br/>I hopped on one of the 1.6 GHz G5s in our lab and logged in. I immediately thought of what I worked the best when using Mac OS X on my laptop. I copied my fonts, my X11 settings, installed rxvt. I installed ShapeShifter to use a flatter-looking theme instead of the bubbly Aqua defaults. I installed Desktop Manager to gain some valuable screen space. I installed all of my Firefox extensions and began checking my email with Mail.app.<br/><br/>Wait a second! Terminals? Minimal themes? Workspaces? Sounds awfully like my typical Gnome/Openbox sessions! Other than Mail.app, <a href="http://mike-burns.com">Mike</a> pointed out that I was customizing the Mac to act like a Unix workstation. Hell, other than the sender pictures popping up with Mail Appetizer, I like mutt better anyway.<br/><br/>When I arrived home I did the reverse test: I set up a vnc server on my desktop, connected to it via my laptop with <a href="http://cotvnc.sf.net/">Chicken of the VNC</a> and fullscreened it. Nothing but Openbox, and I'm <strong>loving it.</strong> In fact, I'm typing this entry on it now. All-keyboard is a beautiful thing --- My right wrist is thanking me for not constantly straining to use the trackpad.<br/><br/>There are more factors to this ongoing decision, but I'll save those for later. Right now I'm enjoying the use of a modern X session on an LCD. <br/><br/></p>
