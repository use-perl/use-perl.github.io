<p>My partner and I have moved to using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Class::Declare">Class::Declare</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Class::Declare::Attributes">Class::Declare::Attributes</a> instead of Class::Contract. Why? It provides nice, clean OO-ness with access levels. Also, the built-in cloning is crucial since the interfaces we need to implement are designed for functional programming.<br/><br/>We spent a few hours today finalizing the design for our project and pretty much scrapping the code we turned in last week. Our professor claimed that a major part of this class is learning to doodle. Our doodling today was so damn productive, I almost want to post scans of my notebook.<br/><br/>Our big hitch so far is regarding the type of certain objects. The sample interface we were provided specified a few constants, like NORTH, SOUTH, EAST and WEST. We're wondering whether our directional-related elements should be subclasses of <tt>Thingey</tt>, such as <tt>Thingey::North</tt> and <tt>Thingey::East</tt>, or have properties, such as <tt>$thingey-&gt;type(NORTH)</tt>. The former saves us a line in our test suites per instantiation. Hrm.<br/><br/><tt>$writing_project</tt> is coming along. I'm working on converting my already-written stuff to the new writing style and format. Between tthe <tt>$writing_project</tt>, software development class, keeping tabs on <a href="http://crew.ccs.neu.edu/">the student group</a>, psychobiology and designing language-related experiements for a different psychology class, you could say I've pretty much torn off my nose by leaning too much into the grindstone. I really wish I had this sort of work ethic and drive my freshman year, especially that trimester where I got the those burdensome grades.<br/><br/>Additionally, much respect goes toward Emily for sticking with me even though I stay up all night typing.
