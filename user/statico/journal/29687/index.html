Wisconsin is a nice state. Driving West, a few ancient, sedimentary pillars stand along the highway to remind folks that the whole area was underwater a few millennia ago. We also picked up authentic Wisconsin cheese at an authentic Wisconsin cheese factory located off an authentic Wisconsin highway exit.</p>

<p>Next, a few quick facts about the state of Minnesota:</p>

<ul>
<li>Number of lakes the state claims to contain: 1,000
</li><li>Number of lakes seen along Interstate 90: 2
</li></ul>
<p>
Minnesota was also home to -- yep, you guessed it -- the Spam Museum. Hormel's tradition of high-quality marketing is shown in the form of a giant canned meat emporium. One learns how Spam is made, Spam history -- fricking /everything/. Of course, one can't leave the Spam Museum empty-Spam-handed, so I picked up a small Spam "snack pack" and Emily grabbed a small "Spammy the Pig" plush doll.</p>

<p>Memorandum -- I was quite surprised at the level of quality that the company aims for; I had always thought they simply tossed as much ground-up meat into a can as possible. A can of spam contains only four simple ingredients, despite popular belief: salt, sugar, sodium nitrate (preservative), and choice pork shoulders. </p>

<p>615 miles were driven today. Emily and I are spending the night in Oacoma, South Dakota. I enjoyed my buffalo burger and creamed cucumbers, Emily enjoyed her pork chop. It's nice to eat somewhat-homecooked food grown in the area.

Hopefully not in quantities in that order.

There are some things one's better off not knowing, n'est-ce pas?



<h2>Crappy Food</h2>

Sometimes, you just need the crappy food. Generic mac n cheese... can of spam... can of corned beef...

The Corn Palace in Mitchell is worth a brief stop and a few pictures. It's a true piece of Americana. (Unlike Wall Drug, which is a true piece of Marketing hype.)

Darn. We took a gamble and skipped it thinking it was yet another gimmicky venue. Sounds like we missed out.

You can't see *everything* on one pass and keep any sort of timetable.<br><br>I actually liked Wall Drug when I was 13<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... more years ago that I want to admit<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br><br>

<h2>Cheese!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2006-05-24T15:20:05</h3>
But did you get cheese *curds*?  Were they warm and squeaky?
<p>
BTW, my favorite cheese factory is in a little town called "Rudolph".  Middle of the state.  Don't blink, or you might miss it.</p>

Yep, fresh curds, warm and squeaky. Got to see the process, too.
