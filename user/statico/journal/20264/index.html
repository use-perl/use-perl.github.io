<p>Mad propzors to the <a href="http://www.mbta.com/">MBTA</a>. They allow any mostly-sloshed individual to navigate Boston with the utmost ease as well as provide slow service for said drunken individual to think of things, which I'll now describe in a sea of groggy bloggish blather.<br/><br/>Let's start at the beginning. I had two hashrefs of people contact me and each of which was planning to be in Boston for one night, Thursday -- 53 minutes ago. David escorted me to Davis Square (no pun) where I burbled about a few ideas: A simple blowfish encryption to IO::All, traversing tarballs/tar/gzip archives via IO::All as if they were directories, a drop-in replacement for IO::All locking that used some homegrown solution as opposed to flock/fctrl, and the following example:<br/><br/><pre>io('fileserver.somewhere.com:1234')->{usr}{share}{filez}{leetstuff.txt}</pre><br/><br/>NFS, kinda? How would it work? WebDAV? Samba? Proprietary? IP over gerbil?<br/><br/>I met up with Mark, Nico, Jon, Marc and a freshly-introduced Carla. Memorable quotes, though not verbatim:<br/><br/>Me, to Mark: "How's the ol' search engine going? Still finding things?"
(Mark works at the Google.)<br/><br/>Nico: "Yeah, the Vim mug really helped me out. I learned a few things."
Me: "Sadly enough, our Vim mouse pad is pretty much deteriorated."
Mark: "I actually have Vim bed sheets. Y'know, learning through osmosis."<br/><br/>Guess you had to be there.<br/><br/>Anyway, so far, so sober. After some ice cream, I met up with @{$friendstack[1]} near the Broadway T stop. Steve, some of Steve's brothers and friends, and Postie Pete -- all folks I've known via high school. I don't get to talk to Steve much as he's a hard-working, smart individual that goes to the University of San Francisco. Anyway, some uncountable amount of hot dogs and burgers and beers later, plus a visit to the local bar, I'm rolling around on the T and catching the last train to Symphony.<br/><br/>Back to the Perl stuff. In my inebriated ride from Andrews to Park Street to Symphony, I thought more about the topic for my middle year paper. (All <a href="http://www.neu.edu/">Northeastern University</a> students are required to take a writing course about midway through their college career where they spend a whole semester writing a single paper.) My paper topic is this: a language-independant shared code repository. I also want to solve the problem of "Module not found in @INC" by being able to "use lib 'http://....'". I also want to make Don't get me wrong -- the current systems in place (CPAN, searhc.cpan.org, CPAN ratings, RT, CPAN testers, etc.) work fantastically. I simply want to analyze what there is, what other languages are doing, and present a thought-provoking uber-repository for the Perl community. Writing about it and raising my shitty-ass G.P.A. would help, too.<br/><br/>Apparently Brian and Autrijus have already done work in this area with <a href="http://freepan.org">freepand.org</a> and PAR, respectively. I'll be bugging them soon enough.<br/><br/>I'm tired and hosed. If there are spelling, grammar or hyperlink errors, send them to devnull@langworth.com. </p>
