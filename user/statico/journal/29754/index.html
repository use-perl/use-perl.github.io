First, the biggest news first: I'm now engaged to Emily, my girlfriend of 3.5 years. Details forthcoming.</p>

<p>Next, if you ever find yourself East of Yosemite in a little town called Lee Vining on the edge of Lake Mono, make sure that you eat at Nicely's Restaurant. It's a damn good diner, and it's the first place I've seen to offer a French dip with pastrami.</p>

<p>Emily and I arrived in Mountain View yesterday and signed the lease for the new apartment. It's a really nice neighborhood, it has nice facilities, and even the landlord lives on the premiss with her kids. Too bad our belongings don't arrive until probably Tuesday -- the day after Emily and I begin work at our new jobs.</p>

<h2>Congrats!</h2>

Much congratulations! Yes, we demand to know the story in all its mushy details.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Tell me you proposed at Yellowstone next to one of those sulfer farting lakes of mud.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br/><br/>Are the residents of Lake Mono still completely batshit crazy? When I was there, you couldn't order a sammich without getting the 2 hour lecture about the evils of L.A. and their water pipeline. (Granted, L.A. has violated those people pretty hard but still. GIMME MY DAMN SAMMICH! *ahem*)
