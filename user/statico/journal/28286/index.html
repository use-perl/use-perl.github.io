<div class="span8">
<p><p>The first sentence of any piece of writing is important, and last night I read one of the best openings ever written. It sits atop the acknowledgements of <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/bookSearch/isbnInquiry.asp?r=1&popup=0&isbn=0740748475">The Complete Calvin and Hobbes</a>, a 30 lb., 3-volume boxed tome that contains every <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em> comic strip every drawn: </p>

<pre>"As flattering as it is to have a lavish book like this,
it can be a little disturbing to see one's own career
embalmed in a box..."</pre>

<p>The ingenuity is underscored by appropriateness. Watterson downplays the magnitude of the collection, yet the contents of the box contains a large staple of my childhood.</p>

<p>Another teriffic opening is on <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perltestingadn/desc.html">the back cover blurb for Perl Testing: A Developer's Notebook</a>, written by chromatic:</p>

<pre>"Can you think of a sexier topic in software development
than software testing?"</pre>

<p>If there's a hall of fame for this sort of thing, let me know. I have two nominations.
</p></p>

<h2>In My Defense...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2006-01-09T02:11:24</h3>
<p>I was thinking of Andy Lester when I wrote that, knowing full well that I'd have to apologize for it eventually.  Now I suspect I'll have to apologize for <em>this</em> comment too, also eventually.</p>



<h2>First sentence says it all</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mr_bean/">mr_bean</a> on 2006-01-09T05:38:04</h3>
Michael Hoey in a book about the relationship<br>between sentences in a text has a good first<br>sentence about the fact that if he could say all<br>he had to say in his book in one sentence, he<br>wouldn't have had to write the book.



<h2>I'm going to buy that set one day...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajtaylor/">ajtaylor</a> on 2006-01-10T08:27:46</h3>
I saw the set in Costco the other day - it's very impressive looking. I still laugh at Calvin and Hobbes, and I suspect I will continue to do so for another 15 years (at least).
