<p>No doubt we all get annoyed by some things and maybe a lot at some times.<br/><br/>Lately I've found I get annoyed by cellphone-owners. Not the cellphones themselves, no problem with them, I love my phone.<br/><br/>No, I have a problem with a certain aspect of having a cellphone. Lately I've noticed more and more people doing the following:<br/><br/>phone rings
owner looks annoyed
owner checks who calls
owner pick up
owner says "No, I don't have time right now, I'll call you right back."<br/><br/>
Hello? Never heard of voicemail? Never heard of *not* picking up when you don't have time?
Clearly you do have time, cause you pick up! And you can *see* who phones you and call them back without telling them you you don't have time.<br/><br/>Oh, just remembered something else. People I vaguely know phoning me and saying "call me back straight away cause I don't have any money left" or something like that, and hanging up before you can say something. Or discussing why not if you say "No, get lost." just before they hang up.<br/><br/>And those people who find out I happened to spend some time not in the NL and still insist on talking to me too long because hey, they don't have to pay for it! (I do, so I tend to keep it short)<br/><br/>Lovely how people do that (not).<br/><br/>And my phonecompany sucks.<br/><br/>Pff.</p>
