<p>I've been using the free komodo editor for the past few months - since I finally got too frustrated with the slow memory-hog that is Eclipse/EPIC (and this is /after/ recently upgrading to a new 2.2GHz dual-core 2GB ram machine).<br/><br/>I managed to buy one of the perl Dev-Kits that were auctioned off in Copenhagen last week.<br/><br/>There must have been a bit of confusion, as it was advertised as "including komodo", which it wasn't - but ActiveState were good enough to let me have a license for the Komodo IDE instead of the Dev-Kit, as that was what I was really interested in.<br/><br/>Within about ten seconds of loading the IDE up, I was grinning, and very happy with my purchase.
The subroutine select-menu, the code browser, svn integration, DOM browser - this is what eclipse/EPIC tries to be - but this fast!<br/><br/>Granted, I only paid 300 DKK, not the usual 295 USD - but now that I've seen the product and started working with it - I'll certainly be getting my $work to buy any upgrades that come out.</p>

I tried Kommodo IDE a couple of times. The feature set is impressive. But each time I gave it a try, I always returned to the "slow memory hog that is Eclipse/EPIC" because I found Kommodo to be an even slower, even more memory hogging piece of software.
