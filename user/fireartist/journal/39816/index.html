<div class="span8">
<p>I haven't used MS Windows as my main OS in around 3 years - not long after I created Vanilla Perl for Alias' "vertical metre of beer" contest, in fact.<br/><br/>For various reasons, I decided this Monday to switch from using Fedora and running Windows inside a virtual machine when necessary - to running Windows 7 as my main OS, and running Fedora inside a virtual machine when necessary.<br/><br/>After installation, I grabbed the latest Strawberry Perl installer and ran it - nice and quick, with no unnecessary questions.
Fired up a console - yup, perl.exe is in my path - nice.<br/><br/>Then I fired up the CPAN shortcut from the programs menu - `install HTML::FormFu` - completed with no errors - nice.
Same for Catalyst, DBIx::Class, HTML::FormFu::Model::DBIC, ...<br/><br/>Catalyst::Controller::HTML::FormFu failed with errors from WWW::Mechanize - but then that normally happens for me under linux too. If memory serves, I force installed WWW::Mechanize, installed Test::WWW::Mechanize, force installed Catalyst::Test::WWW::Mechanize, and then installed Catalyst::Controller::HTML::FormFu with all tests passing.<br/><br/>Tried installing DBD::mysql and after spending far too long battling with its Makefile.PL and then compilation errors, I thought "does Strawberry ship with a working PPM nowadays?" - and yes - it does!
Start a new console; ppm; install DBD::mysql.
very nice!<br/><br/>Yes, then I installed Padre with no errors :)
which isn't something I had managed to do under Fedora - after building a threading perl, I still couldn't get Wx to install.<br/><br/>I'm not complaining about the installation errors I did encounter - I consider having to work around occasional cpan errors as a small price to pay for the benefits that cpan modules give me - heck, my own modules aren't immune from installation errors occasionally.<br/><br/>What amazes me is - first, how far the Strawberry Perl community have taken the original Vanilla Perl hack and made it into an unrecognisably slick and usable product - and secondly, how their testing and feedback efforts have made Perl on Windows so much more viable and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Looking at strawberryperl.com and the win32.perl.org wiki, I can't even figure out who is currently working on the project - so thanks, whoever you are! ;)</p>

<h2>I guess I'll answer that...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/DiamondInTheRough/">DiamondInTheRough</a> on 2009-10-30T12:56:55</h3>
<p>and say "thank you".  It's basically a cooperation between 3 people now.</p><p>I'm the "coder" of the team that tries to make it all fit together on the perl end, Alias is the release manager, and kmx (he's not on use.perl, I don't think) helps us by building the c libraries and gcc toolchain binaries in order to be able to build Perl.</p>



<h2>One other thing...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/DiamondInTheRough/">DiamondInTheRough</a> on 2009-10-30T13:06:32</h3>
DBD::mysql should have been there already. We do build it in.



<h2>You made some lucky guesses...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2009-10-31T23:48:46</h3>
<p>Well, it seems to me that you made some lucky guesses. I didn't. I wish these were tips on a welcome page, either a HTML page that the installer opens at the end, or on an introduction page on Strawberry Perl's website, with the link shown at the end of the installation.</p><p>Something like this:</p><p> <b>Welcome to Strawberry Perl</b> </p><ul>
<li> <p>Strawberry Perl put itself in your <code>PATH</code>. So go ahead, open a <code>cmd</code> console window, and type "<code>perl -V</code>".</p></li><li> <p>Strawberry Perl comes with a preconfigured <code>CPAN.pm</code>, a <code>make</code> tool, and a C compiler. Everything you need to install modules. Click on the "<code>CPAN</code> Client" link in the start menu, and you can start installing modules from the CPAN shell.</p></li><li> <p>But that may take quite some time! Strawberry Perl now can also install precompiled modules via PPM. Open a console window, type "<code>PPM</code>" and you're in our console based PPM shell, ready to go.</p></li></ul>
