<p>Work was so-so. I got some things done, but not enough of them on Epitaxy::Substrate, which really does want some more work done against it. I need to abstract Epitaxy::Persister, I think, to handle all Epitaxy objects, as I did with the Renderer. I don't like having no one with whom to talk about these ideas, though, and it's really demotivating. I'm not sure I've been able to have a technical discussion about proprietary work code with another programmer, ever. I mean, I've tried, but it doesn't come together.<br/><br/>
On the weekend, Casey West and I (and some others) had talked about a way to return really simple-but-useful values from subs, and we said that it would be keen to write some kind of Return::Value class to provide simple functions to do just that. I said I'd have a go at it this week, and yesterday I got it all working. Casey also decided to write an implementation, and put it on the CPAN yesterday afternoon. I was a little tweaked, but got over it, and sent him a patch to make his code more like mine, where mine was better (and leave it the same, where his was better). I also changed a bunch of the interface, so I'm guessing that the next actual release will look like a compromise between his implementation and mine, and that's good.<br/><br/>So, really, despite being initially annoyed at the conflict, I'm pretty happy to be collaborating with another human being. I also think Return::Value is going to be darn useful.</p>
