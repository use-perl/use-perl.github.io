<p><html><p>A few months ago, I spend a few days (yes, days) rewriting an extremely complex set of procmail programs into modern Perl.  Replacing procmail with Moose? Priceless.</p><p>Anyway, the procmail program largely existed to send mail to a program written for Perl 4.  It had no strictures and no useful tests.</p><p>When I finally threw the big switch and started to send mail through the real Perl 4 program instead of the mock version, I ended up with mail records like this:</p><pre>From: icardo Signes   Subject: his is a test
</pre><p>What?  Why did that happen?  Well, this line exists in the code.</p><pre>$subject = substr($subject, 1) if ($subject[0] == " ");
</pre><p>The intent is &#34;clearly&#34; to remove a single leading whitespace if it exists.  Of course, that&#39;s not what the code actually says.  It says, &#34;If the first element of an array called @subject is a single space, then remove the first character from the scalar $string.&#34;</p><p>This didn&#39;t throw a compile-time error (about @subject not being declared) because the program didn&#39;t (and more or less cannot, yet) use strict.  This didn&#39;t display any bad behavior because all of the program&#39;s input had one leading whitespace.</p><p>The fix was easy.  I threw in a `s/^\s+//&#39;.  Still... what an excellent demonstration of the power of strictures to remind you that HEY! you&#39;re programming Perl here, not Python. </p></html>

<p>Don't you mean "eq" too?</p>

<p>The person should've used eq, but then it would've failed.  @string didn't exist, so $string[0] was undef, which is ne " ".  They used ==, though, so they got undef-as-num (0) == " "-as-num (0) and it was true.</p><p>Lots of nice bugs in that one line.</p>
