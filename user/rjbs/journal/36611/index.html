<p><html><p>I&#39;ve been wanting to do some mucking around with POD.  I started a little down
this route a few weeks ago with
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Pod-Coverage-TrustPod/">Pod::Coverage::TrustPod</a>,
and what I found was that it was really a pain in the butt to easily say, &#34;this
file contains POD.  Give me the content of hunks between <code>=begin foo</code> and <code>=end
foo</code>.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s possible, and that if you understand Pod::Simple you can
do it fairly quickly, but I just got too confused and side-tracked trying to
figure it out.  I really just wanted to get a hunk of data by saying something
like:</p><pre>my @hunks = Pod::Imaginary->parse('file.pm')->for_formatter('foo');
</pre><p>Later, this sort of thing started to bite me again, because Pod::Simple seems
much more geared to... well, to getting things right.  I mean, it doesn&#39;t want
you to make up directives all over the place, it understands the relationship
between over and item, and it cares about what&#39;s inside of text paragraphs
(like C&#60;&#62; and all that).</p><p>After talking about it with Dieter for a while and growing more grumpy, I
realized that this was just like the INI parsing situation.  POD is just a line
oriented data format.  I could just write a little state machine to collect POD
events and do whatever I wanted.</p><p>So, Wednesday after ABE.pm, I wrote Pod::Eventual.  It reads POD and collects
lines into events, which look something like these:</p><pre>my @events = (
  { type => 'command', command => 'head1', content => "NAME\n" },
  { type => 'text',    content => "Pod::Eventual - read POD as events\n" },
);
</pre><p>Sure, it doesn&#39;t realize that most people would consider that text paragraph to
be &#34;part of&#34; the header.  That&#39;s fine!  It means it also doesn&#39;t need to be
special cased the other way to handle this:</p><pre>=for HTML
<hr />

...and now some text!
</pre><p>In that case, the paragraph is definitely <em>not</em> part of the <code>for</code> construct.</p><p>Pod::Simple works something like this, under the hood, but it&#39;s much more
complicated.  Pod::Eventual ignores the structure of the document beyond
paragraphs, and it doesn&#39;t look at the content of the text paragraphs.  It also
might just get some cases wrong.  (Failing tests welcome!)</p><p>Still, it makes it very easy to write quick (but accurate) POD handling code.</p><p>My hunk-finder from above could probably be:</p><pre>my @hunks = grep {
  $_->{content} =~ /^foo$/m
  and ($_->{command} =~ 'begin' .. $_->{command} =~ 'end')
} Pod::Eventual->read_file('file.pm');
</pre><p>...or something very like it.</p></html>
