<p><html><p>After my last set of poking at making Addex do 7-bitization of funny
characters, I did some more poking around and learned some things that helped
me get everything working just fine.  I&#39;ve made a new release of Addex and the
Apple address book plugin, so now anyone can have his friend JosÃÂ© show
up with an alias of <code>jose</code> by updating his Addex config to include:</p><pre>[App::Addex::Output::Mutt]
unidecode = 1
</pre><p>This replaced my lousy unicode-to-ascii conversion with Sean M. Burke&#39;s
presumably awesome Text::Unidecode.  It catches every case I caught, and
probably a lot more that I haven&#39;t had to worry about yet.  I saw the tests
spitting bizarre southeast Asian characters to the screen and was glad I never
had to think about it.</p><p>I also found out that the simple rule with Mac::Glue is that you either get
back Unicode or MacRoman.  From looking at the source, I think the Unicode will
always be in a string that <code>is_utf8</code>, so I just decode any non-<code>is_utf8</code> string
from MacRoman.</p><p>Having done that, without using Text::Unidecode, mutt was still confused.  Then
I realized that it was all my fault:  I was not setting the write filehandle to
utf8 mode, so the bytes were getting mangled.  Once I did that, the file made a
lot more sense.  Of course, it still meant that I would have to type in funny
characters if they were in the &#34;before I hit tab to tab complete&#34; part of a
name, so I still wanted to downgrade to the English alphabet.  Text::Unidecode
quietly replaced my code, and then I added a config option and it&#39;s done.
Anyone using Addex with contacts who have silly foreign names should update.
My mutt is a lot nicer to look at now.</p></html>
