<p>Tonight, I was struck by an urge to JFDI.  For a long time, I've wanted a better way to organize my Netflix queue.  There used to be Netflix Freak, which was decent, but cost money, and I think it went away.  I think it had other problems, I just can't remember anymore.<br/><br/>Anyway, what I really wanted was a way to save my queue to a text file, edit the file, and then upload it again.  It should have been simple, but the form used on Netflix is pretty ugly, and I was having a hell of a time figuring out how to deal with it using TokeParser, which is built in to Mech.  I knew it wasn't the right sort of parser, but I didn't know what was better.  Finally, I asked #perl where I could get something to say "for each div of class foo, do X."  DrForr pointed me toward HTML::Tree, which made this task incredibly simple.<br/><br/>Now I can save my queue, rearrange the file, and update my queue.  No more trying to remember what number I put in front of what, no more trying to keep lots of changes in my head at once.  I put the lines in the order I want and hit "go!"  It doesn't delete or add movies yet, but I may (or may not) add that.  Tomorrow I'll probably collect these two little hacks into one program with some command line switches.<br/><br/>In the meantime, I would like everyone to know that Sean Burke and Andy Lester deserve candy and hugs for giving away such great toolkits. </p>

<p>My hammer of choice is forcing the input to XHTML using HTMLTidy, then attacking it with XPath. XPath rocks extremely hard. HTML::Tidy (there&#8217;s Andy Lester again) and XML::LibXML are excellent tools for this approach.</p>

Do you really need to tidy first?  I just make sure recover mode is turned on and use LibXML's parse_html method - works for me.  Maybe you have to deal with uglier HTML than I do.

<p>I didn&#8217;t think of that because I actually use XSLT most of the time (nowadays a Perl wrapper script around XML::LibXSLT and the aforementioned modules), and there&#8217;s something really strange going on with namespaces in a DOM built using libxml&#8217;s HTML parser, which causes strange misbehaviour in XSL transforms that I never figured out (just had hours of debugging fun with). When I started out, I didn&#8217;t even have the option because I was in fact using libxslt&#8217;s <code>xsltproc</code> utility, and that doesn&#8217;t even a way to parse HTML input.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re actually just parsing the input using libxml and then do all the work in Perl, you can probably get away without turning things into XHTML first, you&#8217;re right.</p>

Of course, now what you need to do is make one script that, on startup, downloads your queue to a tmp file, spawn the editor, checks for changes on exit, and if changed uploads it back to netflix, all in one step.

Actually, what I did was create<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:getQueue and<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:pushQueue.  I think that I'm more comfortable being explicit: I don't want to hit the wrong few keys and accidentally delete all the movies from my queue!
