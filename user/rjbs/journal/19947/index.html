<p>A few quick notes:<br/><br/>I've sent Jos a patch to Config::Auto to make it Do What I Want. I hope it goes through.<br/><br/>Today is my birthday. I have survived 25 years, possibly a full tenth of my life. Hooray for me! Gloria is taking me for super-tasty dinner at the Apollo Grill tonight. I may attempt to get Trevor to buy me a slice of pizza at lunch, too.<br/><br/>Of the top ten pre-ordered electronics products at Amazon, nine are Apple products. Of the top five, five are iPod minis. Wow!<br/><br/>Someone (we suspect it was Gloria's dad) sent me an anonymous Amazon gift cert. (The anonymity may have been a mistake. We're doing some research.) I'm pondering using it toward an AirPort Express. I'm not sure. I might just wait until Pikmin 2 is out. The certificate is good until 2006!<br/><br/>Last night I went cycling around the northeast end of city. Well, actually the northeast end of the inner part of city. I didn't venture far into the townships. It was a good ride. I saw some neighborhoods I hadn't seen before, and I think I did a full hour, which is better than I've been doing lately.<br/><br/>I totally failed to produce an entry for IntroComp.<br/><br/>Birthday Week Present (Sunday): Day of the Dead<br/><br/>Gloria had never seen Day of the Dead, though I've subjected her to Night and Dawn a number of times. We watched it Sunday. She wasn't impressed. I wasn't impressed when I first saw it either, and my opinion hasn't changed much. Still, it's good to have the whole trilogy! Zombies RULE!<br/><br/>Birthday Week Present (Monday): A Quarter Century of Unix Birthday Present: The UNIX Philosophy<br/><br/>
OSCON flight reading, I think.</p>

Man, you're really looking to live a long time!

My goal is forever, but I'm being conservative, so as to avoid disappointment.

Being a Conservative is all about being disappointed.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
