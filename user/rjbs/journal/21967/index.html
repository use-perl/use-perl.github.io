<p>I want to play more chess.  By "more" I mean "more than one game each year."<br/><br/>I don't want to play random people, I want to play against people I know, or at least have some reason to socialize with, other than "FICS says we're a match level-wise."<br/><br/>The problem is that when I ask someone if he'd like to play, he always responds, "You'd kick my ass."  I guess people think I'm a chess fanatic.  I'm not.  Even if I have it in me to kick ass, I get no practice, because no one will play with me.  I gave up on go (sort of) because no one wanted to learn, and I figured that chess would be easier: most people already know how. Everybody says they like chess, but nobody wants to play.  I don't get it. </p>

I can play against my wife though - she's roughly on my level.<p>
I enjoy playing in Yahoo games (my rating there fluctuates between 1500 and 1600).</p>

<p>Ask on <code>#perlde</code> on IRC. They seem to like chess there. And you can learn German for free, as a side effect<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

I'm in the same boat.  I make it to a local chess club occasionally and a tournament once in a blue moon.  I'm starting to get the girls interested at home, but they are a long ways off from being a challenge.

I'll play you, if you can find a Mac Internet chess client.<br> <br>I suck at chess, but eh.
