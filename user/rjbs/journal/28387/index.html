<p>John C. and I were talking, for a few months, about getting a new rackmount and colocating it somewhere.  That didn't happen, but he did find a really great deal on a nice virtual server package, from <a href='http://www.aktiom.com'>Aktiom</a>  <br/><br/>For some reason, I was initially really tentative about moving things there. First, I moved my non-personal Subversion repositories, then some other little tidbits of data.  This weekend, I moved over my main web pages, including rjbs.manxome.org, which took quite a good while.  At home, since May, I've only had about 128 Kbps upstream, or maybe 384.  I don't recall.  Anyway, it's not very fast, considering that I host a lot of images.  Uploading about two gigs of data to the virt took hours, but now my pages should be significantly faster.<br/><br/>The next step is probably to move my mail service, but we'll need to figure out our strategy for virtual users a bit better, for that.  I'm hoping it will all go well.<br/><br/>One thing that this (and other recent work) has driven home is that I need to do more work with PostgreSQL again.  I used to use it quite a bit, for personal projects, but eventually I slacked off and shoved everything in SQLite.  This weekend I found myself struggling with access control, mostly because I didn't remember stupid things like how DBD::Pg would decide how to connect to a server (that is, unix sockets or TCP sockets).<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to more fun with the new box, including more time playing with RT. </p>
