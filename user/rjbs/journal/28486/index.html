<p>Rubric has had a CLI since forever.  It has basically been a bunch of crappy little scripts that did one or two things each, badly, with lousy command line processing.  I really want to fix this, since one of the biggest complaints I get is that it's too hard for muggles to install Rubric.  I'd like to eliminate any need for people who have no clue to ask for help installing things.<br/><br/>Beyond that, I'd like to have a command useful enough to install in the path to take care of any Rubric needs, from installing a new Rubric to managing users, to exporting datasets to a flatfile, to performing database management.<br/><br/>I'm not using all my favorite tools, because some of them aren't on the CPAN yet.  We have a little CLI toolkit at work that I'd really like to make into its own distribution and rely on.  It does a little bit of this and a little bit of that, and just makes script-writing easier.  I am using Dieter's killer Getopt::Long::Descriptive, which is nice.  I'd like to make rubric(1) act something like svk(1), which is what I had in mind when I started writing Rubric::CLI.  A bit later that evening, I saw that SVK uses App::CLI, which looks like it was split off from SVK.  Unfortunately it's underdocumented, and I'd rather not lose momentum to figure it out.  I'll either get Rubric::CLI up to its level, or refactor later.<br/><br/>I fixed a bug or two, and I'm starting to feel like I'm getting somewhere.<br/><br/>So far, though, no real progress on the official Rubric Gallery setup.  I need to JFDI. </p>
