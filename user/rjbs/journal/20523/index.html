<p>So, I really like Module::Starter.  There are a number of little things in it that bug me, but mostly they only bug me because of the way they're coded or because of the way I want to extend them.  In other words, they're things that wouldn't bother users (I think).<br/><br/>The big thing that's annoying as a user is the lack of a configuration file. As you've seen if you've used it -- especially with plugins -- the command line can get stupidly large.  I fixed this for me, first with an alias and then with a script.  Of course, if the point of sharing software is to help make everyone's life easier, it doesn't make a lot of sense to release software that needs a wrapper just to be a non-pain to use.  I'm trying to make the module-starter program easy for anyone to use without a wrapper or a half dozen command-line options.<br/><br/>The obvious thing to do is make a configuration file, which has been vexing me for a long time.  I was growing thought-sick, and I have decided to take drastic measures and write the simplest thing that will possibly work: a simple configuration file with the basic options in it.  Everything else can happen later.  If I have a totally awesome idea, in a few months, about how to make the config file better, so be it.  It probably won't make this file format obsolete, so who cares?  I want people to be able to just run "module-starter --module Honk::Honk::Simple" and have things work.  This does that.<br/><br/>It should be on the CPAN this week, after some more testing and poking around.<br/><br/>Another item of interest in Module::Starter is a link to Module::Release.  I really like Module::Release.  It's good.  I was introduced to it by Andy, who was already using it for Module::Starter before I got on board.  Yesterday and today I took some time to update some of my old code and release the updates with Module::Release.  It catches a lot of my stupid screw-ups, and I know that with a little more messing around I can make it catch more.<br/><br/>So, Bisbee has suggested that module-starter should create a .releaserc in the standard distribution skeleton.  It would be easy -- really, really easy.  I'm just not sure I want to start adding new features to module-starter.  Andy and I have talked about how there are two classes of potential M::S user.  There are newbie authors who need a system that's as simple as possible, so they can just write their code and go; then there are "power users" who write a lot of modules and want to be able to customize the tool to work just they way they like.<br/><br/>The key to making everyone happy is to keep those two use cases distinct.  I don't want the simple users to have to install plugins and muck about with TT2, which means I need to avoid the idea that the basic distribution should contain a big smorgasboard of useful and simple features.  So, what features are the key features?  A few months ago I would have even argued that Module::Build is a luxury.  Now, that idea sounds silly to me.  I'm not sure where I'll end up thinking Module::Release belongs -- but I sure want to think about it before I add it.  Otherwise, it'll never come out. </p>
