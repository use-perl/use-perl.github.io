<p><html><p>A while ago, I did a bit of work applying patches to MIME::Lite.  It&#39;s the most widely depended upon of the dists I maintain, and one of the oldest, with the most RT tickets.  I also don&#39;t really like it very much, so it doesn&#39;t get as much work as I&#39;d like to give it.</p><p>Anyway, I recently applied a patch from one of those tickets, which was marked as being the patch that Debian used.  In the changelog, I put a snarky remark about Debian maintainers being jerks and not sending me (the upstream maintainer) their patch.</p><p>It was then pointed out to me that they had, in fact, sent me the patch, that it was in a ticket, and that I had marked it resolved.</p><p>So, hey, Debian guys who might be reading this and whom I didn&#39;t already apologize to:  I&#39;m sorry.  What was I thinking?  Well, clearly I wasn&#39;t.</p><p>After giving people a hard time about giving people a hard time, I should really know better.  I will endeavor to be better about sticking to my own rule: don&#39;t be snarky. </p></html>

<p>I use the "hated by you" MIME::Lite. It is fairly simple to get it to do what I want. What module or modules would you recommend to replace it that would give me the same functionality?</p><p>Kudos to you for owning up to a mistake.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
