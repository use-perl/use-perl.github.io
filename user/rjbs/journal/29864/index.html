<div class="span8">
<p><p>I recently bought a used Nokia 6620.  For the most part, it's been a decent phone.  I can use it to make calls, get online, and play Frozen Bubble.  It's had a few quirks, though, which seem to affect my battery life.  Also, I can't reassign all of the buttons on it.  I think these problems are caused by my ancient firmware.  In fact, I know some of them are:  John as a newer version of the firmware and can reprogram a number of the buttons that I can't.</p>

<p>I went to Nokia's web site to download newer firmware.  I couldn't find it, so I went to Google.  Google found a number of forum posts indicating that only Nokia can update a phone's firmware.</p>

<p>Irritated, but still determined, I went back to Nokia's site to find out what I had to do.  They had a service center locator, but all form submissions went to a 404 error.  I called them, today, and spoke with a CSR in the repair department.  First, she told me that I can't just get my software updated; they won't flash it unless there's a problem.  I told her about my issues and she said that I could send it in for repairs.  The downside: there was no guarantee they'd flash my firmware, and there would be a minimum $100 charge.  I asked about local repair centers and she said, "We don't have 'authorized repair centers,' and if we did, the same charge would apply."</p>

<p>"Okay," I said, "I'll throw it away and buy a Motorola, I guess."  She didn't care.  (Big surprise.)</p>

<p>What this incident tells me is that if a Nokia phone gets better over time, an early adopter can't benefit from those improvements.  Further, a late adopter can't benefit by buying a phone late in its life cycle, if that phone is old stock.   In other words, Nokia doesn't really care about their customer's experience.</p>

<p>I think my plan is going to have to be only buy phones that have user-installable firmware updates.  I'll probably wait another year, though. I'm not anxious to drop another hundred dollars on a phone any time soon. </p>

<h2>Why should they care?</h2>

<p>Most users won&#8217;t either. They have no idea what firmware is or that it can be upgraded. By ignoring people like you, they lose a tiny amount of customers and save a lot of money on support calls (assuming flashing a cell phone is still as precarious an activity as it used to be).</p>

<p>It sucks, but there isn&#8217;t any reason for them to go after your business.</p>

I'm pretty sure I went to a carphone warehouse in the UK about 3 years ago with my Nokia 6600 and I asked for a firmware upgrade and they just did it with no questions asked and no charge.

<p>Yes, but that&#8217;s not an official procedure and if anything goes wrong, it&#8217;s not Nokia who&#8217;s liable (if anyone at all&#8230;).</p>
