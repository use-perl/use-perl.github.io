<p>Today, the Church got a new pope.  I'm waiting to see how it goes.  I'm all for orthodoxy, but I know there's a lot of grumbling over the supression of free thought over the last twenty years.  (Or, as the Church calls it, "heresy.")<br/><br/>Today on IRC, the election of the pope caused a lot of banter, which is to be expected.  I also expected that lots of the banter would be irreverant, which I'm pretty used to.  Why should I expect anyone revere the same things I do?<br/><br/>Sometimes, though, I'm surprised when the normal IRC tactlessness gives way to something that seems to me beyond the pale.  Today, someone got into a pretty heated line of ranting about the church that included the line (and this is nearly the quote), "The Catholic Church is no different from the Nazi party."<br/><br/>There didn't seem to be any discussing the point, so I left.<br/><br/>Yesterday, I was feeling the same kind of awkward discomfort when people were praising Castro for "annoying the US."  Meanwhile, I have family unable to express themselves in public or, say, buy milk.<br/><br/>One of the things that drove me away from #kuro5hin, some years ago, was the declaration that a DEA agent who had died accidentally while doing yardwork had "gotten what he deserved" and that the speaker was "totally happy" about it. This wasn't some specific agent, it was just a nameless person who had died unfortunately.<br/><br/>I'm all for IRC being brutish and crass, but I keep thinking that there's some underlying etiquette.  I think I'm wrong. </p>

than anywhere else. And, really, people should be reminded of the crusades and the inquisition far more often than the Catholic Church currently allows as they were brutal, murderous thugs for almost 100 years. Killing entire races of people for a religion or for an ideology are not terribly different. As a recovering Catholic I can see how someone made that analogy.

The difference is that the killing done by the Catholic Church was an anomaly in the history of Catholicism, and altogether antithetical to the modern and original views of the Catholic Church, unlike Nazism, which was founded on the views it killed people over.<br>

I know better than to reply....100 years and the crusades before then were not entirely what I would call an anomaly any more than the rather unplanned manner in which the 'final solution' was arrived at by the Nazi's. Extremism tends to make people crazy, moreso when there's religion involved. Perhaps if Hitler had made the Nazi party a religion it might have lasted longer and been thought of us just an anomaly by now.

<p>I know better than to reply, too, but I'm a fool.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>You seem to be accusing pudge of playing a word game with the word "anomaly," but you didn't really address his definition of the word, which seems to fit: the beginnings of the movement condemned that behavior, the moderns in the movement condemn that behavior, so apparently everything that is official within the movement other than the contemporaries back then state that the behavior was unjustified, unauthorized, and only claimed to be taken legitimately in the name of that movement.</p>

<p>IIRC one of the Commandments was against taking the name of God in vain.  I imagine there will be quite a stiff punishment for those who want to apply the name of Jesus to killing, considering the Man Himself advocated a radical pacifism even in the face of injustice.</p>

<p>I don't know, I just <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jdavidb/journal/17518" title="perl.org">can't hold people responsible for the crimes of their ancestors</a perl.org>.  The perpetrators are long dead, and the people there today repudiate the behavior.  Comparing the Catholic Church of the past to the Nazis might be apropos.  But the same comparison does not fit the institution today.</p>

I never said I was impartial. But tell me how the Catholic church gets a pass as an 'anomaly' and forgiveness after centuries of killing people yet the Nazi get the scorn for being monsters. I don't necessarily attack religion, just churches like Catholicism with centuries of death and destruction in their wake.

The catholic church was founded much like any other organized religion...it had no loftier goal than to spread their belief and, well before the reformation and the enlightenment, rule countries via leaders and cunning politics. The Nazi's did not run on a platform of killing the infirm, the insane, or genocide, but, then again, they didn't pretend to be on a mission of salvation either. You should read a bit about the Wansee meeting and how it came to be. You might also look into some of the allegations on Pius XII. The church today is the same one that existed 500 years ago only with little power to play enforcers of the faith when there are few faithful left, especially in Europe. I have little doubt that had the reformation never come, we'd still be illiterates believing the world is flat and fearing an angry god lest we fear an angry inquisitor.

An interesting article about Herr Panzerpope and Bush this morning included a quote from Madison - "What influence in fact have ecclesiastical establishments had on Civil Society? In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of the Civil authority; in many instances they have been seen upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been seen the guardians of the liberties of the people. Rulers who wished to subvert the public liberty may have found an established Clergy convenient auxiliaries. A just Government instituted to secure &amp; perpetuate it needs them not."</p>
<p>
Christians serving death to those they see fit to die may be anathema to the 'founding priciples' and yet it is far from being an anomaly since it happened throughout history too often to qualify as such.

Perhaps you mean it to apply to the Vatican, but I doubt Madison would think that wise, since the Vatican is an entirely different sort of government.<br> <br>And you should be careful about quoting Madison, as he disagreed strongly with your view of the role of the federal government.  He was the ardent defender of the principle that the federal government should fund no social programs of any sort, and that any attempt to read the phrase "general welfare" as blanket permission to fund anything the government felt like funding was unwarranted.  Out of all the most important founding fathers, I suspect you would disagree with him the most, or close to it.  Maybe Adams, then Madison.<br>

You are misreading what I'm saying and, instead, splitting hairs and introducing things that have nothing to do with the original point of this which was - that organized religion such as the Catholic church and the Nazis share enough in political machinations and killing people to be logically compared. Regardless of the illusion of founding ideals that have plagued so many political bodies such as the church or the nazis, killing those opposed has not been an unusal occurance throughout history and still continues even now. The fact that the church worships some unseen and unverified mystical power as opposed to, say, Hitler or patriotic might is irrelevant. It's all about power and money. The church might have been about Peter a millenium ago but that time is long ago and, again, pointless to suggest that this is what the current church is about since it isn't currently killing masses of people. I'm sure Peter wouldn't be all that approving of molesting little boys which, at least when I was in Catholic school, common. And whether or not the church has been involved in mass killings of late, it also has done nothing to stop them either aside from saying that they condemn it which is quite really nothing.

<p>
I'm aware of the context of that quote from Madison and, since he was living during the time of enlightenment and the rejection of the church of state affairs due to a long history of the church meddling to no good end was apropos. That I would disagree with his policies is irrelevent. I could have chosen any number of quotes from the founding fathers as I recall all of them felt very similarly towards organized religion.

I seriously doubt that the person that said<blockquote> <div> <tt>"The Catholic Church is no different from the Nazi party."</tt> </div> </blockquote>really cares about the views of the Catholic Church, their intents, or whether the Crusades were an "anomaly" (interesting word to describe 250 years of activity). They are most likely equally apathetic towards knowing about the Nazi party.<br> <br>Both groups killed large numbers of people using religous belief as a litmus test.<br> <br>If that is the criteria for comparison, then they are the same. (Some Jews call the Crusades the "first holocost", if you are looking for more similarity.)<br> <br>Naturally, one (probably both) of these groups would like for the criteria to be expanded so that they aren't "the same".<br> <br>

I should have just said, "stop using damned comparisons and labels to make your case, just tell me what you find to be wrong with the Catholic church."<br> <br>Arguing over what is and is not under a given label, or what is like something else, is just a sideshow, a way to avoid actually defining something according to truth, by using innuendo instead.<br>

<h2>My take</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2005-04-20T13:40:53</h3>
<p>You know, I <i>don't</i> believe the Pope is the successor to Peter, and I <i>don't</i> believe he has any authority over me, and I <i>do</i> believe the men in that office and their subordinates have made blatant obvious changes to the tradition handed down by the apostles.  But I do believe in giving decent respect to a man honored by millions.  I did pray for those grieving the loss of the previous Pope, and there were public prayers offered to that effect at our church meetings, even though they agree with me about the theology of the Papacy.  I do believe he was a good man, and Ratzinger seems to have a similar record.  (To be honest, I admire his statements about the deficiencies of Protestant churches.)  And I don't believe in holding people responsible for the crimes of their ancestors: medieval persecutions and pograms were committed by people long dead.</p>

<p>But I also know that it's a wild and wooly net out there, and that most people hate religion and almost all expressions of it, especially organized religious expression.  And a lot of people want to blame religion, and especially the Catholic Church, for most of the world's problems.  They are wrong.</p>

<p>I really appreciated <a href="http://heartkeepercommonroom.blogspot.com/2005/04/our-condolences.html" title="blogspot.com">this post</a blogspot.com> by a homeschooling mother from my own faith, who stated that while she certainly has some differences with the Catholic Church, she knows that now is not the time.  She's also interested in <a href="http://heartkeepercommonroom.blogspot.com/2005/04/we-are-not-catholic.html" title="blogspot.com">educating</a blogspot.com> herself, her children, and her readers on the Papacy without being critical.</p>

I only have academic problems with the Catholic Church, as a unit.  I disagree with it on many things, but nothing that matters in practical life.  I've got the same goals they do, and as such, I am all for their health and have a more than a mere passing interest in their leadership, and I am encouraged that the Church decided to make a solid and deliberate stand for orthodoxy.<br> <br>Even if I were not a Christian, I would be heartened by the move.  One of the greatest problems today is well-demonstrated by rjbs' notes, though I would offer a different interpretation: it's not about being brutish and crass, but about rejecting orthodoxy, just because it is orthodoxy, what Benedict XVI called in his introductory address "relativism."<br> <br>The Catholic Church represents authority and conservatism and orthodoxy; therefore, it is evil.<br> <br>Same with the U.S.  And despite Cuba's many terrible evils, Castro is a hero because he stands up against the U.S.<br> <br>Same with the DEA agent.  He was an agent of orthodoxy.<br> <br>And the reason for the brutishness and crassness is, I believe, in part because there is no rational argument to support the views.  It's difficult to argue what they feel, that the Church and the U.S. are bad because they are powerful and orthodox.  So they make outrageous comparisons and charges intended to both reflect their deep feelings, and deflect any possibility at rational debate which would expose the view as shallow.<br>

<p>Hmm.  I think you are right, generally speaking.  And I think suddenly I understand people just a little bit more.</p>

<p>Like you, I'm encouraged to hear the Catholic Church stick to its guns on Orthodoxy, even on those issues I don't agree with.  Even if it should mean they want to say that I am condemned for not being a Catholic.</p>
