<h2>Fun on Sourceforge</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2008-06-24T20:28:54</h3>
Last week I wanted to report a bug on a Sourceforge project. I could choose between logging in with a Sourceforge ID, or with an OpenID. I thought that, since I had neither, perhaps getting an OpenID might be the more universally useful approach. So it took me almost half an hour to read up on what an OpenID is, and how to make it work... Eventually, I got me one.

<p>So happily, I used it to log into Sourceforge... It worked. And next, it required me to get a Sourceforge account.</p>

The Sourceforge user name and password are used for CVS and other SF tools(? - definitely CVS) that aren't OpenID-capable. For most other websites that won't be the case.

<h2>My Ubuntu Saga</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Shlomi Fish/">Shlomi Fish</a> on 2008-06-24T21:08:15</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/11379.html" title="livejournal.com">I describe a similar, (but tangential) problem with Ubuntu</a livejournal.com> on my blog. The first comment misses the point that while my email was annoying, it was still good-intentioned, and that I should be treated with more restraint.
</p>

<p>
But the problem was that Ubuntu kept thinking <b>I</b> owed them something and that I should jump through hoops to try to remedy their problems. I'm a happy Mandriva (Cooker) user myself, and while I'm trying to promote FOSS in general, I'm glad I have enough options to choose from.
</p>

<p>
Whenver someone reports a bug, I know well-enough to say: "You're right, it's an issue in my code (or an undocumented/counter-intuitive/not-perfecly-allowed behaviour. It's my fault. I'll fix it." Ubuntu on the other hand, claimed that <b>I</b> should bother enough to go through their red tape trying to fix an issue I know they have.
</p>

<p>
The user is king, and many people don't realise it. Ubuntu messed royally with Ubuntu Hardy (which I call "Ubuntu Hardly") which I've heard some horror stories of. In Israel alone, two famous FOSS developers and bloggers have happily switched to Mandriva (and blogged about it), and another one said she's planning to switch to Debian. I also tried to help two people on #perl with installing perfectly good CPAN modules on Hardy, which failed from some reason. (One of them now owes me a beer, if I'll ever come to Rome. )
</p>

<p>
I don't know if it's related to the problems I've encountered, but it seems likely that Ubuntu will lose mind-share among the power users/developers and evidently among more mundane users too.

<h2>User experience design failure</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hex/">hex</a> on 2008-06-29T01:52:37</h3>
There are sites - I forget which, but I've seen some - that require a user account, but integrate the signup process into using the site for the first time. How I'd implement it for a bugtracker:
<p>
Box for your new bug title. Box for your new bug text. Box for your email address. Submit button.
</p><p>
When you hit submit, one of those nice CSS-powered dialog boxes (such as use.perl is now using for login) appears and says "We haven't seen you before, please enter a password to log in next time." You enter a password and click the button. Boom, you have a user account. It's up to you if you ever use it again, but the effort of getting it is minimized.
</p>



<h2>Bad user experience design</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hex/">hex</a> on 2008-06-29T02:02:58</h3>
Some recent sites - I forget which - integrate account generation into the first time you use the site, which makes it a seamless experience. Pretty simple - enter your bug text, and email address; after you submit, it asks you to pick a password, and there you have it, a user account. I wish more sites would (hear of and) adopt this model.
<p>
Secondary gripe: the "repeat your password" box. Most people are fairly good at typing and this only serves as an annoyance. Whatever site it was that introduced me to this new sign-up style didn't bother, and I think they made the right choice. If someone does screw up typing, that's what the "Can't login?" link (AKA "Forgot Password", but that's bad phrasing) is for.
