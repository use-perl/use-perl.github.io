<p><html><p>The svideo out on my MacBook has never, as far as I know, worked. I didn&#39;t bother getting it repaired because I never needed to use it. Now a larger problem has cropped up: I no longer seem able to connect my flat panel to my MacBook. I can use my work flat panel, presumably because I&#39;m using an analog connection. At home, using a DVI connection, it fails. Another laptop works on my flat panel, but I can only test it with analog. I need to get someone with a DVI out on his laptop to come swing by.</p><p>Of course this has come up about two days after my AppleCare expired. Fortunately American Express doubles the warranty on all my purchases, up to an additional year. I called to file a claim, and I&#39;m not sure how this will work. I got the impression that they might just replace the device or refund the purchase price, both of which would probably leave me with a better model. That would be fantastic. Even if they just cover the repair charges, that&#39;s great. I really enjoy the extra benefits programs that American Express sprinkles here and there. I use them very rarely, but they&#39;re always great when I do.</p><p>Also, this week I declined to renew my AAA membership, because AmEx has introduced their own free roadside protection. It&#39;s not quite as good as AAA, but for $130 less each year, I&#39;m all over it. Heck, with that and some huge savings on laptop repair, maybe I&#39;ll use those savings to upgrade to a platinum card... then again, almost all of its benefits are geared toward travellers, and I&#39;m hardly one of those. Still... some silly little part of me imagines that I&#39;d get rushed through call queues, called &#34;sir,&#34; and that I&#39;d one day benefit from free use of the airport admiral&#39;s club. </p></html>
