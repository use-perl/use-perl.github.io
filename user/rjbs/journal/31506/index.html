<p><p>Hooray for being home!  Gloria and I had a number of good experiences on our trip to Florida, but it's always nice to get home.  Some people (mostly those who don't know me very well) laugh when I say that I'm a boring homebody, but it's really true.  Since we returned home, Gloria and I have enjoyed lounging around the house, watching the TiVo backlog, and cuddling with our guinea pigs.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had Able Roofers by to give us an estimate (I don't have it in writing yet, but it seems like things will be pretty inexpensive), so I stayed home.  Or, rather, I didn't go in on an off day to make up for time away. Today I headed in to the office for the first time in over a week, and it was good.  Even when it makes me crazy (as it was not doing today), I like my job, and it was nice to get back to a more concrete work schedule after a week of working just when I had a bit of time.</p>

<p>We've established a pretty ambitious timetable for the rest of the year, and I'm really looking forward to getting to work on making it happen.</p>

<p>After work today, I stuck around Philly and went out for dinner with John.  We went to a wine bar around 13th and Sansom, Vintage.  The bartenders (whom John knew) were really on the ball, and chose a number of really nice wines for us. We had delicious escargot and I had a good burger.  John had short ribs, and they were great.</p>

<p>I gave Helen a call, and I was pretty sure that, over the noise in the bar, she said that she and Steven couldn't make it.  I was happy to hear that I had misunderstood, and they showed up a bit later and stuck around for a few glasses of wine and dinner.  I just left there a few minutes ago, so for all I know they're still hanging out with John!</p>

<p>It's nice to spend some hanging-out time with friends, and I think Gloria and I should figure out how to do that just a little bit more often.  We do alright, but I bet we could do it a bit more.  There's always a little more time for friends, right?</p>

<p>For the rest of the night, though, I'm just hoping I can manage to be awake when we get to Bethlehem.  Tomorrow is the ABE game, and we've got plenty to do this weekend. </p>
