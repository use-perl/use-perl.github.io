<p>The following is a dramatization.  The content has been changed to ridicule the annoying.<br/><br/>Tuesday morning:<br/><br/>	Dear Gandi:<br/><br/>	I filed a request to have my nameservers changed on Thursday.  It's Tuesday, 	and they still haven't been updated!  This is very inconvenient.<br/><br/>Tuesday evening:<br/><br/>	Dear Ricardo,<br/><br/>	Actualluy, the site is online. 	After this kind of change, you need to wait for the propagation delay. 	This delay can last 48-72 hours.  <br/><br/>Wednesday morning:<br/><br/>	Dear Gandi:<br/><br/>	It's been well over 72 hours, now.  I don't know what you mean, but the DNS 	servers should be:<br/><br/>	x.ns.manxome.org - 66.92.232.24 	y.ns.manxome.org - 67.18.176.115<br/><br/>Thursday morning:<br/><br/>	Dear Ricardo:<br/><br/>	Actually, the servers for manxome.org are : 	Name Server:A.NS.MANXOME.ORG 	Name Server:B.NS.MANXOME.ORG  <br/><br/>Thursday afternoon:<br/><br/>	Dear Gandi:<br/><br/>	Fine.  The problem is that the IPs are wrong.  Your system has the correct 	ones.  The TLD servers has the wrong ones.<br/><br/>Thursday afternoon, later:<br/><br/>	Dear Ricardo:<br/><br/>	You have to update the IP on the registry. 	Please go to our administration page / Others Functions / Nameservers records 	at Registry 	And update your reccords. <br/><br/>...so, to update my records, I need to update /their/ records of my NS servers and IP, and I need to update /the TLD/ records of my NS servers and IP.  This is new.  It is stupid.  It is not documented.  It took way to long to be explained.<br/><br/>So, goodbye Gandi!  I registered at PairNIC this morning, and hope to be transferred quickly.  For reasonable (or better!) service, plus a friend at the company, six dollars more each year is a bargain. </p>

this really is how it works.  Registrars do maintain their own database of nameservers for sanity's sake, and they are a royal pain to change.  When I have to change a nameserver's IP, I just create a new nameserver at the registrar and delete the old one once the transition is made.  That way, no existing records have to be updated, and I don't have to interact with any people.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

So I found on pairnic!  I am<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/quite/ certain, though, that I did not need to do this in the past (admittedly, a year or more ago) when dealing with my records at Gandi.  Perhaps their software was once more intelligent, and had to be altered for some reason.<br> <br>The key difference is that with Gandi, getting the information I needed was a serious pain.  Pair had it quite easily available in their FAQ, where I found it after a few minutes of looking.  There were no days of mental anguish.<br> <br>And, I see, now, that dig finds the correct DNS information.  I will proceed to ignore my DNS for another four years.
