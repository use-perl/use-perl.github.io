<p><html><p><a href="http://jott.com">Jott</a> is a really neat service that lets you Do Stuff via
your cell phone.  The default Stuff you can do is &#34;send email and SMS&#34; and
&#34;setup a reminder.&#34;  There&#39;s also a very <a href="http://jott.com/jotters/index.php/developers">simple
API</a> for writing your own
applications (called Jott Links).  It works something like this:</p><ol><li>you call the toll-free Jott number</li><li>you speak the name of the Jott Link you&#39;ve set up</li><li>you speak a message</li><li>Jott issues a web request with data including your id and the message</li><li>the service does something and replies to Jott</li><li>Jott sends you a reply</li></ol><p>There are Jott Links for Twitter and other things that I don&#39;t care about.
There isn&#39;t one for Hiveminder.  Zak Greant made a <a href="http://jott.com/jotters/index.php/developers">video demonstrating
Hiveminder and Jott together</a>,
which has Jott send mail to the task-by-email interface of Hiveminder.  This
isn&#39;t bad at all, but it puts all kinds of crap into your task, because Jott
sends pretty chatty email.</p><p>I wrote a Jott Link service in about ten minutes (much of which was test time,
waiting for Jott to transcribe my messages).  It uses CGI.pm and
Net::Hiveminder to create a very concise task.  I need to add more features to
it, but I&#39;m in no rush.  I am secretly hoping that the guys at Best Practical
will write a much better version, complete with a user setup link, so that
everyone can use their link, rather than running his own, each on a different
server.</p><p>Here&#39;s my code:</p><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
BEGIN { $ENV{HOME} = '/home/rjbs' }
use CGI qw(:standard);
use Net::Hiveminder;

my ($pw, $key) = `cat /home/rjbs/.hiveminder`;
chomp($pw, $key);

my $hm = Net::Hiveminder->new(
  email    => 'user@example.com',
  password => $pw,
);

my $user_key = url_param('userKey');
my $message  = url_param('message');

die unless lc $user_key eq lc $key;
$hm->create_task("$message\n via Jott.com");

print "Content-type: text/plain\n\nCreated.";
</pre><p>Obviously, this is a horrible hack.  Still, it means I can open my phone, hold
down 5, and dictate todo items right into Hiveminder.</p><p>There are a lot of little problems with Jott, some of which strike me as
significant usability issues, but they&#39;re all very fixable, and I look forward
to seeing them fixed.  I&#39;ll write more about them later.  Here&#39;s the one that
irked me the most last night:  Jott says that to write a Jott Link, you should
expect an HTTP POST.  You do, in fact, get a POST, but all of the data is in
the URL query string, not in the content of the request.  Huh?</p><p>Well, whatever.  All their problems are fixable, and the service looks like it
will be great.</p></html>

<h2>but what about the Terms of Service?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/markjugg/">markjugg</a> on 2008-03-07T03:17:31</h3>
Thanks for the write up, rjbs. I use Hiveminder some, and was considering using Jott, so your connector would be useful.<br><br>However, I was put off by their <a href="http://mark.stosberg.com/cgi-bin/mls.cgi/item_view_comments?item_id=1044&amp;category_id=234" title="stosberg.com">completely open-ended terms of service</a stosberg.com> that allow them to re-write the terms of service at any time in any way without notifying me.



<h2>Simpler path...</h2>

When trying to find this very post actually I came across what seems to be a simpler solution for Hiveminder and Jott.<br><br><a href="http://zak.greant.com/dictate-tasks-into-hiveminder-using-jott/" title="greant.com">http://zak.greant.com/dictate-tasks-into-hiveminder-using-jott/</a greant.com><br><br>-Chris

Right.  I refer to that post *in* my post, even though I linked to the wrong page.  I found that using the send-to-hiveminder produced tasks that were full of too much noise, because of the contents included in the default Jott emails.

And so you do<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I had totally missed that. *sigh* My Apologies.

<h2>Hiveminder has Jott now</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sartak/">sartak</a> on 2008-07-07T17:58:15</h3>
<p>Since people are still finding this post and asking me why Hiveminder still doesn't have Jott support..<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p><p>Hiveminder has had Jott support since a little while after this was originally posted. But Jott (as of this writing) still hasn't given us an official link.</p><p> <a href="http://hiveminder.com/prefs/jott" title="hiveminder.com">You can set up Jott right now</a hiveminder.com>, but until we get an official Jott link, it's a bit more tedious than I'd like.</p><p>Shawn<br>
