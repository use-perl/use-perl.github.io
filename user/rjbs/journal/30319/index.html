<p><p>Gloria gave me a lift to work today, which was really pretty awesome of her.  I got to work about two hours before I would have, taking the ten o'clock bus. What's more, when I got home, she gave me a copy of Tetris DS.  It's a pretty great Tetris.  It's full of crazy Nintendo references, has a bunch of good play modes, and is generally pretty cool.  I mean, it's a Nintendo-branded Tetris on a portable Nintendo system.  Duh!</p>

<p>It's my first Internet-enabled DS game, and I've played a few games online now, both against friends and against randomly chosen opponants.  It was cool to be able to just tap a few buttons and play against other humans (although I had to drop my Airport out of g-only mode), but as vh commented on #perl, it's pretty impersonal.  There's no lobby, no chat, no anything but gameplay.  If every game had access to Pictochat and a lobby, it would be a huge improvement.  It would be great to stop between games and say "gg" and "new mode?" and things like that.</p>

<p>The "friend codes" are pretty lame compared to real handles, too.  I'm not sure whether they're per game or per identity yet, but I think they'll be per-game.</p>

<p>I really wish that Nintendo had put together a better showing for their online service; from what I've seen of Wii's online service, it will be more like the DS service than like Live.  What a bummer!  Live is pretty fantastic. </p>
