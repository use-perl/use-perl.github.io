<p>I am getting freaking /sick/ of O'Reilly!<br/><br/>Several times a week, I get a new book announcement.  Sometimes it's several times in a day.  I like to get announcements of new books, because I assume that sometimes it will be about something that interests me.  I think the last two months' announcements have all been crap, though.  They've all been "Foo Hacks" and "Head-First Foo" and "Foo Annoyances" and "Foo Developer's Notebook" and now, worst of all, "Foo Fan Book."  The saddist part about this is that Foo seems to always bee "iSomething" or "JSomething" or "Something Not Computer Related."<br/><br/>I keep expecting "Lawnmower Hacks" or "Betamax Fan Book" or "Padlock Annoyances."  In fact, looking over the next few months' schedule, I see exactly one book in which I'm somewhat interested: the third edition of the make(1) book.<br/><br/>Maybe it's time to start buying more Manning and AW books. </p>

<p>Hey, what was wrong with Gaming Hacks?</p>

(...and I still like O'Reilly.  I only hit because I love.)<br> <br>To be perfectly honest (and since to claim otherwise would be ludicrous) I have not reviewed all the books about which I'm complaining.  Gaming Hacks looks uninteresting, except for one or two things.  That's my gripe with the whole Hacks series: it looks to me like they're mostly well fleshed-out FAQs, and like any FAQ, it's 95% things I already know.  I'd like them more if I could just Safari them with a shortened minimum period.  (You know, being able to spend a token to make a chapter of a Safari book permanently available in Safari would be great.  I don't think it works that way, though.)<br> <br>Mind Hacks also looks like it might be keen, but I haven't taken the time to look through it yet.<br> <br>Of course, part of the problem is that so many of the books that I<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/would/ buy already<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/have/ been published (by O'Reilly), and I'm not super eager for new editions of everything.  (Oh, and for the sake of saying one more nice thing, I<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/am/ eager to pick up SQL Nut 2, since SQL Nut 1 has been one of the most useful reference books I've got.)
