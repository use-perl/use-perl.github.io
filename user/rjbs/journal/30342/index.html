<p><p>Oh, Nokia 6620, I hardly knew ye!</p>

<p>Yesterday, I caught the 10:05 bus.  Once aboard, I started to do some work and decided I wanted to update my SVK mirror.  I got out my Nokia 6620, used it to connct to the Internet, and updated my checkout.  I also got on IRC, checked my mail, and did some of the other mundane things that my phone made trivial. About three quarters of the way through the ride, I disconnected.</p>

<p>When I got off the bus, I realized I didn't have my phone -- but fortunately I was just in the bus's stairwell, and I got back in and went to my seat.  My phone wasn't there.  I checked my bag, and it wasn't there.  I got down on my hands and knees and looked up and down every aisle.  I checked my pockets and bag again.  I could not find my phone.</p>

<p>I asked the driver whether he had a cell phone, because I could use it to call my phone to listen for the ring.  He said he didn't.  Once I got to the office, I called my phone a few times and sent it some text messages.  No reply was forthcoming.</p>

<p>Finally, around eight o'clock last night, I called T-Mobile and reported my phone stolen.  I am really, really not looking forward to finding a replacement.  It will either be an annoying expense or will involve getting a new contract.  I might just look for an identical model, on eBay, but then I may be back to my previous "ancient firmware" dilemma.</p>

<p>Just now, writing this, I realized the worst part:  I've lost my saved game of Frozen Bubble.  I'm going to need to work my way back up to level seventy. </p>

Umm, isn't the main selling point of SVK that you can maintain your repository offline, <i>without</i> having to risk losing your cellphone on the bus?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
