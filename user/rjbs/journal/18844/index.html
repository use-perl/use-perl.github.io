<p>So, I complained that Bryar isn't making my life full of roses and cherries. A large part of that is my own fault, I will admit. The problem, in summary, is something like, "Bryar takes care of all the hard stuff, but now I need to write all the easy stuff!" I had written a DataSource and Document class, but they were pretty hacky. So, my blogging experience has been meh. Also, I've been using WikiFormat, but only sort of. I really want Mint, but I didn't want to wait or to implement it myself, so WikiFormat was a reasonable alternative. It was just annoying, in a few ways, and didn't map everything I wanted.<br/><br/>I wanted to write a datasource multiplexer, but this was going to be made easier by the refactoring of Bryar's internals to pass configurations around instead of full Bryar objects. I wrote a patch, which was fired into the void. I didn't want to code against the idea that the changes would be accepted as written, so I didn't want to write the multiplexer. This gave me a reason to do nothing /and/ blame someone else for it, which is an obnoxiously easy-to-take option.<br/><br/>So, in some ways Simon's new "I'm gonna write a giant new MT-killer" eliminates that excuse, since as far as I can tell it implies "Bryar is abandoned!" Rather than wait for some massive next-generation more-than-I-need software, I'm pressing ahead with better replacement parts for Bryar.<br/><br/>I rewrote my DataSource, which was simple but time consuming, largely because I wasn't sure, when I started, what I wanted it to do. Then I converted my old journal entries, which let me put to use my newfound (primitive) understanding of awk. I also made it more specific than it needs to be, but I'll fix that soon enough, when I finally make it multiplex and render the way I want.<br/><br/>I also co-opted Simon's "blog" script, tying it to some of my source's silliness via a Vim script. This will be my first entry written using it, but not the first to get posted to use.perl.org via it, as it can't do that yet. Soon enough!<br/><br/>I'm feeling semi-optimistic.</p>
