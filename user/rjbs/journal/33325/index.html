<p><html><p>Even hardware has heisenbugs!</p><p>My LCD was not working: it would just go to sleep when connected to my MacBook. Gloria&#39;s iBook would use it (albiet over VGA, not DVI) and I could use machines at work, both analog-over-DVI and digital-over-DVI. I brought home alternate cables, and it still failed.</p><p>The other problem is that I&#39;ve been unable to get s-video or composite video out of my MacBook.</p><p>With these problems, I spoke to warranty service on the LCD and the laptop, and both were going to be happy to take care of it.</p><p>When I got home, I tried a bunch more cable configurations, and nothing. I tried cycling its power, and nothing. I unplugged it from the AC power for a few seconds, and no-- wait! It worked. What??</p><p>In the process, too, I found that now I&#39;m getting s-video out of the MacBook again.</p><p>Tomorrow, I get to call both AmEx and HP and tell them that they can probably forget about any required service. While I&#39;m very glad that things are working again... it might have been nice to have nice new units! Oh well, there&#39;s quite a while left on the warranties.</p></html>
