<p><p>If my wiki's ReadingQueue page is to be trusted -- although it seems broken rght now -- I have't read any books in months.  What's going on?  If I count comic books, I've read two.  That's hardly a big improvement over nothing, I think.</p>

<p>Fortunately, my birthday is quickly approaching, and I've already got a few things lined up.  Today, Gloria gave me "Call to Conversion," which I've wanted to read for some time now.  Yesterday, I went to the Moravian Book Store to use my birthday discount.  Jayne seemed surprised that I only got one book, but I was honest:  I have too much crap piled up, right now, to add a lot more to the pile.  I just felt like it would be a shame to let the discount go to waste.</p>

<p>I picked up Welcome to the Monkey House.  I read all, or at least most, of it years ago, but I really wanted to re-read it, and it seemed like a good book to have on hand.  I'm about a hundred pages into it, and it's better than I remembered.  Vonnegut is definitely among my favorite writers; he's sincerely sour an sincerely sweet, often at the same time.  I wonder whether he is tired of being compared to Mark Twain.</p>

<p>I also recently picked up Perl Debugged, which I've wanted for a while, now.  I have a small pile of other technical books I want to read, too, sitting in my office.  I think that what I really need to do, to get through that pile, is to take the advice from my favorite fortune cookie:  simplify your life with recurring patterns.  I need to figure out when I want to read, and then follow through with that plan. </p>
