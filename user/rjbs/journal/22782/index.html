<p>We finally watched City of God, today.  It had been sitting on our floor for a week or so, so it will be good to get it back to Netflix.  When I first heard about this movie, I thought, "How could they possibly make a /movie/ of the City of God?"  I'd assumed it was St. Augustine's work.<br/><br/>It's actually a movie about life in the worst slums of Rio.  (I learned this well before seeing it, of course.)  It was very bleak and violent, but it was a very god movie.<br/><br/>Before the movie, though, we headed over to the local Chevy dealership to have our front left blinker replaced.  New bulb, two bucks.  Installation, forty. Sweet!  Anyway, the right way to view this is that $43 is a fine price to pay for not getting killed by a truck that didn't know we were turning.  I'm OK with that.<br/><br/>While waiting, I did some more reading in Fletch, which Marcelo gave me for Christmas.  It blows my mind that they made such a lousy movie of this good book.  Who cast Chevy Chase?  He was a horrible choice; not only is he not a very funny or interesting actor, but he was wrong for this part.  Ugh!  I finished the book after the movie.<br/><br/>While finishing the book (and watching the movie) I got my new iPod synced up. It's the replacement for the last one that died.  It's so shiny, and the LCD contrast is so nice!  I know it will slowly fade, but the iSkin will at least help keep it from scratching.<br/><br/>On the work front, I learned that CGI::Uploader isn't available as a PPM, and there were no passing Win32 test results.  I'll look at it more tomorrow.  At least CGI::Upload seems to be tested.  I'll be tying it to a +/- form, to see if I can to an arbitrary number of attachments to a form submittion.  That should be cool. </p>

<h2>more Fletch</h2>

McDonald has written about half a dozen (or 7, or 8?) books about Fletch, and 3 about Flynn who is a co-star in one of the Fletch books "Confess, Fletch".  They all have the same level of humour and competant mystery.  You might have trouble finding them, though, I haven't seen them very often in bookstores in the last few years.<p>
I kept intending to see the movie and never got around to it.</p>

I hadn't known Fletch was a book until it was given to me.  A few days later, at my local book shop, I saw a whole mess of Fletch books on the mystery shelf.  I'm not sure if I'll run out and buy them yet.  I think I'll want to space them out.  I'm glad to hear they're all good!

I can't believe you think Chase sucks as Fletch.  He's perfect.<br> <br>OK, not like the books, but<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... he makes his own version of the character, and it is perfect.  One of my favorite all-time comedies from the era.  Fletch Lives is, in some ways, even better.
