<p><html><p>My Xbox 360 came with LEGO Indiana Jones and Kung Fu Panda.   I haven&#39;t tried
Kung Fu Panda, but I finished the story mode of Indiana Jones.  It was pretty
good, although nearly the entire Last Crusade scenario was incredibly annoying.
The LEGO games from Tt have a <em>lot</em> going for them, but they also have a lot of
flaws that just don&#39;t seem to be getting fixed.  They have awful cameras,
terrible jumping predictability, horrible partner AI, and the vehicle chapters
tend to kind of suck.  Despite all that, I&#39;d probably give it a B-.  Like I
said, the LEGO games have a lot going for them.</p><p>I borrowed Assassin&#39;s Creed from Bryan and played through a bit of it.  It&#39;s
pretty cool, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s going to get its hooks into me.  I&#39;ll give
it another hour or so, and then call it &#34;good but not addictive enough.&#34;  I
need to be picky about what games I play, since I don&#39;t have lots of gaming
time to spend.</p><p>I rented Bioshock and Gears of War from Gamefly.  Bioshock is pretty great.
The setting is a lot of fun.  If you aren&#39;t familiar with it, it&#39;s basically an
Ayn-Rand-inspired community that has gone insane and self-destructed.  The
whole thing is very art deco looking, with slogans hung around the place like,
&#34;Altruism is the origin of all degeneracy.&#34;</p><p>The gameplay is also good, ranging between really innovative and frustratingly
familiar.  I supposed I should be ashamed of saying this, but I liked FPS
better when you couldn&#39;t jump.  Well, no, that&#39;s not true.  I get frustrated
when it&#39;s impossible to tell whether a surface is too high to jump or I just
suck at jumping.  Further, if I&#39;m a big tough guy who can run and jump, why
can&#39;t I climb?  I mean, that wall is only four feet high.  Do I <em>really</em> need
to find a way around it?  And why must there be constant footfalls even when
there&#39;s nothing nearby?  &#34;Because it&#39;s spooky&#34; isn&#39;t a good enough reason.</p><p>Anyway, that&#39;s mostly nitpicking.  Since I set the game to Easy (so that I could
defeat one of the nasty Big Daddies) I&#39;ve had little reason to complain.  It&#39;s
really very good.</p><p>I was ready to give up on Gears of War after the first mission or so.  It
looked good and seemed interesting, but I kept getting slaughtered and I had
trouble getting my head around how to play.  Last night I gave it one last
chance and ended up playing for two or three hours.  I really got the hang of
it, and it&#39;s fantastic.  I&#39;ve always liked it when shooters are more tactical
than frantic, and Gears of War is very, very tactics-based.  It throws in some
frenzy, too.  In the last bit I played last night before quitting, I was
engaged in a shooting match with some aliens who had good cover, while also
trying to fend off rushing little bastards who&#39;d swarm me.  I&#39;d stand up to
shoot the &#34;wretches&#34; only to have a &#34;grub&#34; take pot shots at me from behind
cover.</p><p>It&#39;s very rewarding.</p><p>Next up, I&#39;m waiting for Dead Space or Dead Rising.  I played the Dead Rising
demo and it seemed like it might be fun, but I&#39;m not expecting to feel the need
to buy it.  I&#39;ve heard mostly intense praise for Dead Space, so I&#39;m hoping to
get that next.  I also have Bryan&#39;s copy of Mass Effect, and might try to give
that a go this weekend if I haven&#39;t gotten a new game from Gamefly yet.</p></html>

<p>That said, I agree about LEGO games.  Very fun, but flawed in the ways you say.  I have Assassin's Creed sitting here for PS3<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... also borrowed.  Also played a bit.  Also didn't keep playing it.</p><p>What you want is <a href="http://pudge.net/glob/2008/11/burnout-paradise.html" title="pudge.net">Burnout Paradise</a pudge.net>.</p>

<p>Thanks, I'll try Burnout Paradise. I'm not usually big on racing games, but a good gimmick in a racing game counts for a lot with me...  I will report back.</p>

<p>Not that I'll see your report since you won't be on useperl and I am too lazy to check multiple sites.</p>

<p>Hey, that's it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... use.perl.org isn't a Perl community web site, it's just my own private syndication service.</p>

<p>I will try to remember to send you a telegram.</p>
