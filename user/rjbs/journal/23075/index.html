<p>I worked today, mostly from home.  I popped by the office to pick up some fastnachts.  Here in the Lehigh Valley, there's a fair amount of Pennsylvania Dutch influence.  The Pennsylvania Dutch are German-descended, not Dutch, and instead of Carnival or Mardi Gras, we have Faschnacht Day.  Before Ash Wednesday, we eat donuts.  Gloria and I had ours today.  They were good -- nice and plain.<br/><br/>As for work itself, it was alright.  I got some things accomplished.  I finished some additions to our production database, tweaked my latest Querylet handlers, and played with some WSH scripts.  WSH is irritating.  I really, really hope that Monad is as useful and powerful as it looks.  Of course, I'd like it even better if I was out of the Windows world before Monad gets released.<br/><br/>While sitting at the Windows box, I installed the Windows Sword Project application.  I didn't like it.  I need to see if there's a decent system for writing in my bible's margins.<br/><br/>After work we went to the gym; it was my first time there in ages, and it felt good.<br/><br/>Gloria made some awesome vegetarian lasagna, and we finally watched some of the Netflix movies that TiVo had put on hold.  Hard Eight was pretty good, I thought.  It was very deliberate and easy to watch, for me.  I certainly liked it better than Boogie Nights, but not as much as Magnolia.  We also watched Free Enterprise, which seemed to be about nine hours long.  It was awful.  A few of the scenes with William Shatner were amusing, but for the most part it was lousy.  Eric McCormack is a really distracting actor.<br/><br/>Oh, and I also got my account on CPAN::Forum fixed, and made some initial posts about Rubric, Querylet, and CPAN::Mini.<br/><br/>Tomorrow, I think I'll return Prince of Persia 2.  It hasn't really been a lot of fun.  Next up: Mario Tennis! </p>
