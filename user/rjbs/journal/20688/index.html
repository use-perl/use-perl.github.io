<p>My PowerBook, AirPort, and iPod are working fine.  Gloria's iBook and iPod mini are fine, too.  So are our iSights.  We have spent thousands on Apple hardware and hundreds on software.  We are loyal customers.  Why does Apple want to alienate us?<br/><br/>Sunday, I went to the Apple Store in King of Prussia.  "What ho, Apple Store!" I say, "think you could fix my wireless mouse for me?"<br/><br/>They reply, "There's a one year warranty on that.  Just call Apple Care!"<br/><br/>This is a fine response.  I fork over $200 for an AirPort and go home.<br/><br/>On Tuesday, I call Apple Care and say, "Hello, old chums!  I've got a rummy problem with my mouse; think you could tend to it?"<br/><br/>I get transferred to Deepest India, and repeat my question.<br/><br/>"What kind of computer are you using?"  I tell him I'm using my PowerBook.<br/><br/>"What's the serial number?"<br/><br/>"Of the mouse?"<br/><br/>"No, of the computer."  Immediately, I begin to wonder where this is going, but I answer.<br/><br/>"That computer is out of warranty, sir."<br/><br/>"Sure is!  The mouse, though, is not.  I bought it in March."<br/><br/>"Oh.  Can I have the serial number of the mouse?"<br/><br/>I ask him where to find it, and he doesn't know.  I read him the long number from the inside of the battery well, but it doesn't resolve in his system.  He asks if I have the box, and I reply that I threw it out months ago.  Finally, he has some advice:<br/><br/>"I think you better take that to the Apple Store."<br/><br/>Needless to say, I am not amused.  I explain that it's far away, and I was already there.  He directs me to my friendly local retailer.  They, when called, groan about Apple's usual asininity, but say that I can bring it in and have it taken care of there, free of charge.  Huzzah!  If they pull it off, they get my business forever.<br/><br/>...but first, one last chance for Apple.  The wireless mouse was introduced less than a year ago.  I will attempt to confront them with this information, as evidence that my mouse is within its warranty.  If they still refuse... I just don't know. </p>

<h2>Not just Apple my friend</h2>

<p>I have a Dell. I had a problem. I called Dell and get a rep in India. I send an email and I get an answer that contains "things to try". I do, they don't work, I send an email. I get an email from another rep because the first rep is off now (time zone difference you see). I go through the whole thing again. Three different times. Finally I get pissed and they come up with the solution. A swap of hardware. They say it will be two days. Cool. Two days later I take a day off to be home for "the swap". It was two days INDIA time. They came the next day when I wasn't home. Finally it got settled.</p>

<p>I have worked with Apple care. And it was not that painful in comparison.</p>



<h2>Can't do the math</h2>

<p>They are probably institutionally incapable of making that leap of logic, but if you speak to an individual said individual can probably handle it.  I had the same problem several years ago on a Blue and White desktop G3 with a mail-in offer for an internal Zip drive.  They declined my offer since the date was not on the receipt I sent them.  I called them up, explained when it had been purchased, and they got my drive right out to me.  Can't remember the specifics, but there was some clear and obvious evidence they could have had to show them the computer was purchased during the rebate period.</p>



<h2>Remember these magic words.</h2>

I had some trouble getting my Applecare registration recognized.  I'd bought it about nine months in but didn't realize I had to register it (that's the problem with handing a customer a box) until I had a problem well after my normal warranty was up.<br> <br>1st call:  Fax us your receipts and we'll have you registered within 72 hours.<br>2nd call:  You were told 72 hours?  Oh dear.<br>3rd call:  Warranty department's got the stuff, waiting on them.<br>4th call:  Are you sure you faxed us your receipts?<br> <br>Is is at this point that I said the magic words:<br>"I would like to speak to your manager, please."<br>Lo!  All was (eventually) fixed and my stomach lining was saved.  Just make sure that you get the manager's name and a direct number.<br> <br>Other handy Applecare tips:<br> <br>The Apple Store can do some repairs on site, but if they can't and you have to ship your machine off to Apple find a certified Apple retailer that has been in business for a long time and send all your warranty repair work through them.  They will have years of experience working around Apple's new found stupidity and the appropriate level of jilted bitterness to take advantage of it.  Many of these folks used to do brisk business in repair until Apple took away their business.  They also might offer an inexpensive backup service since Apple is no longer guaranteeing that they might not wave a bar magnet across your hard drive in the course of repair.  Tekserv in NYC, CMU Repair Store in Pittsburgh and Mac Force in Portland are three I can personally recommend.<br> <br>Always buy Applecare on laptops.  Apple laptops are a pain in the ass to crack open and nearly impossible to get parts for (Apple won't sell them in the US or let them be resold).  pbparts.com is about your only hope but note that an LCD for an iBook is $450!  New logic board $750!  I've had my iBook fail on me three times in a little less than two years (three logic board failures plus a cracked power jack).  I have gotten more than my money's worth.<br>
