<p>I was working on my rewrite of jGal while in Florida.  I got all the frameworkstuff done to turn a list of files into an object tree.  Now I've realized thatI've got some big obstacles to turning that object tree back into the kind ofHTML that I want.  I'm hoping that I can just give child objects a link totheir parents, but that will mean that I can't have images appear in more thanone area of the tree.  Maybe I'll look at doing something with caller.  I needto write a quick sketch of how it all works and then ask someone to look at it.I think I'm too close to the problem.<br/><br/>At least it gives me a reason to stop and write some of the missing POD.Unfortunately, in the meantime, I have a crapload of images to put ingalleries, and I still don't have nested directories forming nice galleries.  Ireally don't want to keep doing that by hand.<br/><br/>I looked at some other people's gallery software, but nothing is what I want.Someone on #perl remarked (correctly) that everyone must write his own imagegallery software.  Why can't there also be the good common one that everyoneuses after that?  Everyone writes his own template system, but then there are afew stock ones.  I haven't found a stock gallery system I like, yet.  SpiderEyes looks interesting, though.  I might give it another look.  I just don'treally want to write XML.  Maybe if I use it for a while and like it, I'll findthat it's easy to YAMLize it.  Or maybe some kind soul will point me atsomething else good.<br/><br/></p>
