<p><p>Saturday was Andy's annual wine tasting party, at his eternally in-progress house.  We picked up a French blend that I hadn't tried before and headed over at about 19:30, and found the place pretty packed already.  By the end of the night, his house was positively jam-packed with people -- at least on the first floor.  The second floor never got particularly busy, even though it had plenty of room, some seating, and a nice warm fire.</p>

<p>There was a fire downstairs, too, and both were vital: it was frigid out, and Andy's place has no heat or insulation.  It was up to the booze and the fire to keep us warm.  Both did a good job.  I tried five different reds, and three of them were quite enjoyable.  The bottle we brought was a 2001 Paillet-Quancard from Bordeau, and was a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc.  I expected a nice flavor, but I didn't get much flavor at all.  John said that he's learned over and over that blends don't deliver, and I think I'm willing to just take his word on it, rather than be so let down again.  It wasn't a bad wine, it just wasn't a very good wine.</p>

<p>The three wines I liked were: Marques de Discal 2000, which was a very dry Spanish wine.  I really like a very dry wine, and I think I could've just stuck to that for the rest of the evening; Seven Oaks "J. Lohr" Cabernet Sauvignon 2003; and a Fish Eye Merlot, the vintage of which I don't recall.  Both the Seven Oaks and the Fish Eye were fairly straightforward, but tasty.  I like wine, and maybe I should try to drink more wine -- and less soda!</p>

<p>The last few times that I was in Wales for business, I'd pick up a bottle of Merlot at the Tesco's and have a glass with dinner in my hotel room, some nights.  It worked out alright, even with the mediocre wine I seem to recall getting.</p>

<p>So, the wine was good.  There were hors d'oeuvres, which were also good.  The best part of the evening, though, was probably the other people -- and that's probably as it should be.  Andy and I worked at IQE together, so there were a number of other IQE employees (or ex-employees) there.  I talked with a few of them, individually, and had some good conversation.  It was a little amusing, to me, that I probably conversed more with them at Andy's than I had while we worked together.  C'est la vie!</p>

<p>Among these IQEans was Dmitri, who laughed and shook my hand when I told him that I now have the same job title that he had when I was there: "Research and Development."  We're having business cards printed up, and we had to put something down under our names.  I'd been fairly unsure what I wanted, but John suggested R&amp;D, and I decided it was better than anything I was likely to come up with.  If you see me at either of the big Perl conferences this year, you can try to demand my hot new business card.</p>

<p>I'll be stopping in at IQE this week, and I'm hoping to at least say hello to a few more people whom I haven't seen in some time.  Even a wave is better than nothing; today, crossing the Fahy to the bus, I saw Joe coming out of the plant's rear door and waved across the lot.</p>

<p>Andy's parties are among the very few that I tend to really enjoy.  I'm looking forward to the next one. </p>
