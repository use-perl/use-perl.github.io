<p><html><p>Since the very, very early days of Sub::Exporter, it was clear that it would be
really useful to be able to replace the way that exporting itself occurs.  That
is: the way that routines are generated and installed, based on configuration,
gathered collections, and other user arguments to the generated <code>import</code>
method.</p><p>In the past, it was possible to replace this, but only by relying on an
(intentionally) awful and undocumented interface.  The routine worked something
like this:</p><ol><li>build an arrayref of (thing, import-as) pairs</li><li>call <code>_do_import</code> on each one</li><li><code>_do_import</code> cleans up the pair and some associated configuration</li><li><code>_do_import</code> calls the &#34;exporter&#34;</li><li>the default exporter calls <code>_generate</code> to build the installable routine</li><li>the default exporter calls <code>_install</code> to install the routine</li><li>next pair</li></ol><p>The &#34;exporter&#34; is the thing that was supposed to be pluggable.  In fact,
Sub::Exporter::Util contains an alternate exporter.  The problem was that the
interface stank, and I didn&#39;t want to publish an interface until I had one I
liked... but the possible uses are huge.  I use it in the Sub::Exporter test
suite to test what would have been done, basically letting me instrument the
system.  Dieter and I were talking about making a way to gather information
about what has exported where for a kind of cheap metadata about what roles
have been built where, and how.  (This would be needed as part of my
long-standing mixin factory idea, and as part of the roles stuff Dieter wants
to work on.)</p><p>Finally, spurred on by outside demand (that is, Dieter), I made a first pass at
implementation last night.  I think it&#39;s pretty good!</p><p>Now:</p><ol><li>build an arrayref of (thing, import-as) pairs</li><li>call <code>_do_import</code> on arrayref</li><li><code>_do_import</code> calls the <em>generator</em> for each pair, generating a new arrayref</li><li><code>_do_import</code> the exporter, passing the new arrayref and some other info</li><li>the default exporter installs the routine</li><li>next pair</li></ol><p>Now there are two publicly defined callbacks that can be provided, either for
your whole exporting package (passed as part of the <code>-setup</code> for Sub::Exporter)
or per call to <code>import</code>, as part of the optional initial hashref.</p><p>I&#39;m hoping to see and create some fun new behaviors.</p><p>This code is on the CPAN as <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Sub-Exporter">Sub::Exporter
0.977_01</a>.  It&#39;s a big step toward
1.000.</p></html>
