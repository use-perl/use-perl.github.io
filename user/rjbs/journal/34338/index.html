<p><html><p>I was pretty sure I was going to buy iWork &#39;08 before it was announced.  Every
version of Keynote has had a few improvements that made it worth having, even
though I only produce two or three slideshows a year.  Keynote 4 adds a feature
I&#39;ve often wanted: the ability to make an object on a slide move around.  I&#39;ve
wanted to use this for code samples:  I&#39;d create a text box with code in it,
then put a rectangle on top of it, translucent and one line high, and have that
move from one important line to the next.</p><p>I&#39;ve already tried this, and I think it works pretty well.  I&#39;m a little
disappointed that I can&#39;t have it grow to twice its height while doing this,
but the only action that would come close is scale.  I don&#39;t want to scale the
box, I want to change one dimesion.</p><p>This brings me to the one big issue that I have with Keynote.  Its AppleScript
support, as far as I can tell, really sucks.  Now, this is a big improvement
from Keynote 1.0, in which there was no scriptability.  There still isn&#39;t much.
It focuses mainly on automating the playing of slideshows.  It would be nice to
have a way to alter the contents of the slide.  I can set the &#34;body&#34; property,
but setting up the body text area is sort of annoying and stupid.  Worse, I can
only set the content of the body not, as far as I can tell, its formatting.</p><p>I don&#39;t really want to set any formatting except for the coloring, but I can&#39;t
do that with AppleScript.  I will probably have to resort to generating RTF or
(ugh) PDF (via LaTeX) and then putting it on the slide.</p><p>See, I want to syntax highlight my code samples, at least some of the time, and
probably most of the time.  Doing this by hand is problematic and painful,
especially if I realize, later, that I need to change a small problem on fifty
similar but different slides.</p><p>My current best hope is to marry RTF::Writer and
Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate, which so far looks something like this:</p><pre>my $str = '';
my $hl  = Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate::Perl->new;
my $rtf = RTF::Writer->new_to_string(\$str);

my %color = (
  _default => [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  Keyword  => [ 0, 0, 255 ],
);

my %color_pos;
my @colors;

for (keys %color) {
  my @rgb = @{ $color{ $_ } };

  my $pos = $color_pos{ @rgb };

  unless (defined $pos) {
    push @colors, \@rgb;
    $pos = $color_pos{ @rgb } = $#colors;
  }

  $color_pos{ $_ } = $pos;
}

$rtf->prolog(
  fonts  => [ 'Courier New' ],
  colors => [ sort ],
);

while (my $in = <>) {
  my ($text, $type) = $hl->highlight($in);
  my $pos = $color_pos{ $type } // $color_pos{ _default };

  $rtf->print(
    \"\\cf$pos",
    \'\fs40\b\i',  # 20pt, bold, italic
    $text,
  );
}

$rtf->close;

print $str;
</pre><p>It needs some work, but the big problem I have now is that input that looks
like this:</p><pre>$obj->method
</pre><p>Comes out like this:</p><pre>$obj>method
</pre><p>There&#39;s some kind of escaping of the dash, turning it into a backslashed
underscore.  I&#39;ve sent the Sean Burke an email, but I&#39;ll probably have a look
at the code and spec myself soon.</p><p>Even if I can&#39;t parlay this into a syntax highlighter for Keynote, maybe I&#39;ll
end up with a good syntax highlighting engine that outputs to RTF.  I guess
that might be useful.</p></html>

If you could somehow wrap code in some tags to make it highlight?<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # simple highlighting of Perl code<br><br>Nothing fancy...

Ugh...I thought the tags would should be they didn't:<br><br>[perl]<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # code here<br>[/perl]

Here on use.perl?  Yeah.  It would be pretty easy, I'd think, to implement.  The Kate stuff that I show actually has a method to just convert a whole string into HTML.

Oh!<br><br>What I'd like, there, is the ability to pick a syntax type from a dropdown on the text inspector, and maybe a color scheme.
