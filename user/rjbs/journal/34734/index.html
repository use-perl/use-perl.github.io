<p><html><p>Earlier this week, I read the final of the Fletch books.  (Actually, I read the
final Son of Fletch book.  The distinction isn&#39;t that important.)  I&#39;m looking
forward to reading the Flynn series, which is something of a spin-off.</p><p>There were eleven Fletch and Son of Fletch books, all of which I enjoyed.  Some
of them were better than others, and some were more plausible than others, but
I enjoyed them all.  (The two Son of Fletch books were, I think, the weakest.
They just seemed too over the top.)</p><p>In looking for some information about Fletch, though now I forget what, I found
&#34;the Official Gregory Mcdonald website.&#34;  (Strangely, it seems that his name is
usually written Mcdonald and not McDonald.  I have no idea why.)</p><p>Anyway, the website really bugs me.  It says it&#39;s official, but I&#39;m not sure
what that means.  It&#39;s hard to tell whether it&#39;s actually written by anyone
associated with Mcdonald.  The <a href="http://www.gregorymcdonald.com/mysteries.html">mystery
books</a> page does its best to
turn each of his fairly subtle, character-driven novels into an
overly-simplified morality tale.  From <em>Confess, Fletch</em>, the &#34;inference&#34; drawn
is: &#34;The art market, maintained by the elite, is not better than it should be.&#34;
From <em>Fletch and the Man Who</em>, &#34;Democracy cannot work if the press exploits too
deeply politicians&#39; private lives.&#34;</p><p>I am not sure whether I should be saddened that a fan has so lamely summarized
these books, or saddened that the author thinks of them this way himself.  The
most ludicrous summary is of <em>Son of Fletch</em>, which deals with the
dysfunctional family of a multi-billionaire and their immediate and
unbelievable self-destruction after his death.</p><blockquote><p>Comment: Written during the collapse of (Communist) USSR, this has proven
to be a highly prophetic novel. Inference: When dictatorial authority
collapses, mutual and self-destruction is likely among its previous 
subjects.</p></blockquote><p>While I can buy that this novel, published in &#39;93, was informed by the collapse
of the USSR, it seems silly to take it as allegory or to call it prophetic.</p><p>I&#39;m taking a very small break from novels to catch up on some technical reading
-- I have some books to review -- and then I&#39;ll probably read <em>Flynn</em>.  From
this book about the eccentric detective introduced in <em>Confess, Fletch</em>, I will
be able to infer that &#34;Perception can beat procedure.&#34;  Who could&#39;ve guessed?</p></html>

<h2>Enjoyable</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Lecar_red/">Lecar_red</a> on 2007-10-29T15:36:39</h3>
I would agree that the fletch books are surprisingly enjoyable. I've never read anything else by the McDonald but he seems to be a pretty good storyteller.
