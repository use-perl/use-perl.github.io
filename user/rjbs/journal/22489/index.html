<p>Like I said earlier, I've been playing a lot of Mario Golf this week.  Mostly I was focusing on unlocking the "star characters."  When you get the star version of a character, you can play him with slightly different stats and a wildly improved swing.  Yoshi, for example, went from driving around 205 yards to driving around 250.  Wow!<br/><br/>I was just trying to unlock Star Wario, because Wario is the man.  In an extremely close match, I did so, and promptly headed back into Shifting Sands, the tournament that has routinely kicked my butt and left me throwing my controller.  Although I had to do quite a bit of mulliganing, I beat it handily, finishing an amazing seven strokes below par.  The next best score was par.  Wow!<br/><br/>I'm not sure if I'll want to brave the new course tomorrow.  I might actually try to write some Rubric code.  hide mentioned it in his use.perl journal, and Andy was poking around with it today, and I'm feeling pretty positive about getting some progress made.<br/><br/>For now, though, I'm going to try to sleep soundly through the night. </p>

How did we get from a pair of Italian plumbers fighting turtles and crabs in a sewer by bopping the floor below them with their heads to golf?

You know, I do wonder what the first weird spin-offs were.  Mario Golf has been around for a good while, though.  I'm also a fan of Mario Kart, and Mario Party isn't bad.  I'm not a big fan of Mario Tennis, at least on the N64, and I am not looking forward to Mario Baseball.  I'm hoping to get Mario Clash for the VB sometime, and the Mario RPGs are great.  When do we get Mario "Dating Sim"?
