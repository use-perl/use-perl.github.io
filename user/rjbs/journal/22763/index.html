<p>It wasn't a long weekend, but it really felt like one.  Today it was a little hard to get my mind into my work, but I still got some things done.  I am just completely burned out on this project, and I want it to end.  I want it to be over, and then I don't want to think about it for a few months.  My burnout is making me worthless, which is making me depressed.<br/><br/>On the weekends, I can get things done on my own work, so I know I'm not just burned out in general.  It's the project.  (For example, I uploaded the bible shorthand software I was thinking about, Religion::Bible::Reference.)<br/><br/>I did get work done today, mostly connecting templates to CGI handlers and throwing in liberal use of my baby, CGI::Form::Template.  Now that I have it, I'm surprised something like it isn't used more often.  I don't know for /what/ it would be used, but I like it.<br/><br/>Once work was done, I read the new Astro City collection.  It was damn good, as I expected.  If you like superhero comics, you should read Kurt Busiek's Astro City.  Then it was about time to head out for dinner.<br/><br/>Gloria and I went to Mangos for her birthday dinner.  Getting there was a little troublesome, but we made it.  We were over dressed and didn't need the reservation, but who cares?  It's fun to dress up.  (Except for Gloria, who spent half the day shopping in anticipation of being underdressed.  Still, I got to have a well-dressed woman on my arm, so that worked out.)<br/><br/>We split plantain tostanos (I liked them, Gloria didn't), duck empanadas (we thought they were ok), and paella fritters (they were awesome).  I had a coffee-seasoned rack of lamb and Gloria had roast duck.  Our entrees were fine, but they weren't just what we wanted.  It was hard to decide on something, so we sort of guessed.  We'll have to go back another time and try again, even if only to get more tapas.<br/><br/>For dessert, I had their chewey chocolate tort with hazelnut ice cream.  The tort was a little too hard, for me, but it tasted great.  I am a sucker for hazelnuts, especially in gelato or ice cream.  Gloria had bananas foster, and wasn't blown away.<br/><br/>After that, we headed to my parents' place for second dessert: berry tart.  I'm not a big berry-eater, and stuck mostly to the strawberry and raspberry part of the tart, which I enjoyed.  After a little dallying, we headed home.  We're both tired.  Gloria is working on her exercise routine for tomorrow's class and I am working on this.<br/><br/>...and now that I'm done, I may go read and sleep. </p>
