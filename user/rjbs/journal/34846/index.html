<p><html><p>I&#39;ve been running Leopard for just over a week, and it&#39;s a really mixed bag. My memory is that Tiger and Panther were only annoying because they failed to fix things I wanted fixed.  Leopard has broken quite a bunch of stuff, and I afraid that some of it just isn&#39;t going to get fixed.</p><p>The whole user interface got an overhaul in the form of the new &#34;unified&#34; window style.  I find it nearly totally unobjectionable.  The only places it bugs me are where it breaks apps who relied on metal and now have weird looking custom buttons -- and that&#39;s the fault of the application authors, not of Apple.  The new dock is stupid, but I can turn it off, so that&#39;s fine.</p><p>It&#39;s just all the little things.  Stacks are a great idea, but because they&#39;re just represented by a bunch of superimposed icons, it&#39;s nigh impossible to tell the difference between a stack containing a disk image and a disk image -- and there are many other similar conflicts.  I can&#39;t usefully right-click an icon in an expanded stack.  I can&#39;t put a folder in the dock and have it open normally when clicked.  I can&#39;t get the old popup-menu style navigation for it. Ugh!</p><p>The new Finder sidebar seems swell, except that it is totally insane.  When I eject volumes, sometimes they go away and sometimes they don&#39;t.  Sometimes the icon for an external disk is there, though it&#39;s been ejected.  If I remove it from the sidebar, then the next time I connect that disk, it isn&#39;t there. What?  It&#39;s completely insane, and has at least one led to me yanking the firewire cable of a drive that was neither in my sidebar nor safely ejected.</p><p>The once-useful preview pane for an MP3 file used to show a QuickTime-style progress bar.  Now it just has a giant, ugly music note.  I can click it to play a preview, but I can&#39;t see how far into the track I am, and I can&#39;t seek.</p><p>The new folder icons are wretched.</p><p>I used to really, really need to have working virtual desktops to feel productive.  When I got sick of all the quirks and bugs in the add-on virts for OS X, I learned to do without.  I&#39;m not surprised, but I am sad, to find that I really don&#39;t like Spaces.  If I&#39;m on a workspace with no Terminal windows and I try to open a new one, I&#39;m moved back to Terminal&#39;s home space.  I can&#39;t do anything to label a workspace, like give it a distinct background or floating text, so I&#39;m reduced to hitting F7 or flipping between spaces to see where I am.  It&#39;s just too annoying to use.</p><p>Time Machine is great.  So far, no complaints.</p><p>They still haven&#39;t fixed the bug that won&#39;t let you turn on FileVault if you&#39;re on a case-sensitive filesystem.</p><p>Terminal is a little better in a few ways.  It&#39;s more scriptable, and it lets you say that bold text should be in a brighter color.  The latter enhancement makes up for the fact that I can no longer use the TerminalColors hack.</p><p>The inclusion of a (slighly hidden) Apple Remote Desktop client is a nice bonus.  I upgraded my mother&#39;s Mac Mini to Leopard and already I&#39;ve been able to use the &#34;Screen Sharing&#34; app to fix problem several times.  Sure, there was Chicken of the VNC before, but Apple&#39;s app has a few really nice features.  The ability to scale the remote display to fit the local screen is so useful that it makes me wonder why every remote desktop system hasn&#39;t had this since long ago.</p><p>I&#39;m looking forward to someone running a free CalDAV server so I can take advantage of the improvements in iCal.  So far, it just looks uglier to me.</p><p>Despite the one totally random Google hit suggesting the opposite, my piece of crap Samsung phone (may it die in a fire) still doesn&#39;t iSync with Leopard.  I am not surprised.</p><p>The whole system seems snappier, too, which is probably the best thing about the upgrade.  If the obnoxious Finder sidebar behavior gets fixed, I may be able to forgive almost everything else.</p><p>I also sure wouldn&#39;t mind some Leopard-compatible releases of things that I&#39;m currently doing without, like WindowShade X.  Heck, I wouldn&#39;t mind a less twitchy version of my EVDO modem&#39;s software (it works, under Leopard, but issues a bunch of stupid warning messages when inserted), and I&#39;m starting to think that I&#39;ll want a Leopard version of CandyBar, or some other icon replacement tool, to get rid of these horrible new folder icons.</p><p>Here&#39;s hoping that 10.5.1 comes soon and fixes things. </p></html>

Agreed, there are some annoyances with 10.5: stacks are particularly irksome, and Spaces has a few rough edges that need filing.<br><br>Regarding the mp3 preview stuff: that should be taken care of by Quick Look. You don't have to be in icon view to get a preview, just hit *space* whenever you see an mp3 (or anything really).<br><br>Paul

This is not a suitable substitute.  When an MP3 is playing from the Preview pane, I can give focus to another application and it continues.  When an MP3 is playing in Quick View, this is not true.<br><br>Further, one Finder window can be playing the MP3 preview while I navigate in another.  In Quick View, the QV always relates to the focused Finder window.

I don't care about the icons.<br><br>I am not going to bother with Time Machine any time soon.  SuperDuper works well enough.<br><br>I have dumped iTerm in favor of Terminal.  Less scriptable, but good enough.  Much more stable than iTerm, faster, better-looking, and now has TABS.<br><br>I never use iCal, except I have a cron job that once a night just launches it, then quits it.  It syncs with Google calendar during that time, so I can sync it (and have a backup copy of my calendars).<br><br>Worst problem so far, other than random problems with screen saver crashing, Parental Controls resetting, Spaces puking<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... it broke all of my audio drivers, and NO ONE has them fixed yet.  Line6 has a beta.  MOTU has nada.
