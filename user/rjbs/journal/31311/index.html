<p><p>The new house is three stories, and gets lots of natural light.  Sadly, none of
its third story windows is well-placed for stargazing.  If one was, I'd have
more time to look through my telescope and more inspiration to write silly
astronomy code.  Maybe when we overhaul the third floor, we'll put in a window
on the slant of the roof.  Probably not.</p>

<p>Since I don't do much stargazing, my last need for astronomical Perl code came
while working on the RPG that I run.  It's space-based, and I wanted to get an
idea of distance between various star systems.  There were a number of Astro
modules on the CPAN, but most of them either lacked the few features I needed
or required third party libraries that didn't just work out of the box.</p>

<p>Since I didn't need much at all, I just broke out my copy of Practical
Astronomy For Your Personal Computer (a fantastic book that I've never
regretted buying), and wrote this silly little program.  It would be a lot more
fun if there was a giant and easy to access database of stars.  I think I'll
need to dig more for that.</p>

<h2>Database of stars</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2006-10-13T12:19:42</h3>
<p>Are you thinking about something like the New General Catalogue (NGC)? Or one of the specialised <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_catalogue" title="wikipedia.org">star catalogues</a wikipedia.org>?</p>

<p>PS.: <tt>&lt;ecode&gt;</tt> tags automatically escape their content, so if you escape it as well it comes out with gibberish.</p>

The NGC or any full-sky catalog would be swell.<br><br>As for ecode, I really thought I'd fixed my posting script... hmph!

<p>Something like <a href="http://www.seds.org/user/spider/ngc/ngc.html" title="seds.org">The Interactive NGC Catalog Online</a seds.org>?</p>

Beyond the fact that the form doesn't seem to work properly in Firefox, this lacks information like "distance," and doesn't seem to have any system for better machine queries.<br><br>The HYG database looks potentially like just what I wanted.  Now, to make an interface...

<h2>First Perl program!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ChrisDolan/">ChrisDolan</a> on 2006-10-13T15:55:10</h3>
It's interesting you bring this up.  Here's a link to my very FIRST Perl program ever:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/user/dolan/gurps/galdist.cgi" title="wisc.edu">http://www.astro.wisc.edu/user/dolan/gurps/galdist.cgi</a wisc.edu><br><br>It computes actual and perceived travel times for relativistic journeys between nearby star systems.  I wrote it for a (short-lived) sci-fi RPG campaign back in 1999.  All of the players in the game were astronomy PhD students, like me, so I had to get the math right.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br>



<h2>check the HYG database</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dwhite21787/">dwhite21787</a> on 2006-10-14T21:16:55</h3>
<a href="http://astronexus.com/node/34" title="astronexus.com">http://astronexus.com/node/34</a astronexus.com><br><br>HYG to 7.5: Database containing all stars brighter than magnitude +7.5, or closer than 50 parsecs. This is the same as the "Version 1.0" database that has been on this site before. (31858 stars)
