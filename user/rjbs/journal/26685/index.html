<p>We went out to dinner with my parents tonight.  We went to Nawab, the local Indian place.  They had coupons for two-for-one entrees, which said, "Cannot be combined with other coupons.  One coupon per person per visit."  The waitress would only take one coupon, though, saying that the "cannot be combined" meant that only one coupone could be used for the entire party of four.  This totally blew.  My mom was treating, so she got stuck for an extra twelve bucks or so.<br/><br/>The food was really good, at least. </p>

What else could it mean that it cannot be combined with other coupons?  Were you interpreting "other" as meaning "other category" as opposed to "any other coupon"?  I don't think you were shafted at all.

<p>I'm with Ric on this one.  It also says &ldquo;1 coupon per person per visit&rdquo;, not <em>per party</em> &mdash; which clearly means if you have <em>n</em> people then you're allowed to use <em>n</em> coupons.</p>

<p>I reckon that would be using multiple instances of a <em>single</em> coupon, so no &ldquo;other&rdquo; coupons would be involved.</p>

<p>Otherwise you'd be better off turning up as 4 individuals rather than as a party of 4, and that's just silly&nbsp;...</p>

Right: if they say "one coupon <i>per person</i> per visit" then I assume they mean that the number of people is relevant, so "other coupon" means "coupon for a different discount."

Ah, I see.<br><br>Still, I suspect that what we have here is a case of non-native English, rather than any intent to screw you.  Using "party" requires a fairly good knowledge of English grammar.  One per person doesn't even make sense in the context of a coupon based around getting two entrees, unless they expect a large number of highly gluttonous customers<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
