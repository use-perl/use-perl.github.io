<p><p>My MacBook came with iWork, and thus Keynote, installed on it.  It was a demo version, so when I bought the full version, I just downloaded a serial number. (I wouldn't have minded getting a copy of the manuals, but the help has been good enough, so far.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I was looking at the online help for Keynote the other day, and I saw a update available.  It was Keynote 3.0.1v2 Updater.  Huh?  Is that going to update me to 3.0.1v2?  Is that a clever way of saying 3.0.1.2?  I downloaded it, and it installed, so I figured it was an update I should've run.  After I'd run it, however, I tried running it again and it ran.  There was no, "You already have this version" warning, which makes me wonder whether I was running that version before.  Both before and after that update, the About Keynote menu showed 3.0.1.</p>

<p>My current theory is that this update was their second version of the updater. I don't know, though.  I wish I did.</p>

<p>Here's some bonus mumbling:  Dear Lazyweb, is there a way to get a free text block on a master slide?  I mean, I know I can put one on the master that has fixed text, but I want to be able to create a style free text box that's stuck at a guideline.  That way when it expands, it will stay there.</p>

<p>It seems like all I can create, instead, is "body text."  In other words, a bulleted list.  I can remove the bullets, but it won't expand as I type.  I don't want to have to resize the body manually, especially because it will lose its centering.</p>

<p>I guess I will go troll the forums once I'm back on the ground. </p>
