<p>At Pobox, I met this guy Thomas Thurman.  One day Dieter gave me a link to a funny little page on his site, where I saw a Gnusto link in his sidebar. Gnusto is a few things.  First and foremost, it's a spell in the Zork universe; it makes things glow.  Beyond that, it's a Mozilla extension that lets you play Infocom (Z-Machine) games in your browser.  I never really used Gnusto; I'd tried the first few releases, which were very, very experimental, and went back to Frotz.  Still, it was neat.<br/><br/>Well, it turned out that Thomas wrote Gnusto, which struck me as a pretty neat coincidence.  (There aren't really that many IF enthusiasts left, after all.) We talked a little bit about IF, and it got me thinking that I should really go back and work on my old aborted games.  On the way to Toronto, I played one I hadn't played (LASH), and I've played a few more little ones since then. Yesterday, on the (extremely long) bus ride home, I played some more, including the too-cool "shrapnel."  I also also happy to see a new game from Chris Klimas, who wrote one of my all-time favorites, Mercy.<br/><br/>So, I started to poke around in my ~/code/inform directory, looking at the projects I had let fester.  A few of them seem worth finishing, to me, but I just can't get it together.  Whenever I've tried to write anything in the last few years, I feel like I have a lot of good ideas for scenes or plots, but  I can't deliver.  If I know the beginning, I can't figure out the middle or the end.  If I know the whole plot, I get bogged down on the details -- scenes or implementation.<br/><br/>I think I need to work on writing IF vignettes or very short stories; something like Speed IF, maybe, but not silly.  Maybe I should find some writing exercises and interactify them... </p>
