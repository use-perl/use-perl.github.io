<div class="span8">
<p><p>I did some overhauling to a module a few months ago.  I added a new interface
to it, and left the old one in with a deprecation warning.  After a little
while, the original author uploaded a new release that totally removed the old
interface.  Within a day or two I'd received comments on IRC and via email.
They were all something like, "The new interface is definitely better, but I
had code using the old one!"</p>

<p>This kind of angry email is a great compliment.  It tells you that your code is
valued enough that someone relies on it and would like to keep using it -- as
long as you don't break your promises anymore.  Your public API, after all, is
a promise.  You can cross your fingers when you make it, by putting in a big
<strong>THIS MIGHT CHANGE</strong> warning, but as likely as not people will rely on it
anyway, if it's good.  If you don't even provide that warning, people will
assume that things will be backwards compatible forever.  The CPAN (which has
spoiled me for doing serious work in other languages that I like more than
Perl) helps enforce this promise in a few ways.  For one, more people have easy
access to your code, and to code that requires your code.  For another, even if
you go from "v1" to "v2" -- which largely identifies when APIs can break --
there is no way to indicate that in your distribution metadata.  Some of the
mod_perl team pushed for this when Apache::Request (and more) modules were
going to come out for Apache 2.  Apache::Request 1.x and 2.x weren't going to
be interchangeable, but they had the same name.  The request to add metadata to
do this was denied, so they had to move to a new namespace.</p>

<p>The <code>only</code> module does a bit to mitigate this problem, but it ends up with the
same issues as Firefox's extension compatibility metadata.  Authors are
encouraged to give a maximum compatible version, and their code then breaks for
no reason other than that arbitrary metadata.  (I am under the impression that
the 1.5.0.x versioning is, in part, a way to deal with this, but I'm not a
Firefox developer.)</p>

<p>The "sacred promise" nature of APIs came up recently in a discussion with Johan
Lodin, who wrote Sub::Define.  Sub::Define is a similar module to my
Sub::Install.  (Both, in turn, are reactions to our mixed feelings about
Sub::Installer.)  We talked about the extensibility mechanisms provided by both
our modules.  He said something like, "supporting new behaviors is hard.  How
do you do that in a clean, safe way?  What if you change the interface?"</p>

<p>I responded that, basically, you don't.  You offer a new interface, maybe, but
you leave in some kind of support for the old one.  Otherwise, your users' code
breaks when they upgrade -- and, sure, they should know that upgrading from
0.03 to 2.91 might cause problems, but they'll upgrade anyway.  Once you break
their code by changing things, they will no longer trust you, and you will have
a harder time getting any market penetration.  They will send you angry emails.
(Maybe you don't care.  That's OK, but you should be ready to receive those
emails.)</p>

<p>After talking with Johan, I decided to steal some of his ideas, and got back
into the guts of Sub::Install.  I was not thrilled to find that I'd documented
one interface to a subsystem (which I suggested avoiding), but implemented
another.  My tests were written to the implementation, so they passed.  The
documented interface was superior.</p>

<p>Today, I uploaded a new release to the CPAN.  It has a number of little
improvements, one of which is fixing the code to match the documentation.  I'm
not sure whether I'm breaking a promise now, or mending my ways for a
previously broken one.  More than that, I'm really not sure whether I'm hoping
to receive any "complimentary" angry emails.</p>

The way you've laid it out is not entirely how it went down.<br><br>The problem with the Apache::Request situation was not that they were going to chance Apache::Request 1 to an incompatible Apache::Request 2.<br><br>You would great a major incompatibility, which would mean you had to immediately drop support for Apache::Request 1 (no more releases) and you could only ever have either Apache::Request 1 or Apache::Request 2 installed, you could never have both installed without a completely seperate dedicated Perl install.<br><br>But that has been done before. GD did it. It hurt, but it was their choice. And I for one will never use GD again because of it.<br><br>But the problem was that in doing so, they THOUGHT that they could work around the problem. They thought they could have their cake and eat it too. But they were wrong, and it took a _lot_ to convince them of that.<br><br>The doomed scheme would have ultimately meant changing EVERYTHING else to fit their workaround. They'd already written their own version of MakeMaker, they were starting to write their own version of perldoc (mp2doc!!!), they wanted CPAN changed to suit them, and if they had kept going, we would have seen a gradual expansion to replace pretty much everything with their own versions.<br><br>That was the real problem.<br><br>The point at which things changed was when half a dozen people including me managed to finally convince the mod_perl group that they COULDN'T have their cake and eat it to.<br><br>That the workaround scheme was ultimately unworkable, and that Perl just did not work that way. So the choice they had was either 1. Do a GD.pm, break of legacy support entirely, and go with the complete API change in the same namespace. 2. Do something else (I think I suggested about 5 options at one point) the most attractive of which was moving to a different namespace (Apache2:: being the obvious choise).<br><br>And after much deliberation by the group on the merits, they decided that the level of pain that would be introduced by doing an API change, once the workaround was no longer an option, exceeded the threshold of what they were willing to do to their userbase.<br><br>And so they decided to go with Apache2:: instead.<br><br>The problem was not the API change, it was that the solution to that problem that they'd gone with up until the first release candidate was a bad one.

Yeah, I remember the whole thing pretty well, and I'm glad they ended up changing names.  It was a real nightmare.<br><br>I just simplified, since I wasn't writing really about mod_perl.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
