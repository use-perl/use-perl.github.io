<p><html><p>This is not a coherent, reflective look back.  This is a braindump.</p><p>Adam Kennedy got us to agree on some general princples of distribution building and behavior, which he called the Oslo Accords.  (Actually, he called it the Oslo Agreement, which I think is less amusing, so I&#39;m changing his mind.)  Of the things I cared about, I was in favor of all the things that were accepted, so I am happy.</p><p>One of these things was the recognition of the right of the &#39;xt&#39; testing directory to exist.  It also declared that the best way to specify release tests not in xt was to use the environment variable <code>RELEASE_TESTING</code>.  In light of some of the discussions around this, I am going to drop Module::Install::AuthorTests and create Module::Install::XtraTests (probably ExtraTests, once I&#39;ve had some sleep) and it will let you set up, easily:</p><pre>
./xt
./xt/author   # run if you are the author
./xt/release  # run if you are doing make disttest   
./xt/smoke    # run if $ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING} is true
</pre><p>I think this will be great.</p><p>I&#39;m sad that a few things didn&#39;t get put into the spec (which may or may not be really published by now) for TAP version 14.  I am dying for nested TAP.  I am sad that a few things won&#39;t be available until Test::Builder&#39;s replacement is around.  I really want to have ubiquitous metadata streams.  I am sad that there is no well-documented, feature rich YAML module for Perl -- either in the core or otherwise -- because it would make those streams even better.</p><p>That said, I am very happy with the outcome of the TAP stuff.  Nested TAP didn&#39;t go in because it wasn&#39;t possible to get it in without causing an unknown (but non-zero) number of serious problems out in the CPAN and the darkpan.</p><p>The improvements to Test::Reporter have made it easy for us to add more transports as needed, including a write-to-file transport, which I think Dave released yesterday.  I have not yet decided what kind of bizarre transport to implement to show off.  Someone suggested an IPC::MorseCode transport.</p><p>It looks like Scalar::Util::weaken is going to work on default Debian perl soon.  That&#39;s great.  I have hopes that their perlified OSSI UUID code will soon be on the CPAN, too, meaning that Data::UUID&#39;s unlicensed code can go away.</p><p>With Data::UUID replaced with code that is under a clear license, I&#39;ll be in a position to get my CPANTS board all green.  It will take a while, though, because they&#39;ve added a bunch of new metrics.  It&#39;s driving me to make it easier to do a mostly automated release, since so often the fix is &#34;correct a bogus packaging file.&#34;  I started using the <code>perl-reversion</code> script bundled with Perl::Version and found a few choice bugs, which Dieter fixed in extremely short order.  It now replaced my previous tool, the incredibly tedious:</p><pre>$ perl -pi -e 's/1.234/1.235/g' lib/**/*.pm
</pre><p><code>perl-reversion</code> is more accurate, and it&#39;s easier to say:</p><pre>$ perl-reversion -bump
</pre><p>...and be done with it.</p><p>The metadata repositor that David Golden and I have been working on has been going well.  I&#39;m taking a break from it for now, and I think in a few minutes, I&#39;ll try to establish a 45 minute cycle of USB keydrive updating.  See, we&#39;re on the plane and working with git, so it&#39;s easy for us to keep working, then both push to and pull from a little clone of our repo.  I hear there&#39;s a zeroconf system for sharing git stuff, which I imagine would be just fantastic, if we both had it and were able to use our wireless.  Oh well.</p><p>We&#39;ve both gotten a good bit better at doing things with git, which has been a great boon to us both.  I got to show David how to use <code>screen</code>, which is always nice.  It&#39;s like any other sort of evangelization, but the person on the other side of the conversation basically always ends up converting.</p><p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll think of more things to write about later, but for now it&#39;s time to go get a git clone and then do more hacking. </p></html>
