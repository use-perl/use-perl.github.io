<p><p>An unedited transcript from <code>#vim</code>:</p>

<pre>00:11 -!- Randy_Johnston [n=randyjoh@d27-223.rt-bras.wnvl.centurytel.net] has joined #vim
00:11 <Randy_Johnston> Hi
00:18 -!- daniel [i=daniel@unaffiliated/daniel] has quit [Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)]
00:20 <Randy_Johnston> umm
00:20 <Randy_Johnston> is anyone available?
00:22 <Randy_Johnston> hello?
00:22 <deryni> Asking questions tends to get better answers.
00:22 <Randy_Johnston> hello?
00:22 <Randy_Johnston> sigh
00:22 <Randy_Johnston> I'll figure it out on my own
00:23 <rjbs> ??
00:23 -!- Randy_Johnston [n=randyjoh@d27-223.rt-bras.wnvl.centurytel.net] has left #vim ["wow are you guys jerks"]</pre>

<p>People seem to expect really unrealistic things from IRC, and they seem to be
really angry when their expectations aren't met.  This guy probably thought he
was calling a for-pay help desk, and was expecting someone to say, "Yes,
Citizen, I'm here.  How can I help you?"</p>

<p>For those of you who don't know what he did wrong, here's my free lesson how
how this should have gone:</p>

<pre>00:11 -!- Joe<em>Blow has joined #vim
00:12 <Joe_Bloe> Hi.
00:12 <Joe_Bloe> Every time I paste into Vim, everything gets all indented.  What can I do about that?
00:20 <rjbs> Joe</em>Bloe: Look at :help 'paste'
00:21 <Joe_Bloe> Aha!  That was it, thanks.</pre>

<p>Note that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Joe just asked his question, assuming that oneeee of the 195 users could
answer without first responding to a ACK request.</li>
<li>Joe didn't part when he didn't get an answer immediately, but waited around
until someone replied.</li>
</ol>

<p>I try to be patient with these types, even (sometimes) on #perl, where they are
less welcome than usual.  I send Randy a privmsg telling him that we'd be glad
to help if he'd just come ask his question.  He replied, "no you guys were rude
leave me alone."  Maybe he was a secret agent provocateur sent by the #emacs
crew, but that seems unlikely.</p>

<p>Still, it could be worse.  There was the guy who joined #perl earlier today
looking for help with filehandles.  He wanted to know how to pass symbol names
into a subroutine so he could get at filehandles by symbol name.  I fought off
attempts to force him from the channel, trying to be helpful.  I explained
lexical filehandles and how they'd solve the problem.  "But I need to be able
to store the filehandles in globals!" he protested.</p>

<p>Right.  That's why God invented /kick.</p>
