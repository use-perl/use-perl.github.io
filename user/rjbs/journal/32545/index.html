<p><p>Yesterday was a pretty good day for doing good old fashioned manly things.</p>

<p>Gloria bought me a nice badger-hair shaving brush for St. Valentine's day, and I got myself a new super-old-school double-edged safety razor.  I shaved with it for the first time, yesterday, and it was a pretty good shave.  I think that once I get a little more proficient with it, it will only take a little longer than shaving with canned gel and a cartridge razor, but it's a nice relaxing experience and is supposedly less likely to cause ingrown hairs.</p>

<p>Even this morning, I feel pretty smooth.  The only problem area is my chin.  It makes me see one reason that my father didn't like using a safety razor: that man has a serious dimple.</p>

<p>Later, I went out with Bad Andy and his friend Tom.  We went to International Cigars, the sweet little cigar place downtown.  Apparently, they have a "free cigars and beer" night every Thursday.  Who knew!  We sampled their free beer (the first micro-brew in a can; it was okay), took our free cigars, and headed up to Machs Gute.  One of Andy's friends was there, and I finally ran into Lou, one of my old coworkers from IQE and one of the owners.  We had some burgers and beer and a good time.</p>

<p>It made me think, again, about good old Bertie Wooster and the Drones Club. What ever happened to the gentlemen's club?  Did they die out because of the great depression?  I guess they were probably quite expensive to join (and operate). </p>
