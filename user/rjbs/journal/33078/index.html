<p><html><p>I know that most people know how much email addresses suck, but I found this message in Mutt while looking for something else, and I thought it was a nice illustration.</p><p>A user of Email::Valid writes:</p><blockquote><p>I was doing some testing with Email::Valid, and I came across this:</p><pre> $ perl -MEmail::Valid -e "print Email::Valid->address('dave@#%^&*$.com') ? 'yes' : 'no'"` yes $ </pre><p>This prints &#34;yes&#34;, and I don&#39;t understand why that address would be seen as valid. It doesn&#39;t seem to matter what characters are in the domain part of the address, it always gets marked as valid.</p></blockquote><p>I replied:</p><blockquote><p>Let&#39;s have a look!</p><pre> dave@#%^&*$.com </pre><p>You don&#39;t think this should be valid. Let&#39;s consult the RFC.</p><p>Section 6.1 says that an address must be <addr-spec>. That is:</addr-spec></p><pre> local-part "@" domain </pre><p>I&#39;m guessing you don&#39;t dispute that &#34;dave&#34; is a valid local-part. A <domain> must be:</domain></p><pre> sub-domain *("." sub-domain) </pre><p>I&#39;m also guessing you don&#39;t dispite that &#34;com&#34; is a valid sub- domain. So, is &#34;#%^&#38;*$&#34;? Well, let&#39;s see...</p><pre> sub-domain = domain-ref / domain-literal domain-literal = "[" *(dtext / quoted-pair) "]" domain-ref = atom </pre><p>There are no square brackets, so there is no domain-literal involved. That means that if &#34;#%^&#38;*$&#34; is a valid atom, it is also a valid domain-ref, and the address matches the addr-spec pattern.</p><p>The atom pattern is:</p><pre> atom = 1*<any CHAR except specials, SPACE and CTLs> </pre><p>None of those characters are space or control characters. The specials are:</p><pre> specials = "(" / ")" / "<" / ">" / "@" ; Must be in quoted- / "," / ";" / ":" / "\" / <"> ; string, to use / "." / "[" / "]" </pre><p>None of them are specials, either! Are you shocked? Don&#39;t be! RFC822 sucks!</p><p>I hope this helped. Good night! :)</p></blockquote></html>

<h2>Strange domain names</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2007-04-23T22:56:15</h3>
I wonder, could anyone ever actually register such a weird domain name? Because if not, that would be the difference between theoretically, and practically acceptable.

Right.  In fact, since this email exchange took place, Email::Valid's check that a domain is valid has become more useful, and would reject this.  The only default test is for a fqdn, which has lately come to mean a fqdn for a valid internet domain.<br><br>Still, the awful thing is that the address is valid according to 822, just not deliverable on this Earth's internet.
