<p>The CPAN testers are, in general, a crew of kind-hearted people who perform a valuable service for module authors.  They run tests for all kinds of modules -- even ones that the tester just doesn't care about.  How else would we ever know that XML::Fudge::WithPeanuts doesn't work on OpenVMS/3.2-cray?<br/><br/>Really, though, they are a good bunch and should be applauded and given beer.<br/><br/>That said, every time somebody decides to submit automated test results from a system that doesn't give up if it can't meet a distribution's clearly declared prerequisites, God kills a kitten.<br/><br/>It is not that hard: if you don't meet the prereqs, either instal them or (more likely) give up.  Don't waste my time loading your report, just so I can see that all of Log::Dispatch::LogTable's tests failed because you don't have Log::Dispatch. </p>

<h2>clearly declared prerequisites?</h2>

<p>You mentioned Log::Dispatch::LogTable which I can't find, but perhaps you meant Log::Dispatch::TextTable.  (If not, ignore me).</p>

<p>The Makefile.PL for Log::Dispatch::TextTable lists Test::More as a prerequisite, but doesn't list Log::Dispatch.  Am I missing something?</p>

You are missing the fact that I apparently fixed that problem<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/after/ 0.01, and then did not upload 0.02.  Fortunately, I uploaded 0.02 for an unrelated issue this morning.<br><br>Sigh!<br><br>Well, despite the fact that *I* am the idiot in this situation, the problem I described does exist, and does but me and other people, sometimes.  Oh well.  Let's save this rant for a future time when it's on point, and then I can just point at it, rather than complaining again.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(

<h2>Blame the tools?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2005-12-17T21:24:30</h3>
CPAN testing is an automated process. It would appear to me that this system ought to be smart enough to see that tests fail because of prerequisites that are missing, and simply refuse to send a report. And it looks like it's not, because reports are being sent.<br><br>Oh, I have plenty of more gripes on the module installation tools, for example in their failing to notice that a required (non-perl) library is missing. Now, you only find out because of failing tests. Surely it must be possible to have the C compiler or linker tell the installer that it is missing files?<br><br>

You complaint is actually relevant, please see my <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jonasbn/journal/27154" title="perl.org">journal entry</a perl.org> about problems with the tests.<br><br>In my opinion tests should not be run if prerequisites cannot be met, though missing prerequisites should be reported.<br><br>The test reporting interface is VERY open, but I think it is important that is remains open and easy to use.<br><br>jonasbn
