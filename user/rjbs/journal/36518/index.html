<p><html><p>Andy Lester posted <a href="http://perlbuzz.com/2008/05/the-stuff-i-wanna-see-at-yapcna-2008.html">his YAPC::NA
schedule</a>,
so I thought I&#39;d post my tentative plan.  I often change my mind at the last
minute, but:</p><h2>Monday:</h2><p><em>Skimmable Code</em>: Schwern talks about how to make code maintainable.
Maintainability is my watchword.</p><p>Either <em>Unicode for Silly Americans</em> or <em>Handling the Ball of Mud</em>.  I had
really been looking forward to the Unicode talk, but necessity forced me to
learn a lot of the material likely to be covered, these past few weeks.</p><p><em>Email Hates the Living!</em> -- I&#39;m pretty much required to attend this one.</p><p><em>PAR + PDF + FUSE</em>.  I&#39;m hoping to learn how to do stuff with FUSE, but even if
not, it just seems too weird to skip.</p><h2>Tuesday:</h2><p>I feel obliged to see one of the other horror-title-themed talks, <em>Perl is
unDead</em>.</p><p>I&#39;m certain to go see Dave Rolsky talk about <em>Fey</em>.  At work, we often make
offhanded comments about how Rolskyware is reliable, well-designed, and a good
default choice.  I&#39;m hoping Fey will delight.</p><p>I&#39;m also really looking forward to seeing Josh ben Jore talk about the <em>Perl 5
VM</em>.  He&#39;s definitely one of the people I&#39;d want to hear talk about it, and
&#34;Symphony of Horror&#34; makes it obligatory.</p><p>Kevin Falcone&#39;s talk on timezones, <em>Why can&#39;t we all live in Greenwich?</em>, looks
like it could be useful -- although I&#39;m doing a lot of learning on that right
now.  It also is the only talk that lets me not walk out mid-talk to deliver
one of my talks:  <em>The Joy of S&#39;Ex</em>.</p><p>I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;ll be doing the rest of the day, Tuesday, but I feel likely
to end up at Michael Peters&#39; <em>Buildbot and Smolder</em> talk.</p><h2>Wednesday:</h2><p>Well, I know I&#39;ll be at my talk, <em>Everything You Always Wanted to Know about
S&#39;Ex (But Were Afraid to Ask)</em>.</p><p>I&#39;ll probably also get to Schwern&#39;s <em>What is Obvious?</em> talk, as it&#39;s a favorite
question of mine.</p><p>Apart from that, I&#39;m not sure yet.  I&#39;m hoping to have a lightning talk ready,
but I have plenty of slides to make before I start thinking about that.</p><p>I think this year&#39;s YAPC will be great (again!).  I&#39;m looking forward to it.</p></html>
