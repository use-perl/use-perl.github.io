<p><p>Tomorrow begins my trip to YAPC::NA::2006.  I'm really looking forward to this year's YAPC.  The talks look exceptionally interesting, and I'm going to be giving on myself.  I've been spending a lot of time poking at it and poking at the code I'm presenting (Sub::Exporter), deciding what things I feel like trying to show off.</p>

<p>I'm also excited because there will be a PEP BOF.  BOFs are small, unofficial meetings held at conferences.  I'm not a fan of the name, but it's fairly traditional, now.  PEP is the Perl Email Project, which is a project for making Perl an awesome language to use for dealing with email.  I work at Pobox, where we are in love with email, so I am looking forward to sharing the love with everyone else.  The PEP has been languishing for a while, so the prospect of helping it get going (and stay going!) is one I relish.</p>

<p>I'm about to post this, sync my offline IMAP, and then pack up.  I am attempting to fit all my needs into my Timbuk2, which would be a great accomplishment.  (Failing that, I'll use a bookbag for my clothes.)  Tomorrow, Gloria will drive John and me to the Philly airport by way of Waffle House. Then we're off to O'Hare.</p>

<p>If you're going to Chicago, come say hello! </p>

<p>Cool! It would be nice if the various long-outstanding bugs in RT could finally be fixed. I love the Email:: stuff, and I&#8217;d love to see it all become robust enough to do away with the older modules.</p>
