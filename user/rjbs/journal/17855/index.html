<p>Tuesday was my first visit to the Lehigh Valley Linux Users Group, forming two nights of geekery in a row. The LUG was larger in membership than ABE.pm, which wasn't surprising.<br/><br/>Faber, who also had come to the Perl Mongers, gave a talk about screen(1). It was good to see more people learn about screen, which is the awesome. For the most part it was nothing new, although I learned that the sessionname command works better than when last I looked. Also, I don't think I'd ever seen the " menu before, but I also don't think I'll use it in the future. There were less silly things said than I'd predicted, and I wouldn't feel right about laughing at a few of them in public. One, though, was said (possibly in earnest) by a spastic teen who seems to be a tolerated regular: "Hey, you could use this to make nethack multiplayer!"<br/><br/>I thought the screen talk was sufficient, but there was more: a brief overview of Linux certification. I thought it would get ugly, and it did. People act like certification is some kind of plot to force everyone to become incompetent and unemployable. I don't understand this point of view. Certification is nothing more than a way to sell oneself to HR by getting someone trusted to vouch for you. No one's required to have certification, unless he wants to get hired by a company that demands it, and it's not a totally outlandish demand.<br/><br/>Despite this, the term "anal rape" came up.</p>
