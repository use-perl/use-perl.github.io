<p>Gloria and I took Duan to breakfast and the airport this morning.  More accurately, Gloria drove Duan and me, and Duan treated Gloria and me.  I sort of sat around and tried not to wince every time I moved.  My back and neck have been incredibly sore!  We went to the Cracker Barrel in Clinton, and breakfast was pretty good.  Their grits were actually just fine, which Gloria says was not the case at the Fogelsville Cracker Barrel.<br/><br/>On the way home, we picked up my bike, which now has a much happier front shock.  I got some new tires (smoke/dart) and we came home.  We did the usual Saturday downtown things: ice cream, shopping, talking to the Chocolate Lady. At home, we watched Bride of Re-Animator, which had its moments, but was mostly bad.  During the movie, I put my new front tire on the wheel, and started to put on the rear tire.  I had a hell of a time with it, though, and ended up breaking both of my tire levers.  Once I'd calmed down, we headed over to Action Wheels, and they got the bead seated for me, which was very nice of them.<br/><br/>We headed over to Hollywood, but found nothing incredibly motivating, except for Grand Theft Auto, which I picked up.  So far, so good.  My impression remains this: If I only wanted to by one game between yesterday and January, it would still be Metroid Prime 2. </p>
