<div class="span8">
<p>I've been meaning to move to Subversion for quite a while, now.  Maybe it's been a year, I don't know.  I've been using it for Module::Starter, but that's because Andy owns the repo for that.  I used it for minicpan2, but that hasn't been very active.  Every time I start some new chunk of code, I think, "I should put this into svn!"  Then I think, "but I'm not sure how I'm supposed to do that trunk/tags/branches thing, and I think I screwed up my repository to begin with, and isn't all this thinking about svn just a way to shave yaks while I put off writing the code?"  Maybe it was, but "needing to get the code committed right now" was a reciprocal yak-shaving to keep me from moving to svn.<br/><br/>Well, now my yak is bald!  Before OSCON, I put "move code to svn" on my todo list, thinking I'd be incredibly inspired by the svn tutorial there.  I wasn't, frankly, but it was odd.  I found myself saying, "This tutorial is not inspiring me to change... but I already decided to change!  I will not let this be yet another reason to postpone."  My resolve was strengthened, and this week I acted on it.<br/><br/>I updated cheshire's svn to 1.2.1, which also gave me a reason to update SWIG and Ruby.  I installed cvs2svn, which gave me a reason to install Python.  I removed my nearly-empty and probably-badly-done svn repository and built a new one.  cvs2svn was a pain, because I actually have used tagging and branching. I decided to skip it and do what I'd planned on doing from the beginning: import fresh copies.  I updated my CVS checkouts, cleaned them up, removed their CVS directories, reorganized them, and reimported them.  It took an hour or two, mostly because I didn't bother automating a lot of it and did it while watching the second disc of Homicide (which is quite good, by the way).<br/><br/>Now I have moved all my Perl code from CVS to Subversion, and I have a few things left to move: configuration files, my writing, and non-Perl code.  That should take much less time, for a number of reasons.  I know I've got a good number of little tasks and discoveries awaiting me (I have to turn on keywords for some files, I have to install the svn Module::Release plugin, I need to play with svk), but I'm feeling pretty good about the move.  During my overlong contemplation, last night, about how to structure my repository, I realized, "Hey!  If it sucks, I can move things around later."  Ah, freedom!<br/><br/>I only have one worry, at the moment.  I know that I can tag things by copying to a tag directory, but I don't really want to have to type the entire repository URL twice just to do so.  This concern applies to a number of similar operations.  "svn+ssh://svn.manxome.org/home/rjbs/svn/stuff/thing" is just too much.  I want something like $CVSROOT, but I don't think it exists. (Sure, I can use my own environment variable for this, but I feel put out even by that.)  Anyway, time will tell whether I care.  My prediction is that I'll be elated to realize that the awesomeness of svn makes it easy to write an svntag script that does the right thing by looking in ./.svn for paths. Wouldn't it be nice if that already exists?  (I'm on the bus, I can't google for it right now.) </p>

<h2>Repository URL</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2005-08-09T16:39:58</h3>
<p>I usually just do "svn info" in the current directory and cut'n'paste as much repository URL in place as I need.  It's a very lazy way of doing things though.

<h2>SVK</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/schwern/">schwern</a> on 2005-08-09T21:23:35</h3>
I rapidly tired of all the URLs in SVN.  SVK cuts most of that crap out.  As a bonus no<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.svn directories and offline commits!  Give it a shot.  You still keep your SVN repo, SVK just talks to it.
