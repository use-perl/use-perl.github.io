<p>I have been putting off writing anything down here because I want to wait for some things to be finalized before I talk about all the big stuff that's been keeping me so busy and stressed out, but I thought I'd jot a few things down. If I don't, I never will, and anyway this is a little sign of life.<br/><br/>Today, Gloria and I went out with Katie and Jerome.  We got Greek food and saw Little Miss Sunshine.  Those were both good ideas.  I had a car door close on my finger, which wasn't so good.  It was mostly just painful; nothing broke or ruptured, except for maybe some cappillaries.  Typing feels weird, but doesn't really hurt very much.<br/><br/>We went way over our cell phone minutes last month.  I didn't realize how much the per minute charge was for overages.  Yow!  I called today to change to a better plan and I was informed that there's a plan that will cost the same, give us twice the minutes, and not require any contract extension.  Why did I have to call them to find this out?  Still, cool.  I am hoping to soon entirely ditch our landline, so this change should help.<br/><br/>At work, I just finished implementing a very bare boned and lightweight RPC system that we're hoping to use in obsoleting some old software.  Doing so gave me a chance to play with PyYAML, and I must say: it is totally fantastic.  I'd probably have some complaints if I used it for all kinds of insane things, but for doing some non-trivial stuff, it really blows YAML.pm and YAML::Syck out of the water.  I am really looking forward to seeing the TPF-sponsored port of PyYAML to Perl.  It will make a lot of difference in the way Perl programmers can benefit from YAML.<br/><br/>I think that's about as much as I want to type tonight.  I hope to have a lot more to say on Thursday. </p>

So how does it compare to YAML::Tiny?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Well, I haven't looked at it lately.  Last I saw, it didn't support inline content.  That means I can't use it:  I need to parse YAML created by other languages.  Once that works, it will be a lot closer to usable for me.<br><br>Unfortunately, what I really need is tagging support; you and I talked about this a good while ago, and I might write a patch for it.  I'm pretty sure it could be done in under 25 lines...
