<div class="span8">
<p><html><p>Yesterday, we headed downtown and watched the parade for Celtic Classic.  It was okay, but I was disappointed by my high school&#39;s lackluster regimentation. A scoop of maple walnut ice cream dulled the pain.</p><p>Saturday evening was the night for my local RPG, and I felt it was a success because when I said, &#34;let&#39;s stop there for the night,&#34; I got grumbles of disappointment.</p><p>I got nearly no reading done this weekend, breaking a decent streak of getting stuff read.  I recently finished Fer-de-Lance (the first Nero Wolfe mystery), The Light Fantastic (the second Discworld book), two Fletch books, and some other light reading.  All I&#39;m really working on right now is the third-to-last Jeeves and Wooster book.  When that&#39;s done, I&#39;ll finish Gravitas, and then maybe I&#39;ll get some more weighty reading done.  I really want to finish reading Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader, which I began well before MJ was born.</p><p>MJ was pretty good this weekend, despite a few crabby patches -- quite possibly due to the fact that her sleep schedule was forced to bend to our whims.</p><p>This morning, my sister&#39;s family and I installed a new Mac for my mom, secretly replacing her old, awful Dell.  I&#39;m sure she&#39;s still being confused by bits of it, but I think it will definitely be a better fit for her, in the long run. This week, I&#39;ll need to make sure I get her set up for remote desktop, so I can just crash in with VNC and Fix Stuff.  For now, ssh should suffice.</p><p>I made very little progress on anything technical, although I installed Vecto, a Common Lisp vector graphics drawing library that looks like it promises to be fun, if I can figure out something fun to do with it.</p><p>Tomorrow, I&#39;ll get to use my EVDO modem on the road again, and I look forward to deciding that I can once and for all cancel T-Mobile Total Internet.  I won&#39;t be cancelling my T-Mobile service, though.  Early termination would cost me $400 ($200 each for our two phones), and I don&#39;t think there would be any benefit for moving to Sprint, other than just having one bill.  T-Mobile&#39;s customer service has nearly always been very good, while Sprint&#39;s has, so far, been mediocre.  Since I lost my RAZR and needed a new GSM phone, I hit up eBay yesterday and placed an order for a Samsung D807, which I hope to receive early this week.  I decided I want to try a slider, and it looked like the best-reviewed one near my price range.</p><p>I also wouldn&#39;t object, tomorrow, to finishing a rough-but-deliverable draft of my 5.10 talk for Pittsburgh so that I can get cracking on my App::Cmd talk, which is going to be much harder to produce.</p><p>For now, it&#39;s time to sleep. </p></html>
