<p><html><p>In case anyone has been thinking, &#34;Gosh, I haven&#39;t seen anything from rjbs
lately,&#34; the reason is ridiculous.  It&#39;s not that I&#39;ve been busy (but I have)
or lazy (but I am).  It&#39;s that I&#39;ve been stupid.</p><p>When I relocated some of my hosted services to Linode (who, by the way, are
awesome), I decided that running Rubric as a CGI script was insane.  It&#39;s
always been slow and inefficient, and I knew I could make it much, much faster
by making the process persistent.  On my previous host, where
<a href="http://thisismystation.com">TIMS</a> also ran, I saw how much faster Rubric could
be under mod_perl, but I had some minor problems and wasn&#39;t interested in
futzing with Apache, which I vaguely dislike.</p><p>On my new host, I switched everything to lighttpd, and I figured I&#39;d use
FastCGI.  I thought this would be trivial, but the state of the art for moving
CGI things to FastCGI seemed to be lousy.  Someone finally pointed me at Stevan
Little&#39;s fantastic FCGI::Engine.  It did exactly what I wanted, making Rubric
work with no code changes at all... or so I thought.</p><p>First, query parameters stopped changing.  The first query to hit the daemon
would have its <code>QUERY_STRING</code> parsed and nothing else would ever get looked at.
I fixed that by shoving an <code>initialize_globals</code> call in Rubric&#39;s run method.
Things seemed alright until I tried to log in to post.  No matter what, HTTP
POST requests were coming through with no content.  I stared at it until I gave
up, and then I couldn&#39;t post anything new because I couldn&#39;t log in.</p><p>That was that, until tonight.  I checked on my Hiveminder todo list and saw 78
things to do.  (Good grief!)  The second one is a reminder to get new App::Cmd
stuff done by a week ago, and I thought, &#34;Gosh.  I should get that done, and
then post an explanation of why the changes are so good.&#34;</p><p>Then I thought, &#34;I can&#39;t post anything new, my Rubric won&#39;t let me log in!&#34;</p><p>Then I thought, &#34;I need to fix Rubric under FastCGI before I start on any of
the other 78 things in my todo list.&#34;  I guess this is a story about being
lazy and busy, too.</p><p>I resorted to looking through the source of Rubric, CGI::Application, FCGI,
FCGI::Engine, and other things.  I finally noticed that FCGI::Engine passed a
CGI::Simple query into the code it called -- a fact that was not documented.
Once I added the dozen-or-so characters needed to tell Rubric to use that query
instead of a newly-built one, everything just worked.  Awesome!  Once again, it
goes to show that reading the source is always a good strategy.</p><p>I&#39;ve filed a ticket suggesting that the docs should mention the parameter.</p><p>Now I need to get to work posting old news!</p></html>
