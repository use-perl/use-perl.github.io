<p>Metroid Prime 2 remains great.  I had my second boss battle today, and it was good.  I now have quite a bit of new gear, and I'm enjoying doing all the usual Metroid stuff.  Around 20:00, Gloria had been home (from teaching Yoga) for a little while, and I thought we'd watch some of the Jeeves and Wooster we had from Netflix.  It took me nearly forty minutes to find the next save station, having just entered a new zone.  There should never come a point in playing a game where you are frustrated that you can't turn it off without losing a lot of work.  Ever.<br/><br/>Work was quite busy today, which was refreshing.  I got to hack together a few quick scripts to solve small urgent problems, and I had to learn and then teach three-dimensional lookups in Excel.  (Awful!)  I think there's been some amount of cramming going on because people know I won't be in next week, and they want to get next week's work fit into today and tomorrow.  Fine with me! </p>
