<p>Today, work was less crisis-oriented than it had been.  I spoke with Duan, who thinks that the current crisis at the UK plant may have been worked around sufficietly well for now.  (Note to self:  write up options summary tomorrow anyway.)  Trevor thinks he found and eliminated the cause of the server crashes; I'm guessing this was a success since I made it past 1900 without any phone calls.  I started getting some of the databases moved from one server to another, which is not something I'm excited about doing, but so far so good.<br/><br/>Trevor cancelled his TiVo subscription, and I got it transferred over.  Its settings screen still displays his name for it, but it's responding to my remote scheduling requests, so I'm not too worried.<br/><br/>Simon showed #perl a mockup of an Expose-like feature for Desktop Manager from the author's blog, and the idea trail lead back to Virtue, another OS X desktop manager that uses a lot of ideas from both Desktop Manager and QuickSilver. I'm sort of torn on using it, because it has a lot of nice new things and is missing a lot of small important things.<br/><br/>I can change the wallpaper on virts, but it's slow.  I can change the background color by overlaying a new color (with alpha channel), but it covers my GeekTool output, so I can't use an opaque color.  I can use a watermark image, but I can't center it.  I can assign keys to lots of things, but not ot "move this desktop left or right."  I'm hoping the author will at least stop storing things in "~/Virtual Desktops" in the next release!<br/><br/>Gloria made some tasty soup for dinner, and we watched some things TiVo had picked up: a documentary on Suzanne Vega which was interesting, but old and short; a documentary on "what is federalism?" which was interesting, but basic. We also watched two Netflix movies that have been just sitting here for a while: Mutiny on the Bounty and The Wild Bunch.  They're part of my "see all the AFI Top 100" project.<br/><br/>Mutiny on the Bounty was pretty darn good.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I like Clark Gable.  The Wild Bunch did not please me.  After I had to turn the DVD over, I gave up and put it away.  Ugh.  I didn't like it, it didn't catch my interest at all, and I felt like I was wasting my time on it.<br/><br/>I got a little work done on Rubric today, mostly fixing stupid little bugs and tweaking templates.  I also wrote a little script to make it easy to post notes to my Rubric with Vim.  It only works locally, though; I need to either get syncing working or get it working via LWP.  The latter seems much easier.<br/><br/>Tomorrow will be full: lots of work at work, lots of TiVo to watch, and maybe even some personal code to write.<br/><br/>Oh!  And I'll try to start my Thursday by talking about a fun little timeline chart that I'm trying to trick Excel into generating. </p>
