<p>If the internet was a person, it would be a reverse Charlie (from Flowers for Algernon).  It would start out as an interesting, convivial thinker and degrade into a dirty old man in a yellow raincoat yelling about "throat yogurt" and "herbal viagel."<br/><br/>I have a new campaign: to get men to leave the toilet seat up in public restrooms.  That way, people who are too lazy to put it up /before/ peeing won't have to, and when you /do/ need to sit, the seat won't be disgusting. Put the seat up yourself, and convince your friends.  Someday, maybe you won't need to spend time picking the least disgusting stall.<br/><br/>When reading "The Unix Philosophy" this summer, I took pause at some turn of phrase Gancarz used.  I don't remember what it was, but it made me realize something that should have been entirely obvious long ago: the reason we call software that can be used on many platforms "portable" is that we can carry it with us, like a portable computer.  I'd never realized that "to port [to another platform]" meant to carry.  It really made me think, although I don't remember what I actually thought /about/. </p>
