<p><html><p>I stopped by the local gun (and coin and antique) store on Thursday and asked
them to see if they could acquire a Yugo SKS for me.  They said it might be a
pain, as recent &#34;scares&#34; have created a rush, not to mention &#34;the Democrats
getting back in power.&#34;  This is funny both because it was said out loud and
because it is probably true.  Ha ha only depressing.</p><p>I&#39;m thinking that I may be willing to &#34;settle&#34; for an AK-47, if I can&#39;t get a
SKS easily enough, although at that point maybe an M1 Garand isn&#39;t much more
expensive.  I&#39;ll ask The Gun Guy next time I talk to him.</p><p>I was looking at small gun safes, but I think that since my primary goal is
preventing underage access, I&#39;ll be fine with good weapon locks and a lockable
container, like a big tub or drum.</p><p>While discussing my options with some friends at my RPG the other day, one of
them asked, &#34;So, uh, what does Gloria think of this plan of yours?&#34; and I
related this snippet, taken verbatim from AIM logs:</p><pre><rjbs> Do you have any interest in learning how to safely and accurately
operate a rifle?
<gloria> maybe.
<gloria> I mean - in the case of zombies, it couldn't hurt to know.
</pre><p>Yeah.  She&#39;s <em>so</em> the girl for me.</p></html>

But you were just in Texas.  Why didn't you just pick up one of each in the airport gift store?

Of course! I'm from Australian and even I know that like every 3rd person in Texas carries a concealed Zombie!

SKS, Garand, and AK47.<br/><br/>Pretty sure zombies are regulated in Texas.

At least you're getting something with no pretension whatsoever that it would be for "home defense"... phhttt<br><br>I vote the Guarand! It's the gun that goes *ping*<br><br>
