<p><html><p>For a long time, my parents have been held hostage by AOL.  AOL, for ages, made
it nearly impossible to use any tool other than their mega-integrated awful
front end to The Internet.  Even once they set up IMAP, you were stuck with
their Favorites and Address Book.  This was a big deal for my dad, who has a
gigantic contact list.  I&#39;ve been heckling him to use Apple&#39;s Address Book for
ages, but he couldn&#39;t get out.</p><p>Recently, AOL published the <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/internet_utilities/aolserviceassistant.html">AOL Service
Assistant</a>,
which lets you set up your Mac to work with your AOL settings.  Most of this is
trivial, but it exports your AOL Favorites (read: bookmarks) and your Address
Book.  This was great news, and I put it to use when setting up a new Mac for
my mom a few weeks ago.</p><p>The big snag was that it exports contacts in a completely asinine way.  As far
as I can tell, AOL&#39;s contact list has no concept of &#34;person&#34; or &#34;group.&#34;  It
just associates a name with a list of one or more email addresses.  When you
export your contact list to Address Book, each entry becomes a group, and each
address in it becomes a person.  That means that if you had
&#34;grandma@example.com&#34; as the address for your &#34;Nanny Smith&#34; entry, you will now
have a group called &#34;Nanny Smith&#34; with one person.  That person will have no
name, just an email address.</p><p>This is totally insane.</p><p>Mac::Glue made fixing this a whole lot less hateful than it might have
otherwise been.  Here&#39;s the script I used:</p><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

use Mac::Glue ':glue';

my $addr = Mac::Glue->new('Address Book');

my @groups = $addr->prop('groups')->get;

my %emails_for;
my %groups_for;

for my $group (@groups) {
  my $name = $group->prop('name')->get;
  my @people = $group->prop('people')->get;

  if (@people == 1) {
    # a one-address group is probably a person
    my $person = $people[0];
    my ($email) = map { $_->prop('value')->get } $person->prop('email')->get;
    push @{ $emails_for{ $name } ||= [] }, $email;
  } else {
    # ...but a multipe-address group is probably a group for real real
    my @emails =
      map { $_->prop('value')->get }
      map { $_->prop('email')->get }
      @people;

    for my $email (@emails) {
      push @{ $groups_for{ $email } ||= [] }, $name;
    }
  }
}

my %local_part;
for my $email (keys %groups_for) {
  print "$email\n";
  my ($local_part) = split /\@/, $email;

  unless (grep { $_ eq $email } map { @$_ } values %emails_for) {
    my $i = ++ $local_part{ $local_part };
    $emails_for{"$local_part $i"} = [ $email ];
  }
}

# Okay, we've learned all we can, let's obliterate all the bogus cards.
$_->delete for $addr->prop('people')->get;

for my $name (keys %emails_for) {
  my @emails = @{ $emails_for{ $name } };

  my ($first, $last);
  ($first, $last) = split / /, $name, 2;

  # Set up the address book card
  my $person = $addr->make(
    new => 'person',
    with_properties => {
      'first name' => $first,
      'last name'  => $last,
    },
  );

  # Add the person's email addresses
  for my $email (@emails) {
    $addr->make(
      new => 'email',
      at  => location(end => $person->prop('emails')),
      with_properties => {
        label => 'Home',
        value => $email,
      }
    );
  }

  # Put each individual back into the groups in which they originally appeared.
  my %group;
  $seen{ $_ }++ for map { @{ $groups_for{ $_ } || [] } } @emails;

  for (keys %group) {
    next unless my $group = $addr->obj(group => whose(name => equals => $_));

    $person->add(to => $group);
  }
}
</pre><p>Basically, it converts any group with only one address into a person.  For any
group that had more than one address, if it can find a &#34;person&#34; for that
address (in other words, that address appeared in another group with no other
addresses) then the group remains a group, now with that person (and probably
others) in it.  It&#39;s not perfect, but it got my mom&#39;s 200+ member contact list
into a state where hand-correcting it was not a huge problem.</p><p>I&#39;d like to think that AOL will fix this in a future release, but I doubt it.
I think that it&#39;s not just awful programming, it&#39;s a mismatch between the data
structures of AOL&#39;s and Apple&#39;s address books.</p></html>

Not only is it a data mismatch, I don't think there are any programmers left to fix the problem if even someone wanted to. This last layoff caught a lot of people in product development. Tools like this will go unmaintained while the remaining programmers try and keep the core properties and code online.

Granted I only worked on the edge of the address book (integrating the ab into a wap email client) but I find it had to imagine that is the best they can do. 7 years ago they had a http protocol that would allow you to export the ab using a couple of dozen lines of perl.
