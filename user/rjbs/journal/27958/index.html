<p>I just had the weirdest experience.<br/><br/>I often sit cross-legged, and I was doing so as I read my morning news, replied to some email, and looked over the overnight reports from work.  When it was getting close to time to go, I got up to go take a shower and realized that both of my legs had fallen asleep.  This wasn't the sort of pins and needle sleep that makes it uncomfortable to walk: they were both completely unresponsive to my mind's commands.  (I have no idea how I managed to stand up.)  I took one or two faltering steps, swinging my dead legs and assuming they'd quickly get to work, but then I realized that this was not going to happen, and that I had no chance to get back to the sofa.<br/><br/>I tried to lean on something or turn around, but it was no use.  I fell backwards onto the coffee table and sat on my laptop.<br/><br/>Fortunately, it was not broken!  It turned off, for some reason, but that's OK. It turned back on with no problem.  The lid still stays in place, and there are no horrible noises coming from it.<br/><br/>It was pretty scary for about five seconds there, though. </p>

I'm saying this because the basic ideas on your post are:<br><br>* I ceased feeling or being able to control my legs<br>* I fell on my laptop<br>* Fortunately, my laptop is OK<br><br>So... WHAT ABOUT YOUR LEGS?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-D

<p>Yes. I think "Hey I have lost total control of my legs" would be my great sigh when they came back to life.</p>

<h2>That dead feeling...</h2>

<p>I used to keep my alarm clock across the room from my bed, so I'd have to leave the comfort of warm blankets to turn off the alarm.</p>

<p>One morning, I discovered that I'd been sleeping in a position that cut off circulation to my legs.</p>

<p>When the alarm went off, I did my usual throw-back-the-covers and dash-across-the-room bit - but found myself face down on the carpet without realizing how I'd gotten there!  I tried to stand up three times before it sunk in to my fogged brain that something was amiss.</p>

<p>Eventually, I crawled over to the alarm and turned it off.  After that, I lurched around in circles until function was restored.</p>

<p>Strange feeling, eh?  Betrayed by your own body like that with no warning?</p>
