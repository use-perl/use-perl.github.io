<div class="span8">
<p>Last night, I "finished" the single player campaign in Halo 2.  Why the scare quotes, you ask?  It's not because I wasn't playing Legendary (I was playing Normal).  It's that Halo 2 didn't have a very satisfying ending.  I heard no end of complaining about this in the internets, so I was pretty well prepared.<br/><br/>The thing that got me is this: the ads kept telling me that I'd get to save Earth, but then I only spent about half an hour there before heading out to Halo 2, never to return.  The game was better than Halo in quite a few ways, but the ending was a disappointment.  I'm joining the club of people who believe that the "real" ending will be downloadable content.  We'll get three or four more chapters that end Halo 2 and set up Halo 3.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed in myself when I gave the first level a go at Legendary.  Oof!  Maybe I'll try Heroic.  Or, more likely, I'll get more Live play in.  Paul seems to have a good crew put together, and maybe I can get in on some of their games.<br/><br/>I also ended up giving myself a copy of Chessmaster.  I'd gotten a copy for my brother, but probing suggested that he wasn't super interested, and he /finally/ made a wish list, so I got him something I knew he'd want. Chessmaster kept crashing, but now Halo's done it, and I think I just need to clean the reader in my Xbox.  I have really, really mixed feelings about Chessmater.<br/><br/>It has incredible user interface problems.  Every game on Xbox seems to use the same text-entry system: it displays a keyboard or alphabet, and you move around and pick the letters you want, then hit A.  In Chessmaster, it's more like an old arcade game.  Your cursor has a letter over it, and you can cycle through the available characters with up and down.  Deleting and inserting characters is really awkward.  Also, I feels like I felt about Chessmaster on the PS/2: It seems like I need to hold the button in for a moment longer than in other games.  Maybe it's just me.<br/><br/>That's not the big thing, though.  The big thing is worse.  There are two settings for the AI's consumption of time: limited and unlimited.  When it's set to limited, each move takes less than a second.  When it's set to unlimited, the AI will never move -- or maybe it waits until it's computed every possible game tree.  I keep losing on time.  Maybe the AI wouldn't lose on time anyway, but I'd feel better if it at least used five seconds while I used five minutes.  I use sixty times the time and still get trounced.<br/><br/>How trounced?  Right now, Chessmaster is ranking me around 350 or so.  If you don't know chess rankings, this is something like, "Well, I know the rules, but I don't understand strategy."  I must improve my game, I think, before going on line.  Last time I complained about chess opportunities, I got a few offers.  I will definitely be taking those people up on it.<br/><br/>I'd like to find a nice, relaxing Xbox game, preferably one that can be played Live.  I don't know if such a beast exists, or if it could possibly be relaxing online.  I keep imagining playing Animal Crossing online and having someone yell at me: "YOUR FURNITURE IS ASS, FAG!" </p>

I'm currently just inside level 9 (although that's only the highest one, as Live only reports the top number.  My other ratings are at <a href="http://www.bungie.net/Stats/PlayerStats.aspx?player=Chaoticset" title="bungie.net">bungie.net's stats system</a bungie.net>, which also has an RSS feed of recent games.)
<p>
Unfortunately, you can't currently get clan feeds, but I'm sure that'll happen eventually.</p>
