<p>I really want to test drive a Kinesis Ergo.  I hear (mostly) rave reviews, but I don't want to buy a $250 input device, just to find that I can't use it.<br/><br/>I've been using a Belkin split-key keyboard.  It feels good, and I've gotten used to it, except for its horrid enter key.  It has the big L-shaped enter, which puts the backslash in a stupid place.  The legs are on the near side of the keyboard, to putting them down raises the near end, which is a better position.<br/><br/>I just raided the IT room and found two other options.  The MS Natural keyboard has a better enter key, but feels squishier.  Also, its legs are at the rear, and it has a (*gasp!*) cross-shaped set of arrow keys.  WTF?!  Also, it doesn't feature the Belkin's lovely split spacebar.<br/><br/>There's also a wireless Logitech keyboard.  Wireless is a plus, and it has a nice-sized enter key.  The keys have a better feel than the MS keyboard, but its legs are in the wrong place.<br/><br/>I think I'm going to ask Kinesis if there's a way to test drive their devices here on the east coast.  I want to stop thinking about my input device and just use it. </p>

I love it I love it I love it I love it!&lt;/voice type="molly shannon"&gt;<br> <br>I can't say enough good things about the <a href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/professional.htm" title="kinesis-ergo.com">contour professional</a kinesis-ergo.com>.  The contour classic is also a great keyboard (It was my last keyboard), but I wouldn't buy the essential.  Keyborad programmability is too important to me.  Remapping escape to a thumb key and puttting shift on the foot pedal are probably the two things that have saved me the most wrist-ache.<br> <br>-- Douglas Hunter<br>



<h2>More important</h2>

Be sure to go Dvorak though. I've been using it for about 18 months, and that makes far more difference than the actual hardware.

My brain has trouble believing that it can use both Dvorak AND vi.

<h2>you could borrow one of mine...</h2>

<p>...if you lived in Pittsburgh. I have three: one (Classic) for work, one USB (Advantage) for the Powerbook and one PS/2 (Classic) for a linux machine I rarely boot up anymore.

</p><p>I could not do my job without this keyboard, and I've <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/search/?keywords=kinesis" title="cwinters.com">written about it</a cwinters.com> multiple times (probably the <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/news/display/?news_id=995" title="cwinters.com">best here</a cwinters.com>).</p>
