<p><html><p>App::Cmd::Tester lets you test that an App::Cmd program output the right things
to standard error and standard out, and did so in the right order.  It does
stuff Test::Output can do, but also just a bit more.</p><p>I had a need to generalize this earlier today, and ran into a bunch of
obnoxious problems.  Most of these center around the &#34;it&#39;s hard to get
synchronized but separate output from a spawned program&#39;s stderr and stdout&#34;
problem.  Others were less well-known, at least to me.</p><p>For example, I was doing something like this:</p><pre>tie my $scalar, 'Tie::Class', { common => \$string, private => \$other };
</pre><p>I had a number of things like this, and I thought I&#39;d be able to write:</p><pre>tie my $scalar, $object->tie_args;
</pre><p>This didn&#39;t work, though, because the <code>tie_args</code> method gets called in scalar
context, so it evaluated to the hash reference, which of course had no
<code>TIESCALAR</code> method.</p><p>Instead, I ended up doing something possibly better anyway:</p><pre>tie my $scalar, $object, $argument;
</pre><p>The object has a <code>TIESCALAR</code> method that proxies to the correct class with the
correct arguments.  I&#39;m pretty happy with that.</p><p>The other problem is this:</p><pre>tie my $scalar, 'Some::Tie';
open my $fh, '>', \$scalar or die "failed to open ref: $!";
print $fh "this is a test" or die "failed to print: $!;
</pre><p>This code just doesn&#39;t do what I mean.  It doesn&#39;t raise any exceptions, but
the <code>STORE</code> method is never called on the tie.  This seems, to me, like a bug
in perl.  I&#39;ll need to investigate.</p><p>The code I was working on has been uploaded as IO::TieCombine.</p></html>
