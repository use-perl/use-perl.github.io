<p>I'm not sure I can name anything that I'd call an accomplishment from this weekend.  I did a lot of sitting around and thinking about doing things, but I still felt busy for a good amount of the time.  Although my time could have been better used, I think that for the most part it was a good, relaxing weekend hanging out with Gloria.<br/><br/>We watched a bunch of movies: Dominion: a Prequel to the Exorcist, Salem's Lot, When Worlds Collide, and... well, I think there was something else.  Dominion was, I think, really very good.  We rate everything we watch at Netflix (even if we rent it from 48 Hours), and I gave it four out of five stars.  I wanted to give it five, but it's hard to think of it as being on the same plane as, say, The Godfather or All Quiet on the Western Front.  It was a high four, though.  There were some horror elements to the movie, but for the most part it was really about good, evil, and faith.  I thought it was actually a pretty moving film.  There is one very powerful (but brief) exchange that I would ove to relate here, but instead I will just say: go see the movie.<br/><br/>We had some ice cream, got omlettes at Billy's, and stopped by my parents' place to talk to my mom and do some printing.  (I've been looking at printers again, but I'm not sold.)<br/><br/>I really need to get some final work done for my upcoming RPGs, though. There's just one week until Game Zero in Philly and two weeks until the first real session here in Bethlehem.  Yikes! </p>
