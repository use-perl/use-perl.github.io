<p><html><p>So, right.  I got an iPhone.  Among other things, this means that I will now start writing about what apps I like, once in a while.</p><p>I&#39;ve had my phone for three or four days now, and here&#39;s what I&#39;m using so far:</p><p>I&#39;ve installed Exposure and ShoZu for interacting with Flickr.  Exposure is basically a Flickr browser and ShoZu is an uploader.  ShoZu actually can upload to all kinds of things, but the only one I care about is Flickr.  Getting them set up was a little annoying, mostly because typing a 20+ character password with letters (in both cases), numbers, and punctuation is a real pain.  I wish there was a &#34;do not hide password as I type&#34; option so I could compare passwords before hitting &#34;save&#34; and finding out they&#39;re wrong.</p><p>I installed TouchRPN, a really cool little units-aware RPN calculator.  I think it needs more work, and I need a bit more practice using it.  It&#39;s the only application I&#39;ve felt interested enough to spend any money on, though.  A few of the other RPN calculators on the iTunes store made the same moronic mistake Apple did with their previous version of an RPN calculator: only one element of the stack visible, ever.  Errr...</p><p>I&#39;ve installed NetNewsWire, which means I&#39;ve more or less had to start using NewsGator syncing.  I don&#39;t like it.  NNW for iPhone also bugs me in a lot of ways.  It&#39;s time to start filing bugs and feature requests!  Still, NNW for Mac is great, so I&#39;m not about to switch to something else that doens&#39;t sync between iPhone and Mac.  I&#39;m a captive audience!</p><p>I installed Pandora, which has worked well, so far.  I&#39;m a big fan of Pandora, so I&#39;m not surprised.  I hear some people like AOL Radio better, but I don&#39;t see a reason to switch, yet.  I did install AIM, but mostly as a stopgap until there&#39;s some sort of libpurple-based IM client with some kind of system for acting backgrounded.</p><p>I installed the Jott program, which will probably be sort of useful, but not extremely.  Why can&#39;t I use it to send things to my Jott Feeds?  Also, a visual interface to Jott with Jott Links would be fantastic.</p><p>I installed Twinkle, but I still don&#39;t see much microblogging in my future. Mostly I find the whole concept annoying.  I installed Banner Free and More Cowbell, both just for giggles.  I installed the Evernote client, but it seems really slow and buggy so far.  Again, I&#39;m wishing that Evernote was built-in to my systems, rather than being a separate app.</p><p>I installed the Apple Remote, which seems like it might be more useful than I was expecting.  It makes me want to get an Apple TV and some better speakers for home, though, which is dangerous.  I also installed the music app Shazam, which identifies recorded music by listening to a twelve-second clip.  So far, it&#39;s been really impressive.  I haven&#39;t had much use for it, though.  It&#39;s just neat.</p><p>Finally, I installed Aurora Feint, despite the recent hoohah about their privacy problems.  The game looks fun, and so far it is.</p><p>I look forward to even cooler apps over the next few months.  Maybe I&#39;ll even try to write one myself. </p></html>
