<p>Tonight, I knew where my towel was.  It was on the third hook from the shower entrance.  That's the one directly over the plug and one to the right.  It was there when I went into the shower, hung on top of my locker key.<br/><br/>When I left the shower, my towel was gone, and my key was there.  If it was an honest mistake, why didn't the towel-taker realize immediately that it wasn't his towel.  He left the key, after all!<br/><br/>I patted myself down with my clothes and got dressed.  You never appreciate how useful a towel is until you have none!<br/><br/>Work was uneventful.  I hit a few CGI upload related problems, installed some software on a new server, and got generally fed up with Microsoft.<br/><br/>At home, I'm working on Rubric 0.05, which is just the "write some freaking tests!" release.  So far, I've got coverage up from about 30 to about 40 percent.  I'm just getting the low-hanging fruit for now, calling methods that are in use all over the place except the test suite.<br/><br/>I read more of Stealing Sheep at the gym, and I'm finding it interesting, but I'm worried about the way that he (so far) seems to think that it's never, ever OK to leave one local church for another.  Still, I'm less than half done.<br/><br/>My hands hurt.  I'm going to bed. </p>

I will check it out.  One of the authors lives in Allentown, which is the next town over.  Neat!<br> <br>My first check on RSI things is always: does it talk about the kind of pain I have?  My fingers always get to hurting, but most books and sites talk about wrist pain.<br> <br>Thanks for the pointer!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

<p>"I read more of Stealing Sheep at the gym, and I'm finding it interesting, but I'm worried about the way that he (so far) seems to think that it's never, ever OK to leave one local church for another. Still, I'm less than half done."

</p><p>While I don't agree with "never", I do think that people do take being a church member way to lightly. That is why you see a church on every corner in some places. People get offended over one thing and they leave. It doesn't matter how petty that thing was or even if it was biblically correct and they just didn't want to hear it. So they leave for a church to isn't so "meddling". My church split because the pastor died and a divorced man wanted to be the new pastor. Well that isn't biblical. So instead of staying, he split the church and started his own knowing full well he wasn't biblically qualified. Unfortunately, that happens all the time.

</p><p>I can see leaving over <b>dotrinal</b> differences but little else should make one leave a church that they are a member of.</p>

That's pretty much what I think.  I think there are a few reasons that it makes sense.  So far, the author seems to be implying that any departure from your "home church" is rending the flesh of Christ.  I'll post more when I find out whether he gets around to exceptions, or makes it clear that he's not trying to assert this for every single case.
