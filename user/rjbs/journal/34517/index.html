<p><html><p>The trip in this morning was miserable for EVDO connection.  I could barely stay online for more than a few minutes at a time.  I had at least one kernel panic.  Eventually, I dialed into T-Mobile&#39;s network over my RAZR, only to be reminded how painfully slow it is.  EVDO is totally awesome... when it works.</p><p>I had started out, from home, running a continuous ping of Google, so I could later see how the connection fared.  Eventually I killed it, it was pointless. The connection sucked everywhere -- mostly, it seemed, because the modem was flipping out for no clear reason.</p><p>Later on during my work day, I called Sprint to ask them what was up.  The rep asked me to hold for a minute while he checked something, then hung up on me. When I called back, I got put on hold so long that I had to leave work to get to the bus.  I tried calling from the walk to the bus, but the Sprint automated support system won&#39;t take your call if you don&#39;t know your phone number.</p><p>I&#39;m supposed to know the number of my outbound-only modem?</p><p>Oh, and if you have the number in front of you, but fat-finger a digit, you get hung up on.  There&#39;s no second chance.  You get to call back in and navigate your way back through the menus to number entry.</p><p>Now I&#39;m on the bus on the way home.  I&#39;m staying online for longer stretches, although I&#39;m still more or less inside greater Philadelphia.  I had a kernel panic earlier.  It seems these are not entirely unknown:</p><pre>http://www.evdoforums.com/thread5367.html

</pre><p>Many users, including Randal, suggest the U720 instead of the 595U.  Sprint doesn&#39;t sell it anymore, so I might end up buying one at full price from ... somewhere.  At least that will leave me out of a contract.</p><p>Seriously, this is nuts.  The EVDO service is so incredibly great that I&#39;m considering using it, even if it means one kernel panic per trip, as long as I can just stay online for most of it... and that makes me feel ridiculous.</p><p>I think that tonight I&#39;ll have to find out how I can get my hands on a U720 to test. </p></html>
