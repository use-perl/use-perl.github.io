<p>My office has been a big mess, especially since all my things from my IQE office invaded it.  I kept meaning to clean it, and finally I put it on my To Do list.  I put it off for a few days, but the shame of writing the same thing over and over on my daily list finally caught up with me and I started cleaning up.  So far, in cleaning out some Really Old boxes from the shelf in the office closet, I have found the following things:<br/><br/>My Really Small Coin Collection: Mostly it's state quarters and a number of historical whole dollars (Saca, Susan, Ike, Morgan, etc.).<br/><br/>Lots of Old Games:  Ultima VI and VII, various Quests from Sierra, Civ II Gold, SMAC and SMAX, Myth, MechCommander, and others.  I was so excited to remember that I had MechCommander that I installed it and played a mission.  See, when I first acquired MC, my PC was too lame to play it.  My PC is now more than capable, so it's fun to putter about.  What a great game!  Strategy games are lots of fun, even if I suck.  (All told, I'm not really that cunning, I guess.)<br/><br/>Stationary: I found a lot of paper and envelopes printed with maps, an "Esperanto: la unua elekto por la dua lingvo" notepad, a full-size letter notepad full of Esperanto homework, some blank hand-made cards from my mother's mother, and a few more bits of stationary.<br/><br/>Manuals Galore: manual for my TV, my other TV, my camera, my other camera, my speakers, and all kinds of other things.<br/><br/>IQE Paperwork: hiring papers, 401k papers, medical benefits papers (for the three kinds of coverage I had while there), reviews, and more.<br/><br/>Hardware:  the only thing worth mentioning under this header is my old LPT scanner.  (Anybody want one?)<br/><br/>Office Supplies:  The best thing, here, is the pen refills for my really nice steel pen that BU gave me as a graduation present.  I also found a refill for my favorite pens (Zebra F-301), a box of Sharpies, some dry erase markers, a huge quantity of replacement erasers for Zebra M-301 pencils, white out, and a blue flipchart marker.<br/><br/>A steel cigarette case: it's empty, has no real odor, and looks like it could be engraved with a monogram.  Anyone have any suggestions for repurposing it?<br/><br/>Well, maybe that's it.  (Oh, I also found a huge bottle of fluid for my eyeglass-cleaning spritz.)  I've gotten a lot of it thrown out or better organized, but I know I won't be done cleaning up before I leave for YAPC. Doh! </p>

<h2>Repurposing The Cigarette Case</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmcada/">jmcada</a> on 2005-06-24T18:53:15</h3>
I use a cigarette case for a wallet (actually, I think that it was built to be either).  The hard sides and small size keep me from lugging a bunch of stuff around that I don't need.  Just be careful with putting it in your back pocket... the corners will dig through the fabric.
