<p><html><p>I&#39;m at the Pittsburgh Perl Workshop this weekend, giving a few talks and listening to a few others.  I&#39;ll write more about that later.  Here&#39;s the coolest thing I think I&#39;ve learned so far.</p><p>OpenID is a authentication system that lets you have something like single sign-on for the whole wide Internet.  It&#39;s not a single service, but rather a standard to adhere to, so it&#39;s not like MS Passport, in which MS held your keys, and so always knew just what you were doing.</p><p>Kirsten Jones gave a talk called &#34;OpenID is the New Black.&#34;  She talked about how OpenID works, how you&#39;d use it to authenticate users, and how it&#39;s really great.  It is!  I&#39;ve wanted to get set up with it for a while, but I didn&#39;t really like the idea of being attached to any of the existing OpenID providers. That is, I didn&#39;t want to have to establish my username everywhere as rjbs.livejournal.com or anything like that.  I figured I&#39;d either set up an OpenID provider for manxome.org (ugh) or wait to see if Pobox.com will provide OpenID.  Neither option made &#34;open id today&#34; seem likely.  Kirsten&#39;s talk reminded me how much I wanted to get OpenID set up.</p><p>I mentioned this on IRC, and Jon Rockway said, &#34;You can just delegate any HTTP URL you own to another provided.  That&#39;s what I do.&#34;  He couldn&#39;t remember just how it worked off the top of his head, and I was hungry for it, so I did some googling.</p><p>It&#39;s right there in the spec, although it doesn&#39;t seem well advertised.  I didn&#39;t see it talked about much, even though to me it&#39;s pretty killer!  It lets you have your own domain use anybody else for authentication, and you can swap out your OpenID provider any time you want!  Awesome!</p><p>Basically, I added two lines, like these two (but different) to <code>/index.html</code> on my web site:</p><pre><link rel="openid.server" href="http://www.livejournal.com/openid/server.bml">   <link rel="openid.delegate" href="http://rjbs.livejournal.com/">
</pre><p>Now, I can point people at my web page to authenticate via OpenID.  Done! </p></html>
