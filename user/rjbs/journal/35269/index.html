<p><html><p><a href="http://blogs.sackheads.org/hide/">hide</a> recently told me that he&#39;d moved from
Quicksilver to LaunchBar.  I try to do whatever the Canadians do, since I hear
they will soon be our new overlords.  I figured I&#39;d do what I do with most
commercial software:  download it and use it during its trial period until it
became clear that it was worth the money, or until I was so irritated at it
that I had to stop.</p><p>The LaunchBar demo period is seven searches.  <em>Seven searches</em>.  I didn&#39;t
realize this, at first.  I was surprised to see that it uses the same default
keybinding as Spotlight, but I changed it to use the binding from Quicksilver.
I opened two or three things and thought that it seemed much faster, and that
it might be worth $20 if it ended up being faster and more stable than
Quicksilver.  I looked for how to use non-default actions, like &#34;add this track
to play next in Party Shuffle.&#34;  While doing that, I was told that I needed to
restart LaunchBar.  I couldn&#39;t even use it for a day to make up my mind,
because I&#39;d constantly be restarting it.</p><p>I guess they saved me $20.</p></html>
