<p><html><p>So, I finally own a pair of shorts, again.  I owned about four, I think.  I&#39;ve put on a fair bit of weight (ugh) since I stopped going to the gym, and some of my shorts no longer fit.  One pair lost a button, but was mostly wearable with a belt, and the other pair split up the back while I was doing yardwork.  For weeks, I&#39;ve been wearing trousers for everything.  I nearly ruined a pair while wearing them to haul and lay down sod.  Ugh!</p><p>Today, we made a trip to Old Navy and I got two pair of really comfortable cargo pants for about $20 total.  Nice!  They had quite a few colors, but I had to settle for two pair in the same color to get my size.  The color, no kidding, is called &#34;buffalo herd.&#34;  I was a little miffed to be unable to get khaki or black, but Gloria reminded me that Old Navy has a pretty decent online store.</p><p>I went online, enabled Flash for the site, and ordered a pair in &#34;black&#34; and &#34;fisherman&#39;s khaki.&#34;  Checkout was alright, although 1Password had some trouble filling in the flash form for my address.  When I got to &#34;pick a password,&#34; I let 1Password pick something random, only afterwards to be told that I had to limit myself to numbers and letters.  Ugh.</p><p>The really annoying part was that when I tried to change the form, I clicked in the password input area and hit backspace... which was sent to my browser, which went back to a previous page, canceling my checkout process.  Ugh!</p><p>Oh well.  Filling in a form twice is a small price to pay for being able to wear something other than long pants.  (I am not counting the price to my conscience at buying clothes probably manufactured in a sweat shop.  I try not to think about that.) </p></html>
