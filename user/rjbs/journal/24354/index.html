<p>written: 2005-04-22 18:19<br/><br/>Gloria and I are in Florida.  We got here around noon on Wednesday, and have done a lot of driving around and shopping and eating.  Tonight we'll go to a barbeque, and tomorrow we'll go to Jen's wedding, at the beach.<br/><br/>I haven't really gotten much done, although I had meant to try to use this time away from work to my advantage.  I finished listening to Life of Pi, and the ending was very satisfying.  I was moved, despite myself.  I've been reading in Higher-Order Perl again, and it remains really, really good.  I find when I begin any given chapter, I can go through it very rapidly, thinking, "I know this stuff!  I'm great!"  As I get further on in the chapter, though, it takes me five minute or more to read a single page, as I slowly work my way, step by step, through the code.  It speaks to the book's quality that I must carefully think about fifteen line samples of code and that, when I find I understand it, I feel really excited.<br/><br/>Yesterday, we ate at a Thai buffet and a upscale Greek restaurant.  I had padh thai, chicken cashew, red snapper with feta, bread pudding, kataifi, and spring rolls.  Today, I had a really good Cuban sandwich and some Nutella on a piece of bread.  When we get home, I will have to really return to sane eating.<br/><br/>The one thing I have accomplished is adding an offline mode to my journal-posting script.  I can write more than one entry and let them sit in a spool until the script can post.  It's got a number of problems that I can already see -- they'll crop up if I ever go offline while posting.  Also, there are some silly theoretical race conditions and, as you can see, it doesn't properly use the writing date as the posting date.<br/><br/>Whatever!  It lets me keep writing entries while I'm in the internet diaspora. I should buy my father in law a wireless router. </p>
