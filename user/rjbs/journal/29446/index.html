<p><p>At first, I wrote this introduction to this entry:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know what kind of iPod Shuffle accessory would make it really, really
  great.  I'm not sure what it would look like, how it would work, or how much
  it would cost, but I still want it:  an auxiliary entropy source.  Today, I
  found myself listening to the same handful of artists from the beginning of
  the alphabet.  I'll start my Shuffle now and we'll see what it wants to play.
  I'll stop when something doesn't fall into the pattern:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Black Sabbath, The Wizard</li>
<li>Black 47, Time to Go</li>
<li>Cake, Sad Songs and Waltzes</li>
<li>Black 47, Born to Be Free</li>
<li>Bob Dylan, Mozambique</li>
<li>Bruce Springsteen, Downtown Train</li>
<li>Bob Dylan, Thin Man's Blues (?)</li>
<li>Breeders</li>
<li>Bjork</li>
<li>Bush, Glycerine</li>
<li>Coldplay</li>
<li>Bob Dylan</li>
<li>Boomtown Rats</li>
<li>Cars, You Might Think</li>
<li>Bob Dylan</li>
<li>Buena Vista Social Club</li>
<li>Bone Thugs'n'Harmony</li>
<li>Blue Oyster Cult</li>
<li>Bone Thugs'n'Harmony</li>
<li>Buena Vista Social Club</li>
<li>Bob Dylan</li>
<li>Black Sabbath, The Wizard (again!)</li>
<li>Butthole Surfers</li>
<li>Busta Rhymes</li>
<li>Black Sheep, Strobelight Honey</li>
<li>Bob Dylan, House of the Rising Sun</li>

<li>Blackstreet</li>
<li>Black Sabbath, Changes (again!)</li>
<li>Bjork, Human Behavior</li>
<li>Cars, You Might Think (again!)</li>
<li>Black 47, Born to be Free (again!)</li>
<li>Black Sabbath, The Wizard (x3)</li>
<li>Bone Thugs-n-Harmony</li>
</ul>

<p>By this point, though, I got suspicious.  I stopped to review my actual
playlist.  My Shuffle, which is supposed to contain everything from my Shuffle
playlist -- that's 103 songs at the moment -- instead contains thirty-five
songs.  Some of them, like Bjork, don't even appear in my Shuffle playlist at
the moment.</p>

<p>Sometimes I really, really wish that the iPod devices kept their database of
music in a really easy to read (documented) format.  If they did, I could
easily write my own software to build and sync playlists.  I could still have
playlists like those I've enjoyed for so long, but I could make them much more
enjoyable with constraints like, "no more than n% of playlist contents may be
from a single artist."</p>

<p>When a friend of mine started talking about getting an iAudio recently, I
replied to his LVLUG posting saying that I was too addicted to the "last
played" and "play count" and "rating" features supported by iTunes and the iPod
players.  This is both a blessing and a curse.  I can build really useful smart
playlists, but I'm chained to the slow, bloated iTunes player when working at
my laptop, and I'm stuck with lousy syncing on the shuffle and glaring feature
omissions on all the smart playlists.  Don't get me started on the fact that
iTunes still doesn't have a "Update Playlist Contents" context menu item for
non-auto-updating smart playlists.</p>

<p>Will someone please release a reasonable mp3 player that keeps track of these
things?  I am longing to abandon iTunes, but until something else can deal with
iPod's database, or until another player can produce this kind of data, I am
too addicted.</p>
