<p>Andy and Bill suggested a few books in their "getting a great job" talk, and I picked up two of them last week: "The Brand You 50" and "Ask the Headhunter." They're full of good advice, but I wouldn't really suggest either of them, especially if you can get your hands on the slides from the talk or, better, can witness the talk itself.  It condenses all of the useful information in the books (and more) into one sitting.<br/><br/>Ask the Headhunter is basically a book on how to interview well, and is rooted in these basics: you should not need to master "interview skills" to impress HR; your interview is your opportunity to <em>show</em> your future boss that you can do the job he wants done.  The other 199 pages of the book are just supporting material and tips on how to do that.  It's a great idea, but twenty pages would have sufficed.<br/><br/>The Brand You entreats the reader to think of himself as a freelancer whose skills are a product that any employer should know about and desire.  In other words, "You are a brand!"  This idea plays well with Ask the Headhunter's, but I have a hard time reading it.  For one thing, the author is <em>really</em> excited about <em>everything</em> and does horrible things to convey his excitement.  His prose is full of bold print, variable-size fonts, too many exclamation points, and lots of interjections.  Maybe some people love this kind of writing, but I'm not them.<br/><br/>The short version of this post, anyway, is this:  Andy and Bill read these books so you don't have to.  Benefit from that work. </p>

<h2>Kind words</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2004-08-29T22:02:43</h3>
Thanks for the kind words. For more job stuff, see <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5461" title="oreillynet.com">"The worst way to start a resume"</a oreillynet.com>, and I'm going to post a followup soon, "The worst way to start a job interview."
<p>
<i>BrandYou 50</i> isn't really about hiring, but about a state of mind, about how to face your career.

And the slides are with all the other <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5345" title="oreillynet.com">OSCON 2004 slides</a oreillynet.com>.</p>



<h2>What about subliminal messages?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cog/">cog</a> on 2004-08-30T09:53:33</h3>
What if I go to a job interview and try to pass a subliminal message to the interviewer? Say... by having a shirt stating "Hire Me!" O:-)

<p>Would that work?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) I think I'll try, someday<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>

"Ask the Headhunter" would suggest, rather, a shirt that says, "I work here."  Unfortunately, I've only ever seen shirts that say "I do not work here."  Let me know if you print up those shirts, especially if you put a nice hypnotic pattern on them.

I might... I just might...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) And this is something I'll be discussing in my journal pretty soon, I believe...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
