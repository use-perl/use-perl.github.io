<p>The layoffs continue.  A problem with shift work is that it takes time to get through a round of layoffs.  They should be done by now, though.  Maybe I'll look into things before I go to bed.<br/><br/>I didn't get a lot of work done.  It's always hard to focus while things like this go on.  Still, I was pretty busy, considering!  I did a smidgen more work on Epitaxy::Substrate, but nothing really useful.  Instead, I got started on Number::Tolerant, which I'll be putting on the CPAN soonish.  It creates an object that is overloaded to act like a number, but the number represents a number with a tolerance.  So, the number (5 ÃÂ± 1) is less than 7, equal to 4.3, and not greater than 4.9.<br/><br/>I'm happy with it.  There are a number of ways to specify ranges, and tomorrow I'm going to try to make them and-able, so a bitwise and creates their intersecting range as a tolerant number.  I was thinking about supporting some basic math, but it will be too hard and not very useful.  So, KISS.<br/><br/>One hundred tests passing is good for an evening's work, I think.  Yeah, I should admit: a lot of this code was written this evening, not at work.<br/><br/>So, what was I busy with at work?  Well, I helped Calvin refactor some code, explaining references (barely) as I went.  We had a meeting in which I got to hear about more finance reporting stuff that made me grumble.  I know there was more, but I'm too tired to recall the tawdry details.<br/><br/>I did some cycling after work, which was good except for going through some nettles.  Gloria and I had awesome fake chicken nuggets for dinner, with lima beans (also tasty) and buffalo sauce.  We watched some Farscape.<br/><br/>That's about it for my day.<br/><br/>Oh, and one other thing.  For some reason my journal on use.perl.org keeps looking like it's not allowing comments.  I don't know what's up.  When I edit my entries, they say comments are OK.  I need to harass pudge.  Thanks to Geoff Y. for pointing this out! </p>
