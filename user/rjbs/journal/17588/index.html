<p>I had wanted to get some things done today, but I got nearly nothing done. For one thing, I wanted to hash out the obnoxious little problems with Bryar's handling of categories in flat text-file data. Maybe tomorrow. Until then, my journal will remain sketchy. Still, it's good enough for basic reading.<br/><br/>I had wanted to review my IF games and see how to make progress, but I just didn't. I had wanted to work on my iTunes toys, but Mac::iTunes seems broken again, and I tapped the "Blame Someone Else" card, rather than do work.<br/><br/>I did see that ABE.pm got posted to Use Perl, and I've heard from some more interested mongers. I'm looking forward to meeting zero, but I'm also anxious. I have no idea what the hell I'm doing, people! I figure as long as I fake it, and as long as no one actually /reads/ this, I'm safe.<br/><br/>I need to start making a week plan. Hopefully I can make a simple pattern for it, like "my web projects Monday, game coding Tuesday, play video games and watch TV Wednesday, learn something new Thursday, enjoy the company of my wife Friday and Saturday, random topic Sunday." My fortune cookie remains in my wallet. I must heed it. The pants command me!</p>
