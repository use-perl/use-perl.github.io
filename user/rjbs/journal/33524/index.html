<p><html><p>I&#39;ve got a bunch of documents that I want to organize, and I didn&#39;t want to use some database system, or rely on Spotlight (which I loathe) or anything annoying like that. I wanted a different set of annoyances. I wrote a little module (File::LinkTree::Builder) to build a tree of directories based on file metadata leading back to files in a storage area. So, given (say) my iTunes library, it could build a tree in which I could look up /Rock/80s/Island and find every rock track from Island Records in the 80&#39;s. The module is very simple and it lets you define how to find metadata.</p><p>Since a lot of the files I want to deal with are PDF, I thought I&#39;d look into its own metadata system. It has two, but the extensible one is XMP, the eXtensible Metadata Platform, which embeds a bunch of XML/RDF in the PDF. PDF::API2 has a way to get and replace this, so I figured I&#39;d be on my way.</p><p>Well, the docs suck, and there&#39;s no non-image-related XMP module on the CPAN. I thought I&#39;d just use XML::Simple, but I have to deal with goofy processing instructions, which it doesn&#39;t seem to support. I&#39;m getting close to just doing something brute-forcey. Worst case, maybe I&#39;ll put YAML in a CDATA block and see whether it gets deleted by some Adobe tool while I&#39;m not looking.</p><p>During my research into XMP, I found this, the most unhelpful technical documentation ever: http://support.adobe.com/devsup/devsup.nsf/docs/51963.htm </p></html>

<p>I wrote me <a href="http://corion.net/perl-dev" title="corion.net">FFRIndexed</a corion.net>, back when it became clear that WinFS would not be built into Windows. It has a webserver and a DAV server to export something like a filesystem that is organized along the dimensions of the metadata. The key point of my system is that it only offers those dimensions as "subdirectories" which offer a real refinement, that is, which reduce the size of the result set, but are not trivial reductions to <i>n</i> one-element subsets.</p>
<p>If you're interested in sharing your metadata collectors, I'd like to hear from you!</p>
