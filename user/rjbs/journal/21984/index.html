<p>I want to RELAX on my vacation.  Sometimes, I relax by playing video games. Even if I get frustrated, they are usually fun.  GTA:SA is not being fun, right now.<br/><br/>I am on the "flying school" missions.  I have to complete ten flying tests, which are not fun.  They are difficult, and I know that I am not going to need many of the skills they are trying to give me.  Meanwhile, all my other available missions are locked off.  I can't do more missions for other people until these are done... except for the RC Zero mission with the miniature planes, which also sucks.  I finally had to stop playing, because I didn't want to destroy my controller.<br/><br/>I guess it's time to do some coding. </p>

<h2>GTA:SA Giveaway</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jbisbee/">jbisbee</a> on 2004-11-24T16:37:44</h3>
I finally gave my copy of GTA:SA to a friend because it was sucking the life right out me.  It was fun, (but not that fun when I look up at the clock an realize that 4 hours have gone by and I haven't _really_ accomplished anything)
<p>
I also found it distrubing that I would go to the virtual gym, but have trouble doing it in real life lately.
</p><p>
Fuck you very much Grand Theft Auto, I beat you in a very <b>real</b> way by going cold turkey and passed your curse on to someone less fortunate! <a href="http://users.adelphia.net/user/wrenn123/sounds/creature/laugh01.wav" title="adelphia.net">&lt;Insert Evil Laugh Sound Effect Here&gt;</a adelphia.net></p>

<p>I you have a PS/2 I'd suggest <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/schwern/journal/21475" title="perl.org">Katamari Damacy</a perl.org>.  Simple controls.  Simple yet challenging gameplay.  The goals are set fairly low so its hard to get stuck on a mission, let there's lots to do beyond your goal so you can continue along.  Best of all, nothing you do can hurt you!  Its all just timing.

</p><p>What else that's relaxing... I find Dungeon Keeper 2 relaxing.  In a bad mood?  TOURTURE SOME HEROES!  Slap some imps.  Watch the dominatrixes torture each other...

</p><p>More PS/2 games.  Rez and Frequency.  Rez is a deceptively simple shooter with a musical element such that what you do in the game effects the background music.  Oh, and there's <a href="http://www.gamegirladvance.com/archives/2002/10/26/sex_in_games_rezvibrator.html" title="gamegirladvance.com">this</a gamegirladvance.com>.  Frequency is sort of like DDR or Karaoke for those who have more hand-eye coordination than foot-eye or voice talent.</p>

I have Katamari Damacy, Rez, and Frequency. Also, Amplitude (Frequency's sequel).  I was considering playing some of those today, but: KD is loaned out, Rez gets frustrating come area 5, and... no reason not to play some Amplitude, maybe!  Maybe later.  I've been trying to use my frustration as a reason to work on Rubric, but without a huge amount of success.  I'll have to look into Dungeon Keeper 2.  Thanks for the suggestions!<br> <br>Maybe I'll play some Steel Battalion.  Nothing say vacation like massive mecha.

You shelled out the $100 for Steel Battalion?!  Wow.  I am in awe of your gaming dedication.

Man, I love Dungeon Keeper. Bullfrog real did this game well. I liked how the time and date you played could open secret levels and such.<br> <br>Now I gotta go find it...
