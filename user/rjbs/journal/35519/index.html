<p><html><p>About a week ago I upgraded my hard drive, which was much less simple than it
might have been, largely because of an incredibly overtightened screw.</p><p>Today, I was sitting on the bus, working, when suddenly my laptop shut off.  It
wouldn&#39;t come back on.  At work, on the AC power, it was fine, but it sometimes
showed that I had no battery at all in my computer.  Toward the end of the day,
while it was claiming I had no battery, I yanked the power.  I&#39;d done this
while it said there <em>was</em> power, earlier, and nothing had happened.  This time
my laptop immediately shut off.  Looking in the battery compartment, I made a
horrifying discovery.  The third, originally over-tightened screw on the
L-bracket in the battery compartment was not fastened.  Worse, it didn&#39;t seem
like it would stay fastened.  Unscrewing it had, perhaps, caused some kind of
damage.  I fiddled with the battery and brought it back online, and it rebooted
itself once or twice before giving me a login.  I put it to sleep and headed to
the bus.</p><p>At the bus stop, I found that my laptop was, once again, off.  I used a little
scrap of paper, folded into a shim, to hold the L-bracket in place, and the
laptop turned on.  It would repeatedly get to the grey boot screen, then
reboot.  It did this over and over.</p><p>Basically, I had no laptop use for the majority of my ride to and from
Philadelphia today.  By coincidence, I did not have headphones with me, or a
pad of paper, or a book.  I made some notes on some index cards and tried to
nap.</p><p>When I got home, I tried to use Disk Utility to recover my drive, but the
filesystem seemed too far gone.  It was time to format and restore.</p><p>My backup was from the 24th, and I back up a few key directories several times
a day.  Still, this was a serious pain.  I don&#39;t back up to Time Machine often
enough because it means going upstairs and plugging into my firewire drive on
my desk.  I&#39;d love to update my backups over the wireless, but Apple pulled
that feature before release.  I could get a Time Capsule, which wouldn&#39;t be so
bad, except I&#39;m really irked at buying an 802.11n access point when I can&#39;t
upgrade my MacBook (rev A) past 802.11g.  There have been rumors that 10.5.2
will let me use a normal (cheaper) AirPort with an external drive.  I also
might just try backing up to a drive on my Ubuntu machine.  We&#39;ll see.</p><p>Anyway, once again: Apple&#39;s stupid hardware techs caused me grief, but their
excellent backup software helped make me care a lot less.  If you&#39;re reading
this, Apple, you can buy my total forgiveness: just send me a Time Capsule, and
maybe a MacBook with newer networking hardware.

That's my working theory, as my drive has otherwise not exhibited problems I could detect.  That said, I was also surprised by it.
