<p>We headed to Mr. V's this morning for breakfast.  Mister V's Blues Cafe is in the site where Hack's was; they've been open for about a month now, and this was our third trip there.  I wanted to get eggs, sausage, toast, and grits.<br/><br/>We hung around in the vestibule for a while before some tables opened up.  We sat down and the waitress took the order of a couple of ladies who came in after us.  (Directly after us, to be fair.)  Then she took the order of a couple who had come in before us.  Then she wandered around for a while.  The hostess (or some higher-ranking woman) asked whether our order had been taken, and I said, "No."  So, she talked to the waitress, who walked around for a while more.  Finally, completely sick of it, we got up and walked out.  As we walked past the waitress, who was standing near the entrance, she said, "I apologize, guys."<br/><br/>What the hell?  Next time, don't need to apologize.  Just ask us what we'd like!  Hack's used to take ages to serve our food, but it took no time to get our drinks and get our order in.<br/><br/>We walked down the block to Billy's.  It cost a few bucks extra, but we got served quickly, and I got scrapple.  I'll go back to V's again, sometime, but not when they're busy, and probably not if that waitress is on duty. </p>

First of all Mr. V's did not open until July 30th, so you were there less than two weeks after the establishment opened.  Have you ever tried to start up a business on your own and everything run smoothly the first couple of weeks?
<br>
<br>
I was a Hack's loyal customer amd I had to wait for coffee many a times, especially if Karen was off and a certain young man was cooking and his girlfriend was waitressing and they were fighting at the time.
<br>
<br>
Stay away from V's because judgemental people, such as yourself, just stink up the plave with your smugness and bad karma.  It's too bad.  You are really missing out on some great and <b>HEALTHY <b>food (one thing you didn't find at Hack's).</b></b>

I've been back a few times in the last year.  Obviously I liked the place, or I wouldn't have gone there three times in the first few weeks to begin with.  Mr. V's clearly has the best burger's in town, especially for the price.  Van's grits are great, too, and it's nice to have a place nearby where I can get gazpacho.<br><br>On the other hand, most things are too expensive for what I've gotten, at least in my opinion.  I think that every time I've gotten soup, the price-to-portion ratio has varied wildly.<br><br>I sure did have to wait a long time at Hack's, too.  A few times I left there after half an hour without a glass of water, especially if it was one particular waitress.  I don't see how that means that it's OK if the new business does the same thing.<br><br>Slow food service is one thing, but waiting half an hour just to get a glass of water or coffee is another.<br><br>I don't know why you think I'm missing out on Mister V's.  You certainly didn't ask whether I've been back.
