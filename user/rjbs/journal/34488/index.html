<p><html><p>I&#39;ve been a Speakeasy customer for about seven years now, and a Service Electric TV customer for about as long.  Come next week, though, I will no longer be either.  I am switching to RCN cable TV and cable modem.</p><p>I had hoped I could switch to Service Electric&#39;s cable modem package, provided by PenTeleData, but their AUP is insane.  First of all, it&#39;s only available as a Word document.  What!?</p><p>Secondly, doesn&#39;t allow running any sort of &#34;information service&#34; of any kind. I can cope with not allowing me to run a mail server or web server on port 80. I think it&#39;s stupid, but I could cope.  It bans, though any &#34;kind of software that runs a service operating on the [customer&#39;s] computer which offers access to their computer for individuals on the Internet.&#34;  I will pretend that this doesn&#39;t include ping responses.  It means that I&#39;m not allowed to run sshd, and that they can terminate me at any time if I do.</p><p>Meanwhile, they want to tempt me with &#34;1 residential homepage with 15MB storage&#34; and &#34;5 email address with 50MB storage&#34; and &#34;Free pop up blocker and spam blocking.&#34;  Their whole service seems like it&#39;s living in 2001, except for their speeds, which are modern.</p><p>Speakeasy, on the other hand, has modern service, but is still charging something like $70 monthly for 1.5/384.</p><p>I look forward to RCN.  My father has it, and he seems to have no significant problems.  It&#39;ll cost less than half what my DSL did, and I&#39;m hoping to pay for that myself and get work to pay for my EVDO instead of my landline broadband. Everybody wins! </p></html>
