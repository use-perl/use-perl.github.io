<p>Today was a Monday, and I went to work last Monday, so I didn't go today.  I stayed home to try and get work done, but I kept getting emergencies handed to me.  These ranged from "we can't ship product until you fix this" to "you know, we're putting these cover sheets on the TPS reports now."  I'm not happy with
the work I /did/ get done today, which only amounted to about three hours, tops.  I'm hoping that, come morning, I won't want to toss it.<br/><br/>I need to start using Class::DBI.  It's just one of those stupid situations where I feel like I'm being pressured to fix holes rather than replace the lousy dike.<br/><br/>I didn't like it would be wise to stop working to eat, but I did take a midday break to shave, which was a bit of a boost.<br/><br/>Gloria was really busy at work, so I didn't talk to her much today, but I did help her get her iPod mini working through her PC's speakers.  I'm glad that worked out!  I remember how slick it was to start using my iPod at work.  iPods are swell.</p>
