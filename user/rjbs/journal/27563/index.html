<p>There is a bar near the intersection of 3rd Street and Adams Street in Bethlehem.  It is called J.P. McGrady's.  They have good burgers, good wings, and a wide variety of beers on tap.  Despite this, tonight I say, "A POX UPON YOU, MCGRADY!"<br/><br/>Gloria, John, and I went there tonight to get dinner.  I figured that I'd just get a burger and drink water.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money, and I was already feeling a little tired.  The waitress told us, though, that there were "dollar domestic drafts."  Awesome!  I wasn't going to pass that up.  John and I drank four pints of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, got some wings, ate some tasty burgers, and we all had a good ol' time.<br/><br/>Then the check came, and it listed an $18 charge for the beer.  When questioned, our waitress said, "Sierra Nevada isn't domestic."  John repeated this statement to her, and she was forced to offer a less insane explanation: "The only dollar domestic beers are Miller, Bud, and [some other revolting beer].  I thought you guys heard me say that.  She had not, of course, said that.<br/><br/>It really ruined the whole good time that we'd had.  Seven dollars isn't going to break me, but it's a decent amount of money.  It would pay for a movie ticket, or lunch at RTM one day this week, or a paperback book, or a pizza, or a number of other things that I would have enjoyed spending it on more than two pints of beer.  In fact, if I'd just gotten water, I would've saved $9, not $7, and nine is almost ten!  It's within one of ten!<br/><br/>I can tell you where I won't be going much for a while! </p>

When something like that happens, I definately call for the manager.



<h2>Waitress should point it out earlier</h2>

When the waitress mentions the $1 "domestic" drafts, and you say "great, I'll have a Sierra Nevada", her tip is on the line if she doesn't point out then and there that Sierra Nevada isn't (their definition of) domestic.

I agree that she should have pointed this out.  In fairness to her, though, there was a delay between her statement and our order while we sent her away so we could pick something.
