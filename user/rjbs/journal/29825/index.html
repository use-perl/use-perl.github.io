<div class="span8">
<p><p>Every time I see a package variable used for configuration, I wince and shake my fist.  Despite this, I have a number of modules that use globally-defined plugins.  Some of these are usually not a big deal, because the modules are almost always going to be used in programs with one object of the class. Module::Starter and Mail::Audit fall into this group.  (I don't really think this is a good excuse, but it's a reasonable explanation.)</p>

<p>Other classes really do suffer from it, like HTML::Widget::Factory and Number::Tolerant.  It limits the way that they can be used in conjunction with other modules.  To be fair, I don't know of a large group of people clamoring to make their Number::Tolerant-based code pieces interoperate, but the widget factory is something we use a good bit at work, and we have some interesting ideas about how to use it to make our lives even easier.  This becomes a problem if every widget factory has to use the same global set of plugins.</p>

<p>The objects produced by the factory work using existing plugins that affect the modules mixed in to the object's class.  Class::Prototype or Class::Classless make it easy to have objects with differing but similar behavior, but they'd make the code more idiosyncratic and would require re-engineering the plugins, or writing an annoying (for me, at least) adapter.</p>

<p>Instead, I'm stealing from Ruby (which, for all I know, already stole the idea).  HTML::Widget::Factory's new method now returns objects in a unique class, derived from HWF and with a set of plugins mixed into it.  Every factory, and all its created objects, also get one more datum: a Package::Reaper.  Package::Reaper is a new part of the Package-Generate distribution, and it makes me happy.  Reapers use the "exists to be destroyed" pattern; when the reaper is destroyed, so is the package it's made to reap. This means that by using Package::Generate and Package::Reaper together, you can approximate the production of lexical, garbage-collected classes.</p>

<p>I'd like to factor this behavior out and mix it in to other modules, but I'm not sure exactly how abstract to make it, yet.  If I decide to tie myself to a few rules, especially regarding how plugins or mixins are added and whether they can be removed, it should be simple.  My current goal is to implement my specific needs in a few modules, then see how I can abstract it out of all of them into a common solution.  That has worked well in the past, so I'm hoping it will again. </p>

<h2>Dynamically selecting combinations of mixins</h2>

Neat -- I'm looking forward to checking this out. I did something vaguely analagous in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-MixinFactory/" title="cpan.org">Class::MixinFactory</a cpan.org>, but didn't even consider the possibility of reaping the classes when they were no longer needed.

Like I said, I'm still in the "feeling things out" phase, but I uploaded a new HTML::Widget::Factory today that uses this pattern.  Check it out!  Also check out Package-Generator.  I'm eager to have more feedback from people who aren't me!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>Maybe you could use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-Trait/" title="cpan.org">Ovid&#8217;s module</a cpan.org>?</p>
