<p><p>I've heard a lot about Perl::Critic, and it has always sounded neat.  Chris
Dolan gave a talk about it at YAPC, and I decided I should give it a go.  I
didn't get around to it until this week.  I went through and installed a
perl-critic.t in all my distributions, then started testing them.  Nearly all
the violations it found were in a few groups.</p>

<p>"Don't use stringy eval!"  Ok, but I'm trying to load a module by name, and I
don't want to use UNIVERSAL::require.  I need to use stringy eval!</p>

<p>"Don't put any code before <code>use strict</code>!"  Ok, that's reasonable.  I'll just
move <code>use strict</code> to the very top of every file.  "Now don't put any code
before the package declaration!"  What?  No, it doesn't matter!  It's lexical
to the file!</p>

<p>The other things it caught were pretty reasonable, and I fixed them.  I just
didn't like the idea of putting <code>no critic</code> comments at places where I wanted
to keep my code the same.  When I looked at the code for policies, I was
surprised at how simple it was.  PPI exposes a really reasonable DOM, and I was
able to code lots of fiddly little policy tweaks for my own use.</p>

<p>I have a few more policies I want to write, but so far I'm pretty happy with
Perl::Critic and my own attempts to train its taste.</p>

<h2>Perl::Critic++</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jk2addict/">jk2addict</a> on 2006-11-10T15:59:24</h3>
I caught the P::C bug about 4 weeks ago.<br><br>One test checks the core modules. In my case, I set severity to 1, and then commented out policies in the rc that I don't agree with.<br><br>My second test file simply uses the RequireTestLabels and RequireRcsKeywords to make sure all of my test files at least meet those two requirements.<br><br>Other than being an anal retentive freakjob, my main goal is to have a set of policies and test coverage in place for Handel 1.0 before others start contributing to the codebase. Then I have something to point to and blame others when coverage or code style starts to suck.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>Perl::Critic's RequireExplicitPackage Policy</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/thaljef/">thaljef</a> on 2006-11-15T08:59:20</h3>
The RequireExplicitPackage policy arose out of some code really bad legacy code that I have at work.  A lot of it was written for Perl 4, and the author's didn't really understand how to use namespaces.  Consider this example:
<p>

In file Foo.pm:<br>
<code>
  sub frobulator{ print shift; }<br>
  our $SHIZZLE = 42;<br>
  <br>
  package Foo;<br>
  <br>
  sub foo { return main::frobulator( @_ ) }<br>
<br>
</code>
<br>
In file my_script.pl:<br>
<code>
  use Foo;<br>
  Foo::foo( $SHIZZLE );
  <br>
</code>
<br>
Since $SHIZZLE and &amp;frobulator are declared before the package statement in Foo.pm, they wind up in the caller's namespace (main).  So Foo::foo will only work if it is loaded by main.  And when my_script starts loading other libraries that might also load Foo, then it become a big steaming pile.</p><p>

I trully hope that sane developers will never encounter this problem.  But I'm frequently surprised how much insanity there is in the world<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
