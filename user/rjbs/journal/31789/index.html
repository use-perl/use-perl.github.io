<p><p>This week, I bought a Canon Elura 100.  I figure that once we've got a screaming baby, we'll want to take lots of video, so that when we have a screaming teenager, we can embarass him or her in front of his friends.  When I unpacked the camera (which is absolutely tiny), I found lots of little scraps of paper.  There was a registration card; a leaflet suggesting, in eleven different languages, that only Canon accessories should be used; a pamphlet explaining how to install the Windows-based video software; a blue-on-white page explaining, in fourteen different languages, how to clean the tape heads; and a 366 page manual, containing 133 pages in each of three languages.</p>

<p>There was no quick start guide.  This thing is clearly way more complicated than almost any other bit of electronics I've bought in the past few years, and I was stuck reading the manual, starting with Chapter 1: Preparation, a ten page, nine-step process of fine black print on thin pages.</p>

<p>I just wanted a big glossy no-language all-infoglyphics page showing me how to plug it in and start doing any one activity that would show me that things were working.  Is that too much?  I guess they couldn't do that, since they didn't ship it with a memory card or tape for taking pictures or video.</p>

<p>Oh well.  Now that I've got it mostly figured out, I'm hoping to start making some movies of our guinea pigs doing guinea pig things.  I get the impression that it's what the internet is really interested in. </p>

<p>Apple does it. All the Linksys gear I bought came with it. Likewise the Thinkpad.</p>
