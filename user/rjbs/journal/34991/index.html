<p><html><p>I mumbled something about Email::Folder hating me, today, but I was too busy to
explain, and I promised that I&#39;d write down my annoyances later.  I&#39;d love to
fix these problems soon, but for now it&#39;s easier to just grumble about them,
and it will make me feel better.</p><p>To print all threads in a maildir, <em>very</em> naively, I might write something like
this:</p><pre>my $maildir = Email::Folder->new('./Maildir/');

while (my $email = $maildir->next_message) {
  my $subject = $email->header('subject');
  next if $subject =~ /^re:/i;
  print "$subject\n";
}
</pre><p>Great!  There are all the non-reply subjects, more or less.  They&#39;re not in
order, though, and I want to see them in order.  Email::Folder&#39;s iterator is
not ordered, and there is no uniform way to request that it be ordered.  To get
messages in order, we&#39;ll need to get them all and then sort.  That&#39;s not such a
bad obstacle, really.</p><pre>my $maildir = Email::Folder->new('./Maildir/');

# the sort isn't interesting
my @emails = sort { ... } $maildir->message;

for my $email (@emails) {
  my $subject = $email->header('subject');
  next if $subject =~ /^re:/i;
  print "$subject\n";
}
</pre><p>Now, the problem here is that we&#39;ve now loaded every email at once.  They&#39;re
loaded as Email::Simple objects, which means the entire message content is
loaded into memory at once, so if I had a huge maildir, I now have a huge perl
process.</p><p>Email::Folder provides a <code>bless_message</code> method, which is used to create the
Email::Simple objects.  Each time the Email::Folder object&#39;s <code>next_message</code>
method is called, the Email::Folder::Reader (subclassed for the storage medium)
gets the message content from the underlying storage and returns it as a
string.  Email::Folder then passes it to <code>bless_message</code>, which by default
passes it to Email::Simple.  It&#39;s being passed around as a string, meaning that
we&#39;re copying the full text of each (possibly huge) message a few times before
returning the object and throwing away the raw string.</p><p>It would be easy to make the Maildir reader return filehandles, but
<code>bless_message</code> also needs to be replaced to handle them.  Then the problem is
that if you try to do this:</p><pre>my $folder = Email::Folder::MessagesFromFH->new('mbox');
</pre><p>...you will be hosed, because you will get a Email::Folder::Mbox, which reads
messages out as strings.  You need to either write a <code>bless_message</code> that
handles strings and filehandles, or you need to override <code>new</code> to prevent
anything that won&#39;t use the right reader.</p><p>All I wanted to do was implement a cooler version of <code>frm</code>!</p><p>Hopefully I will wake up fresh in the morning and feel energized to actually do
something constructive, rather than just whine.</p></html>

Other than the sorting, wouldn't this be pretty much trivial with a bit of grep?  Something like:<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; grep '^Subject: ' $(find Maildir -type f) | grep -v '^Subject: re:'<br><br>Yeah, continuation lines would take a bit more, but mail's easy as long as you don't touch MIME.

My example was *radically* simplified for the point of demonstrating the headache, it was not the entire program I wanted to produce.

Sorry, I was just guessing from what you posted and your description of a "better 'frm'."  But still, so long as you only care about headers, it seems like Email::Foo would be more trouble than it's worth.

You are wrong.<br><br>I don't want to match header-like content in bodies, or in the headers of subparts.  I need to match wrapped headers.  I will need to decode MIME-encoded headers.  I will need to parse RFC822 date fields.<br><br>Email isn't simple.

That said, I just today had to install some code that used your helpful modules in order to make it more simple.  Thanks a whole bunch.  You make email easier.

Thanks! While I am more a maintainer than an author on many or most of the email modules under my name on the CPAN, knowing that they save people work is a nice motivator to keep doing my own work on them.

Just trying to make a helpful suggestion, not question your intelligence or piss in your oatmeal.  Ah, well...

I'm sorry, I don't mean to come off crabby, but "<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2003/08/cant_you_just_redux.html" title="oreillynet.com">Can't You Just?</a oreillynet.com>" is a common refrain around email programming, and basically always leads to horrible problems due to the mistaken belief that email is just some headers and maybe a body.  I have grown bitter and grumpy whenever someone says to use something non-email-specific to do email stuff.<br><br>Maybe this is my brain's way of telling me that I'm done with email and should move on to something that's always fun, like the web.

My bad.  I've spent a bit of time with email (but obviously not as much as you have), which probably made me overconfident.  Plus, for personal projects like this, I have a strong bias toward 80% or 90% solutions.

<p>Anyways, enjoy that always-fun web.  (X|HT)ML seems just the thing to make email look simple.</p>
