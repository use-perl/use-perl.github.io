<p><p>Not the memory in my brain, mind you.  That's pretty lousy.  The RAM that I ordered last week arrived yesterday while I was at work.  The price difference between various vendors was so great that I'd been concerned that things wouldn't work out.  Everything is just fine, now.</p>

<p>Apple had wanted $500 for two gigs (instead of 512 megs).  Crucial had wanted about $360 for two gigs (and I could keep my old 512 megs).  I picked up two one-gig SO-DIMMs from Newegg, where it was only $166.  That means I way paying about a third of Apple's price and ending up with potentially usable-later DIMMs.  (Well, probably not.)</p>

<p>I think I will use the savings to... save!  I might use a tiny bit of the $333 that I didn't spend to upgrade my OmniGraffle license, or to get a headset for my phone.  The rest goes into The House Fund.</p>

<p>For anyone who wants to do what I did, I ordered Patriot PSD21G6672S.  One of Newegg's reviews said it would not run at the advertised 667MHz, but the hardware profile shows otherwise. </p>
