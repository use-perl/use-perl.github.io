<p><p>Are you listening, Apple?  The Airport needs DHCP reservations.</p>

<p>I like my Airport, and I even feel like the cost wasn't so bad.  Sure, it cost more than its direct competitors, but it was absolutely trivia to get running. When I need to update it, it just takes a few seconds in a nice, simple GUI applications.  Other access points are easy, but Airport is effortless.</p>

<p>Well, except for one thing.  Airport takes care of port forwarding for me, which I only use for SubEthaEdit.  To forward ports, I just tell Airport what port should go from outside to an internal IP.  I tell it the IP.</p>

<p>Argh!  I don't want to have to worry about what IP my laptop is on.  I don't want to restart my AirPort every time I want to use SubEthaEdit (because my IP has changed and I'm updating its NAT rules).  I really don't want to use Mac OS's "network locations" crap to get around DHCP at home.</p>

<p>I just want to say: this MAC is my laptop, and should always get this IP, which has port forwarding set up.  That would make my life much, much easier at times when I want to use SubEthaEdit.  In fact, I'd probably use it a lot more! </p>

My laptop has a "home" setting, forcing my address to 10.0.1.201.  Works just fine.  The airport hands out x.2 to x.199, so there'll never be a collision with me.  I can put rules with port forwarding to my laptop.  Yeay.

Isn't that "home" setting a Network Location?  I specifically want to avoid having to tell my laptop to change its location.  That's dumb.  Maybe if it was easy to say "you are at this location when you get this ssid," but even that is dumb.

Yes, I just set a netloc.  But the other advantage is that I can sleep my laptop for 30 seconds (like to change a battery) and when I wake back up, TCP still hasn't complained.  If you're on DHCP'ed address, and you sleep, you wake up wondering what your address is, and you end up with a different one, and all your connections are bad.  Feh!

I agree with merlyn.  I have a Home setting, and an Away setting.<br><br>Home setting is basically the same, just that I use DHCP with static IP.  It would be nicer if I could tell the Home location to inherit all settings from the other except "these."  But it's not a huge deal IMO.<br>

Oh, that all said, it would be nice if you could port-forward to a Bonjour address (e.g., "rjbs.local").
