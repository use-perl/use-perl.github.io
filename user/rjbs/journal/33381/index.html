<p><html><p>I&#39;ve been writing mini-articles about some of 5.10&#39;s new features for ABE.pm, this past week. It&#39;s been fun, and I&#39;ve learned a few things that I didn&#39;t know in the process. The feature that I knew the least before covering it, so far, has been assertions. Assertions let you have code that only runs if some set of assertions are enabled. It&#39;s something like this:</p><pre>sub everything_is_ok : assertion {
  print "Everything is okay!\n";
}

everything_is_ok;

{
  use assertions 'foo';
  everything_is_ok;
}

{
  use assertions 'foo && bar';
  everything_is_ok;
}
</pre><p>If I were to run this program with <code>perl</code>, it would print one line. If I were to run it under <code>perl -A=foo</code>, it would print two. If I were to run it with <code>perl -A=foo,bar</code>, it would print three.</p><p>Because assertions must be specified before compilation, it&#39;s possible to optimize away the sub calls at compile time, so it&#39;s more efficient than just checking, say, <code>$ENV{PERL_ASSERT_FOO}</code>.</p><p>I think it&#39;s a swell idea, but so far a few things have left me underwhelmed.</p><p>First of all, assertions don&#39;t prevent method calls. I&#39;m sure that this would lead me to some profound grief in the future, when I find that a subclass really needs a subclassed assertion and I have to do more than just subclass it. It&#39;s been mentioned that maybe this (and related woes) will be fixed before 5.10.</p><p>The whole interface seems a bit clumsy, though. I had expected it would work like this:</p><pre>sub everything_is_okay : assertion(wtf) { ... } </pre><p>...and then this code would only run when &#34;wtf&#34; exceptions were enabled. I guess the problem with this might be that sometimes you&#39;d want it to run and sometimes not -- that&#39;s why the assertion&#39;s power was moved to the calling block. The thing is, why isn&#39;t the whole block compiled in or not? It would solve the problem of method calls, and it would prevent this problem:</p><pre>sub check_stuff : assertion { ... }

my $code = \&check_stuff;

{
  use assertions 0; # should prevent all assertions
  $code->(); # ... but this will run anyway
}
</pre><p>Further, how weird is this:</p><pre>
{
  use assertions 'debugging';
  my $value = some_assertion;
}</pre><p>If the <code>debugging</code> assertion isn&#39;t on, $value is set to zero. I&#39;d expect a compile-time death, or at least a runtime death, or at <em>least</em> a result of <code>undef</code>.</p><p>The docs for assertions aren&#39;t great, yet, but I hope I can help. What I hope even more is that I can find a simple way to use the existing assertions hooks to write mine like this:</p><pre>sub does_something_fantastic {
  ...
  assuming 'foo && bar' {
    my $object = get_object;
    $object->some_method;
    say "foo and bar must be enabled!";
  };
  ...
}
</pre><p>...but then again, maybe someone will just be able to point out why the implemented way is the One True Way To Do It. </p></p>
