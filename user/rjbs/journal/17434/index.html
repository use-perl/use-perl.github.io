<p>I never liked the web journals I saw people writing, back when they were just emerging as a popular phenomenon.  They looked too goofy and random.  Then mdxi started his, and it looked quite nice and simple, although there was a disturbing amount of orange in it, if I recall correctly.  I took his script, "serv.pl" and hacked it up to meet my expectations, and "debug.pl" was born.<br/><br/>I kept meaning to rewrite it to do even more of what I wanted; I especially wanted to make it not only a journal, but also an "anecdote server."  I wanted a way to write down little stories and file them based on content or date of occurance.  For a while, I thought I'd just wait for the next generation of the software begun in serv.pl, and then I thought I'd just wait for a smaller subset of that.  Finally, I rewrote my script in a nicer OO and modularized style, but I didn't get around to implementing the bits that would actually make the /end result/ better than it had been.<br/><br/>And then I slacked off.<br/><br/>So, about a month ago I started playing with Bryar, and I made Bryar act mostly like debug.pl, and it was easy, so I've decided to move to Bryar and just subclass the things I need changed.  (Or, as I'd say, "fixed.")  I decided the best way to do this was to switch first, so I've done that, and now I'll have to actually work on the problem.<br/><br/>So far, so good.  I've reformatted most of the documents and done a little subclassing of the datasource.  I need to put together a todo and start working my way through it.  Maybe I'll make the todo list a Bryar page, too...</p>
