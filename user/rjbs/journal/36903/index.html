<p><html><p>I really liked &#34;Mexican Radio,&#34; the one hit by one-hit wonder Wall of Voodoo.
I bought their album, Call of the West, in college, and I liked it, and that
was that.  I didn&#39;t know they&#39;d been around before or after that album, and
hadn&#39;t really thought to look into it.</p><p>I should&#39;ve, though.  I mean, did you know that Arrested Development, the hip
hop group that brought us Mr. Wendell and Tennessee are still producing new
music?  I didn&#39;t think so!</p><p>Anyway, it turns out that they did have other material, including an EP with a
cover of Cash&#39;s Ring of Fire.  I found out on Friday when Pandora decided to
play it for me.  Pandora has brought me lots of great music, but
<a href="http://www.pandora.com/music/song/wall+of+voodoo/ring+of+fire">this</a> may be
the best track they&#39;ve brought me so far.</p></html>

<p>Interestingly, I had never heard Mexican Radio until years after I got into Far Side of Crazy.  I prefer the latter.</p>

<p>Are you saying you've not heard of <a href="http://www.stanridgway.com/" title="stanridgway.com">Stan Ridgway</a stanridgway.com> either? His solo success is effectively what happened after Wall Of Voodoo<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Remember the clasic 'Camouflage', along with 'Calling Out to Carol', 'Don't Box Me In' and my favourite 'Can't Complain'? He's still writing and recording, although I haven't heard his more recent stuff.</p>

<h2>All time best cover song</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2008-07-14T16:41:39</h3>
I still have that EP, and the first two LP's (Dark Continent, Call Of The West) on vinyl. "Ring of Fire" is great...towards the end it sounds like a nightmare at a haunted house (IIRC, they started out wanting to do horror film soundtracks). The instrumental "On I-15" and the title track "Call of the West" on the 3rd album are also among my favorites. I saw them once with Stan Ridgeway (opening for The Residents) and (later) once without. Both great shows...

<p>It's a very good cover, but best ever?  So far, my vote goes for Devo's cover of Satisfaction.  "Clearly" better than the original.</p>

Devo?!?! No, best cover of "Satisfaction" is by The Residents. Depending on your definition of "best", of course. (If your definition includes "most guaranteed to clear a room", then The Residents win, hands down).

Interesting/memorable side note: at the above mentioned WOV/Residents concert, there was a couple that sat down in front of us after WOV was done with their set. We heard them expressing relief that although they missed the opening act, at least they got there in time for WOV. We gave them the bad news "uh, sorry...WOV <em>was</em> the opening act!"
