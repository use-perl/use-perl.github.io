<p>Actually, I'm sure Bugzilla is better than some things.  I wrote a ticket tracker at IQE.  I think most small business programmers write a ticket system at some point.  Mine was sort of complicated, in a good way.  If the code hadn't sucked, I'd release it.  I think I'd like to get really good with RT instead, though.<br/><br/>Anyway, I hate Bugzilla.  We use it at work, and it utterly blows.<br/><br/>I wanted to change my normal search for "what should I do?" to exclude blocked bugs.  I can't work on them, so don't show them to me.  Well, none of the search options seemed to make this work.<br/><br/>"where bugs this depends on is equal to ''" eliminated nothing.<br/><br/>"where bugs this depends doesn't contain regex \d" eliminated way too much.<br/><br/>Other likely candidates failed.  Finally, I found the Mozilla IRC channel, where I asked about this.  I was told to make a positive search: "where bugs this depends" contains something, and then mark that boolean condition as "use negation."<br/><br/>"Thanks," I said, "but now I'm just more annoyed that I can't just search normally with the existing tools."<br/><br/>"Well," says the guy, "there's a patch to search for a field being empty, but the right way is to chart the search logic if you are doing fancy stuff, and that means you use the negation feature."<br/><br/>So, in Bugzilla, wanting to know the bugs you can actually work on is "fancy stuff."<br/><br/>FYIQ. </p>

<h2>Mmmm, the taste of Good Hate.</h2>

That's a good hate.  You might like <a href="http://we.hates-software.com/" title="hates-software.com">We.Hates-Software.com</a hates-software.com>, there's lot's of good hate there, too.  Not really a support group, more like a Bit^W<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... um, a complaint session.

Yeah, rjbs.hates-software.com -- except I haven't submitted anything yet.  I need to update my blogging script to auto-submit anything tagged "stupid" and "software."

<h2>write your own queries - its not hard</h2>

when I last used bugzilla at work I spent a day or two building new default pages and replacing the big search/query page with something much simpler (you could still navigate to that page if you needed it iirc, but nobody ever did).<br><br>really there is no excuse for anybody with half an ounce of perl skill to not hack bugzilla into exactly what you need. for that reason I have started a CDBI framework that provides nice standardised OO access to bugzilla, email me if interested as it's not on cpan yet.
