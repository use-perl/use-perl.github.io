<p><html><p>Last night, I dreamed that I quit my job to return to work at my previous employer.  There would be lots of ups and downs to this, the two most important of which would be that I&#39;d be closer to home and that I&#39;d be developing in Visual Studio and its suite of languages.  I got to my office, and it was pretty high-tech.  I don&#39;t remember just why, but the computer was running some evolved version of Windows that looked sort of Blackbox-y.  (I used to run Blackbox on Win32, there.)  My fellow developers and I shared a nice office space.</p><p>As I started working on my first day&#39;s workload, I suddenly realized that when negotiating my return, I failed to discuss my salary.  I didn&#39;t know what I was going to be making there, which meant, of course, that I had no idea if I really wanted to be there.  I informed my boss of this oversight, and then told my old employer that maybe I&#39;d come back, if it turned out that I&#39;d been rehired for an unacceptable sum.  It was awkward.</p><p>So, a note to all job hunters:  you don&#39;t need to ask for the salary range when you sit down in the interview, but you better ask before you accept the job. </p></html>

I usually don't bother with the interview unless my requirements ( location, salary, travel etc ) can be met.

Even in your dreams?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

I've had similar dreams to this.  I think it must reflect some deep-seated fear that you've forgotten something important.</p>
