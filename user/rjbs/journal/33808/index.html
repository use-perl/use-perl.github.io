<p><html><p>It&#39;s pretty rare that my three siblings and I all get together in one place at one time.  Even the last few Christmases haven&#39;t been very successful reunions. Strangely enough, though, everyone was in town this weekend.  Steve was down for a friend&#39;s wedding, Heide and Pete were in town just to visit, and Carmita lives here now.  We all went to Kip and Carmita&#39;s for some food from the grill, some beer from the fridge, and some strife from the kids.  The kids numbered six: Martha, Martha&#39;s cousins Jacob, Anika, and Matthias, and Steve&#39;s girlfriend Connie&#39;s kids Peter and Francesca.  There was some pushing, yelling, and fighting amongst the kids (except for Martha and Matthias), but for the most part everything was just fine.</p><p>I apparently became Coolest Guy in the World (for a day) by having a Lego Jango Fett and giving it to Peter.  He&#39;d been bugging Steve about it for a week or more, and Steve was floored when Peter bugged me and I said, &#34;Oh, yeah, I have one.&#34;</p><p>I brought the beer for the event.  Gloria and I went over to Tanczos (the local beer distributor that I favor) and I saw that they had Victory&#39;s Prima Pils for cheap.  I got a case for about $25 plus tax.  I really like Prima Pils, and I think it may be my new everyday beer.  (I only buy beer once every few months, so &#34;everyday&#34; is sort of a misnomer.)  It&#39;s an interesting beer.  Kip and Steve and I were discussing its merits for a while, and I think the conclusion was that it was a good ale drinker&#39;s pilsner.  It&#39;s got a lot of the flavors of a pilsner, but it&#39;s lacking in two areas: its taste isn&#39;t the crisp, clean set of distinct flavors you&#39;d expect from a German pilsner; and it&#39;s not as highly carbonated as most pilsners.  Still, as an ale drinker, I like it.  I think its muddied flavors end up making it match with more things.  It&#39;s hoppy, but not as aggressive as some of Victory&#39;s other beers.</p><p>In short:  if you&#39;ve got it available, try it.</p><p>It was pretty cool to just sit around, drink a beer, eat some chicken, and watch the kids run around.  They also &#34;put on a show&#34; for us, which basically meant that we all sat in a semicircle and watched them perform a series of fundamentaly unconnected actions.  This was just fine, too.  It&#39;s great that Carmita has moved back to Bethlehem.  I&#39;m hoping Steve and Heide will end up doing so, too, in the next few years. </p></html>
