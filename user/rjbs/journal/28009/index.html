<p>http://search.cpan.org/uploads.rdf<br/><br/>I noticed a while ago that the CPAN's feed had stopped uploading.  Most of my ability to write useful code hinges on the fact that I know the CPAN's contents pretty well, and keep up to date on it.  The loss of this feed did not bode well for me.<br/><br/>Randal pointed me to another feed, but it sucked: its links were not to the dist pages, but to downloads.<br/><br/>I just went to the CPAN search page and found a new feed.  Not only is it up to date, but its creator field is populated, and it has the dist's abstract.  I wish this had been announced somewhere -- like maybe in the old feed! </p>

Wow, you're right.  That'll teach me not to actually go to the site when things break. {grin}

The mailing list sending out the top stories on<br>this site has the distributions uploaded to CPAN<br>for the previous day included.<br><br>Seeing as there are not so many top stories,<br>usually it has only the distributions.<br><br>And there are links to the CPAN pages.
