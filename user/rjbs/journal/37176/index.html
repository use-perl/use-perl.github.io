<p><html><p>Ugh!  Remember that dream I had about going to work at a Windows shop?  I don&#39;t know, man.  I don&#39;t know.</p><p>I&#39;m working on a project that has me writing some code in a few different languages.  Earlier this week I was suffering the slings and arrows of outrageous PHP.  It seemed only fair to write a library in C# while I was at it.  Tom told me that I could get a free version of Visual Studio to do this, so I gave it a go.</p><p>First I booted up my trusty old Parallels virt for Windows XP.  It wanted SP3 to be installed, so I told it to go ahead.  Unfortunately, it kept failing with no reason.  This was familiar:  there was an old security update that kept failing.  Here&#39;s the advice from Microsoft Update in case of upgrade failure:</p><blockquote><p>Problem: A problem on your computer is preventing updates from being &#62; downloaded or installed Solution: To fix the problem, try installing the &#62; updates again. If that doesn&#39;t work, use the Troubleshooter to try solve the &#62; problem.</p></blockquote><p>What&#39;s that saying?  The definition of insanity is trying the same thing and expecting different results?</p><p>Well, I tried it over and over, and I did, indeed, go insane.  I got better.</p><p>So I went through the Troublehsooter, which was totally worthless, except that by following all the links that I was discouraged from following, I finally found an SP3 standalone installer download &#34;only for IT professionals planning to deploy SP3 via automated blah blah blah.&#34;</p><p>I ran that, it churned and showed some progress bars and finally said, &#34;You don&#39;t have enough space to back up files needed for uninstall.&#34;</p><p>Oh!  Well that&#39;s fine!  I can make more room.</p><p>I added more storage to my virt and installed the update.  I had very little space left, though, and even after some cleaning wasn&#39;t happy with the space left.  Worse, though, was the performance.  I basically must not have Firefox and Parallels running at the same time (at least not running Windows).  I&#39;ve heard many times that VMWare Fusion is better-performing than Parallels, though, so I gave it a go.  It installed XP handily and I installed SP3 with no problem.  I installed Visual Studio 2008 Express C# Edition, Strawberry Perl, Firefox, and AWG for virus scanning.  I went back to MS Update and there were 17 more updates to install.  No problem... just kidding.</p><blockquote><p>Problem: A problem on your computer is preventing updates from being &#62; downloaded or installed Solution: To fix the problem, try installing the &#62; updates again. If that doesn&#39;t work, use the Troubleshooter to try solve the &#62; problem.</p></blockquote><p>Argh!  Is it the virus scanner?  I &#34;paused&#34; it, but no help there.  I shut it down.  No help.  I uninstalled it, and still no help.</p><p>I had gigs free.  I&#39;d check the logs, but there really aren&#39;t any useful logs to look at.  I can&#39;t really strace or dtruss the installer.  I resort to the tool of the clueless:  Google.</p><p><a href="http://www.technipages.com/error-a-problem-on-your-computer-is-preventing-updates-from-being-downloaded.html">Eureka!</a></p><p>There was nothing to it.  I just needed to re-register a few core Windows Update dynamic libraries with the system via the command line.  I guess any non-technical user would&#39;ve just intuited this on his own, and my own technical background blinded me to its obviousness.</p><p>Fusion sure is performing better than Parallels, though.  Maybe I&#39;ll buy it. </p></html>

I recently had to install XP on WMWare too and I was stuck with the same problem. Not really stuck, since I just ignored it and did what I needed to do, but the updates wouldn't install. So I guess you need to read use.perl for Windows help. Go figure.
