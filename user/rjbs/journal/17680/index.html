Most people think you're ineffective, but you are trying to completely save the world from itself, so there's always going to be a long way to go. ÃÂ You're always the one trying to get friends to talk to each other, enemies to talk to each other, anyone who can to just talk instead of beating each other about the head and torso. ÃÂ Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, and you get very schizophrenic as a result. ÃÂ But your heart is in the right place, and sometimes also in New York.

<p>You're Switzerland! While most people think you're sort of stuck up, it's really just that people don't interest you that much. </p>

<p>LOL...that must be why I've always had a swiss dog<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
