<div class="span8">
<p>I've got nothing much to report: life continues on, and is pretty much unexciting and acceptable.<br/><br/>I just left the book club; tonight we were discussing the first book I've suggested, "Augustine of Hippo" by Peter Brown.  I read it twice in college, and I really enjoyed it both times.  I reread a little more than half of it before the meeting, and it was still a very enjoyable book.  It was a little longer than most of our books (about 450 dense pages), and no one had finished it.  A fair number of people, in fact, hadn't even started it.<br/><br/>I was a little disheartened, but not surprised; this meeting had been pushed back to allow more people to finish (and start) the book, and some people complained that it was too long, or that it was a "Jesus book."  In reality, though, I think it went pretty well.  Everyone who had read some of the book seemed to have found it interesting.  Jennifer thought that Brown was a bad writer, but I only agreed with one part of that: he used, way too, many commas.<br/><br/>I suppose that the better drop-in replacement for Augustine of Hippo might have been Augustine's own Confesions, but I think that I assumed, at the time, that everyone would have read it already.  I don't know why I would have thought that.<br/><br/>I think the discussion went well, at any rate.<br/><br/>Paul made a lot of tasty food, and I ate too much today.  Fortunately I was forward-thinking and had a salad for lunch.  It was a salade Nicoise, one of my favorite kinds of salads.  To its credit, it contained anchovies, which I've seen left out of American salad Nicoise before; to its detriment, the tuna in it was far too cooked, as if it had come from a can.<br/><br/>Louis gave his suggestions this evening, and for the meeting after next we will be reading The Spy Who Came in From the Cold.  I am expecting great things. For the next meeting we're reading Steven's suggestion, The Amulet of Samarkand.  I am keeping my expectations low, for that, for now.  I may well be pleasantly surprised, though!<br/><br/>Work was not very productive today, although I think I closed a number of little bugs that needed closing.  This weekend I continued my war on Bugzilla, and made a few little changes that may help it become yet more useful.  The one change I wasn't able to complete was the creation of a little Subversion/Bugzilla bridge.  Because of the complexities of our Perl environment, I couldn't just do it.  Bugzilla's own uglieness didn't help.  Is it too much to ask to think that one could, roughly, write: Bug->get(123)->add_comment($string) ?<br/><br/>I also encountered some annoyances, unrelated to Bugzilla, with superclass methods.  Simon suggested SUPER.pm would solve my problems, but at first pass it didn't.  That's not a big deal, because I can accomplish what I wanted to accomplish, slightly less correctly, using a simpler method.  I feel like I'm making good, steady progress on making Listbox better, which is a continual source of satisfaction.<br/><br/>I complained, the other day, about the death of the filesystem on my external firewire drive.  I downloaded a program called Data Rescue II, which someone suggested would help.  Lo and behold, it listed the contents of the filesystem and tempted me to restore files -- but then said I'd need to pay $99 if I wanted more than a single five megabyte file.  It just wasn't worth that much to me, so I was about to quit, when I noticed that the drive had now become mounted.  I think this was probably a coincidence, but frankly I didn't care. I copied nearly everything from the drive (one or two files gave i/o errors) and build a new filesystem.  Time will tell whether this was a hardware or software failure.<br/><br/>I'm having another weird failure, this one on cheshire.  Once I offloaded a the bulk of my recovered data to that machine, I realized that I had very little free space left: just about three gigs, out of one hundred.  The annoying truth is that I had about fifteen gigs free, in other partitions, but I didn't have enough space to actually reorganize my data to make that space useful.  I thought that my external USB enclosure contained a 120 gig drive, which would have made it simple to reorganize by cannibalizing it.  Unfortunately, once I opened it up I found that it was just an eighty gigger.  Rather than spend a long time solving the Towers of Hanoi with cpio and fdisk, I gave in and finally ordered new drives.<br/><br/>For a long time I've been thinking about getting new storage; my initial plan with cheshire was to build a RAID5, but I settled on a plain old SLED setup, and it never really caused my any grief.  I thought that I'd wait until I could do that, this time, but prices still aren't where I want them to be, and I've got better things to use money toward than self-indulgent hardware purchases. I didn't even bother with SATA, because I knew it would be an annoyance to set up a new kernel, and that I'd probably end up feeling rushed to upgrade to a 2.6 kernel.  Instead, I ordered two 250 GB drives from Seagate, for just over $200.  Once they arrive, I'll set them up with LVM and a RAID1, and that should last me for a good long time.  I'm excited about doing something new with cheshire; it's been unchanged for ages, now.  That's mostly a nice thing, but doing different things is good for me.<br/><br/>When I got to work, today, I tried to compile a kernel with RAID1 and LVM support, but the kernel compile kept dying.  Rather than try to solve it while at work, I put it aside for now.  I'll look at it Tuesday or Wednesday, or maybe on Thursday night while Gloria's teaching.<br/><br/>I'm even thinking about totally rebuilding cheshire with the newest Slackware, to clear out any accumulated cruft.  I might even switch to Postfix (from qmail) and some sort of lightweight httpd (from Apache); the only issue with leaving Apache is that I've grown to really like mod_svn for Subversion access.<br/><br/>Mostly I'm just looking forward to reorganizing my drives to make more sense. </p>

<p>Out of curiousity, what was <code>SUPER</code> not doing for you?  Theory once asked if it could dispatch to a given parent class (skipping one, for example), but I never added that.</p>

I was trying to do this, very roughly:<blockquote> <div><tt>for my $field (@fields) {<br>&nbsp; my $code = sub {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $self = shift;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $value = $self-&gt;super($self, @_);<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return $value if defined $value;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $self-&gt;default_list-&gt;$field;<br>&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; Sub::Install::install_sub({ code =&gt; $code, as =&gt; $field });<br>}</tt></div> </blockquote>I don't remember the failure I experienced off hand, but I'll try writing it again today and see if it turns out to work.

<p>Depending on how rough that code is, you have an extra <code>$self</code> in there, which probably changes things.</p>

Heh, fortunately that code was just typed off the cuff.  The real code -- probably -- did not have that particular problem.<br><br>Unfortunately, due to other issues in the module I was extending, I ended up having to do something more complex.  I hope to have a reason to play with SUPER sometime in the future!
