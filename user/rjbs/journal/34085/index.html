<div class="span8">
<p><html><p>I used to keep a lot of personal stuff in <code>~/svn</code>, like my RPG notes, dotfiles
for various apps, and some of the stupid little things I stick in <code>~/bin</code>.  I
converted that to git about a month ago, and it went just fine.  A little
later, John and I decided we&#39;d switch svn.codesimply.com to git, and I ran into
an annoying problem.</p><p>When we first created that repository (or converted things to it), we had
everything organized like this:</p><pre>/exporter/trunk
/exporter/branches
/exporter/tags
/rubric/trunk
/rubric/branches
/rubric/tags
</pre><p>This was mildly annoying, since <code>git-svnimport</code> expects one Subversion
repository per project, with the trunk/branches/tags structure at the top
level.  Converting these wasn&#39;t hard, though, with commands looking something
like this:</p><pre>git svnimport -A authors -i -C git/$project
  -t projects/$project/tags
  -T projects/$project/trunk
  file:///Users/rjbs/vcs/svn/
</pre><p>(I didn&#39;t import branches, as I think only one or two projects had ever
branched, and not very interestingly.)  The larger problem was that many
projects had been renamed.  For example, <code>exporter</code> had been renamed to
<code>Sub-Exporter</code> and <code>rubric</code> to <code>Rubric</code>.  I was baffled about how to deal with
this problem.  Importing everything from the old name and then from the new
name didn&#39;t preserve the history, because somewhere in there a transaction
would delete all the old files and create new ones.</p><p>I asked around for help, posting to the git list, asking on #git, and poking at
people I knew who had a clue.  None of this helped very much, although
<a href="http://sam.vilain.net/">mugwump</a> suggested <code>git-filter-branch</code>, and
<a href="http://perldition.org/">rafl</a> suggested a similar tool in cogito.  Then rafl
gave me a link to <a href="http://www.ouaza.com/wp/2007/07/28/assembling-bits-of-history-with-git-take-two/">an article about this
problem</a>,
which looked quite relevant.  The problem was that it was not a 100% step by
step solution, and I was really not interested in spending much brainpower
thinking about how to apply that solution to my problem.  Switching to git is,
for me, a way to get a better tool, and not something I wanted to spend any
real brain time on.</p><p>&#34;Good grief,&#34; I thought to myself, &#34;all I really want to do is import the two
sets of changes, skipping the one stupid renaming transaction!  Is that so
hard?&#34;  Of course, as is often the case, yelling my problems out loud made me
realize how easy they would be to resolve.</p><p>Almost all of the renaming occurred in a block of transactions spanning, let&#39;s
say, 100 to 120.  I just had to run this for each project:</p><pre>git svnimport -A authors -i -C git/$new_name
  -t projects/$old_name/tags
  -T projects/$old_name/trunk
  -l 99
  file:///Users/rjbs/vcs/svn/

git svnimport -A authors -i -C git/$new_name
  -t projects/$new_name/tags
  -T projects/$new_name/trunk
  -s 121
  file:///Users/rjbs/vcs/svn/
</pre><p>It imported all the history up to the rename, from the old names.  Then,
picking up after the rename, it imported all the new history.  For a few
projects, which were renamed later (due to mistakes during The Great Renaming),
I reran the script with alternate values for <code>-l</code> and <code>-s</code>.  It was really
easy.</p><p>I&#39;ve gotten everything converted now, save for Mixin-ExtraFields-Param and a
few Kwiki plugins.  I think the plugins will be no problem, but MEP has been
givng me grief.  If I can&#39;t make it just work today, I&#39;ll import it without
history, and then I&#39;ll be done!</p><p>Starting a read-only git daemon was really easy.  I made a new service for
daemontools to run, and it has a one-line definition.  I&#39;ll probably install
gitweb later, but for now I&#39;m ready to start doing all my codesimply coding,
simply, with git.</p></html>
