<p><html><p>Bryan posted <a href="http://mirrorshades.org/overflow/2008/08/itunes_top_25_most_played.shtml">his most played
tracks</a>
to his blog.  I used to publish a daily log of what tracks I&#39;d played in
iTunes, but its records bugged me and I gave up on it.  Still, it seemed like
very slightly entertaining information to share.  For example, Bryan listened
to The District Sleeps Alone about three times as often as the next contender.
Either he needs to obsess less or use smart playlists more!</p><p>See?  Now if I share this data, you will be able to give me a hard time.  So,

<p>At the risk of starting<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... something, why not use last.fm for this kind of data capture? you even have an account there<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I haven't found anything that tolerably will update last.fm with things from both iTunes, which I listen to occasionally, AND my iPhone/iPod, which I listen to constantly.  The one I had found, ScrobblePod, was awful.</p>

<p>the last.fm desktop software itself, in theory, can do that now. I haven't tried because until recently I was running mobilescrobbler on my iphone. Moving to the 2.x firmware lost that for me but I will be giving the last.fm iphone sync a try soon.</p>
