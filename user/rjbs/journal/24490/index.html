<p>Doctor Girlfriend died today at exactly one o'clock.<br/><br/>He hadn't been eating much for the last few days, and by last night was basically ignoring all his food, even when hand-fed to him.  This morning, Gloria took him in to the vet.  Pigs are pigs, and should act like it, eating whenever they can; this was very strange.<br/><br/>The vet did an x-ray, and found a large calcium deposit in his urinary tract. His bladder was distended, and he clearly hadn't been able to pass anything in a while.  This was making him nervous and very uncomfortable.  An operation was possible, but very expensive, and especially risky because of his young age.<br/><br/>My friend Jeff from work gave me a lift to the animal hospital.  Doctor Girlfriend got a small injection, and Gloria and I sat with him as he went to sleep.  It was very fast. </p>
