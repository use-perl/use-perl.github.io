<p><html><p>My <a href="http://rjbs.manxome.org/rubric/entry/1648">previous complaint</a> is really
not a big deal, I think.  I think I&#39;ve even given up immediate junking for
that.  However...</p><p>&#34;Send your resume&#34; doesn&#39;t mean &#34;apologize for having no resume.&#34;  You could
make a half-assed resume in the time it takes to write a half-assed apology,
and you could write a decent resume in only a little bit longer.</p><p>&#34;Send your resume in plaintext&#34; doesn&#39;t mean &#34;as a Word document&#34; or &#34;as a link
to a Google Apps document.&#34;  Doing those things means, &#34;I didn&#39;t read your
whole job posting, so who knows if I know what the job even is.  Oh, or maybe I
just can&#39;t follow instructions.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Send your resume in plaintext to jobs@example.com&#34; means to do that, not to
reply in any other way that doesn&#39;t get routed directly to my inbox.</p><p>You don&#39;t know who reads the resume you send in.  Please do not say, &#34;Dear HR
Recruiter.&#34;  It insults me.</p><p>Including an &#34;objective&#34; section on your resume is fine.  I don&#39;t mind them.
If your objective is at odds with the posting (&#34;objective: obtain a career as a
Java programmer&#34;) you will not get hired.  Of course, since getting this job is
not your objective, maybe you don&#39;t care.</p><p>Attaching your resume is great.  Give it a name like ~Ricardo-Signes.txt<code>.
Otherwise, when I try to save it to</code>~/Hiring`, I&#39;ll get a message that says
&#34;Overwrite, append, or cancel?&#34;  Guess which one I&#39;ll pick.</p><p>So, if you&#39;re in the Philadelphia area and can follow instructions and want to
work at the coolest email company on the internet, we&#39;re hiring a <a href="http://philadelphia.craigslist.org/sad/792369480.html">junior sysadmin</a> and a <a href="http://philadelphia.craigslist.org/eng/792365652.html">junior programmer</a>.</p></html>

<h2>I resisted the urge to apply via comments</h2>

<p>... apologizing for not having an updated resume, saying I wanted to telecommute from half a continent away, and so forth.</p><p>But I couldn't figure out how to attach a Word document via slashcode, so I didn't.</p>



<h2>Dear foo ...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/parv/">parv</a> on 2008-08-14T03:01:46</h3>
<p>Say, if the applicant does not know the name (of the person) reading the resume (or finally responsible for hiring), what should the salutation be if not "(HR Manager|Director)|Prospective Employer"? "To whom it may concern"?</p><p>There are many situations when a name is not easy to come by: only an URL given; name cannot be deducted from an email address reliably everytime; phone call would be impossible due to time zone difference.</p>

<p>I would go with "To whom it may concern."  Also totally acceptable is "Hiring manager."</p><p>I'm probably not the best person to ask.  I still get annoyed when I get mail from strangers that begins "Dear Mr. Signes" or "Dear Ricardo."  If you don't know me, I am not dear to you!</p><p>GET OFFA MY LAWN</p>
