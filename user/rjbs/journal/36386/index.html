<p><html><p>Here&#39;s an idea that occurs to me frequently when making slides for conference
tutorials.  Sometimes I make a slide and I know that it might be too advanced,
but it&#39;s a crap shoot.  If the vast majority of the audience understands the
slide, I can save several slides by not explaining it.  If enough people look
confused, I want to display those slides.  I don&#39;t mind making the slides up
front, but I&#39;d like to be able to only show them if I think it&#39;s needed.</p><p>I wonder if there&#39;s some way to make good Keynote triggers that would let me
say something like: &#34;if you want to explain why <code>1 + 1 = 1</code>, press F1;
otherwise, press Next.&#34;</p><p>Choose your own slideshow.</p><p>I also wonder whether the Visor program that I saw ages ago is triggerable
during a slide show.  It looks good, and it would be convenient to keep a
giant-font terminal ready to slide down to demonstrate answers to hard
questions.</p></html>

<h2>&quot;Choose your own slideshow&quot; + Visor</h2>

<p> <i>I wonder if there's some way to make good Keynote triggers that would let me say something like: "if you want to explain why 1 + 1 = 1, press F1; otherwise, press Next."</i> </p>

<p>I do "choose your own slideshow" all the time.  My presentations are mostly project status type stuff, and if I don't know exactly who is going to be in the room for the presentation, I'll include slides that have technical detail that I can skip over if the audience is not very technical (or doesn't seem interested in the detail.)</p>

<p>The way I do it is to just put the detailed slides after the summary slide.  So for example, if I slide #9 has two additional detail slides, I'll put them as slides 10 and 11.  Then at the bottom of slide #9, I make two hyperlinks (put in some text, select it, and choose Inspector -&gt; Hyperlink Inspector -&gt; Enable as Hyperlink).  The "we're not interested in the technobabble" link gets linked to slide 12, the "yes please, more geekery" link gets linked to slide 10.</p>

<p> <i>I also wonder whether the Visor program that I saw ages ago is triggerable during a slide show.</i> </p>

<p>I haven't found any way to get it to work, since keynote takes over the whole screen.  What I do instead is use the 'Window Groups' feature in the Leopard version of Terminal to create a window group that has one window that is the full screen size with a really big font (so that I don't have to set it up every time).  Then I run that at the same time as the presentation and just cmd-tab between them.</p>
