<p>I made my first entry on use.perl today, despite my normal dislike of having
journals other than the one on manxome.  I figured there had to be some kind of
Perl module to post to use.perl, and waltman pointed it out to me.  I think
I've got a crappy little script that will find perl-related entries here and
post them to use.perl.  I'll find out shortly.<br/><br/>I wrote myself a message at work on my biggest whiteboard in big letters: JFDI.
The more I try to JFDI, the more I actually do get things done, so it's
encouraging.  I need to plan less and do more.  I get too bogged down in
"what-ifs" and I end up never creating stuff for fear that it will suck.  More
and more, as I try to get things done, I find myself quoting the Pragmatic
Programmer in my head.  "Pragmatic programmers fire tracer bullets."<br/><br/>My personal take on this, lately, has been, "Pragmatic programmers write bad
code and fix it later."  (Kinda.)  Test::More is, really, a godsend for mixing
JFDI with quality.  I write the freaking tests, implement the freaking code,
and I get some decent stuff done.  Later, I can extend both to keep making them
better.  I feel like I need to share this discovery with everyone, but sadly
most of the people I know already know or don't get it.<br/><br/>Hopefully I'll be successful in demonstrating its awesomeness to my
Perl-learning co-workers in Cardiff when I'm over there next month.  Showing is
better than telling.<br/><br/>As mentioned elsewhere, I'm making my first attempts to see if I can start a
local Perl Mongers.  It's hard to have zero local people off of whom to bounce
ideas, or even with whom to socialize.  I like non-geeks plenty, but everyone
likes to have friends of his own ilk.
