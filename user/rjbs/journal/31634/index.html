<p><p>Today, the weather was crap.  It was extremely windy and rainy.  In the afternoon, I started to hear a weird noise coming from outside, like the kind of fake thunder you make by shaking a sheet of aluminum.  It turns out that the flashing from around the third floor roof came loose and was shaking around like crazy, barely dangling off the house.  Just as we came back from the grocery, it came off and fell to the ground.  There are now a few pieces of aluminum sitting on my rear porch.</p>

<p>I sure hope the roofers call to schedule their work soon. </p>

<h2>Welcome to home ownership!</h2>

<p>I've been in my new house for about one and half years.  All sorts of crazy stuff happens.  This spring, a flash downpour overwhelmed all the downspouts/drains, backing them up and causing flooding in the cellar from the laundry machine drainpipe.  The more stuff happens, the more I get used to it and no longer wonder just what I was thinking buying a house.  Hang in there.</p>



<h2>Owning a home can suck</h2>

I have lived in this house for about a year and half and it was about 12 years old when I bought it.<br><br>There are definate issues with the electricity.<br><br>There is mold in the basement which means all the carpets will have to be replaced and basically the entire thing re-finished.<br><br>A week and a half ago the exact same thing happened to me (flashing) except that it was only about a 12-15 foot length and I climbed up on the second story roof and nailed it back in place myself.<br><br>Last night we had hard rain and a driving wind.  The two front window overhangs apparently need calking because water started dripping into the house.  One place was my 9 month old daughter's playroom.  The second was on the table where my wife's very expensive digital camera and camcorder sat.  Fortunately both were ok and Jasmine was able to continue playing in the playroom due to some ingenuity on our parts - but grrrr.<br><br>Tomorrow I will be buying some calking to seal the overhangs.<br><br>NOT what I wanted to do on my bday weekend.
