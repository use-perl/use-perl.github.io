<p><html><p>I&#39;m playing Mass Effect now.  It&#39;s pretty good, although I&#39;m starting to find
it a bit tedious, mostly because I keep having to repeat the same bits.  This
is especially frustrating when I have several dialog options that look very
similar but end up coming out of my mouth with very different tones of voice.</p><p>That&#39;s a problem specific to Mass Effect, and it has some others.  The thing
that annoys me the most, though, is that it suffers particularly badly from a
case of Stupid Game Economy.  I wrote about the <a href="http://rjbs.manxome.org/rubric/entry/1381">stupid Cyberpunk
2020</a> economy before, and it&#39;s a
problem you can find all over the place if you look.</p><p>Mass Effect is a space opera.  It has laser guns, super armor, space grenades,
and holographic healing gauntlets.  You start out with some of these, but
they&#39;re bottom of the barrel and you have to acquire better ones as you play.
You acquire these, sometimes, as spoils of war, but a lot of the really good
stuff needs to be purchased.  For example, some of the best weapons and armor I
can get right now sell for six figures.</p><p>It not easy for me to acquire that kind of capital.  It might be impossible
without hours and hours more gameplay to even get close to it.</p><p>A minor upgrade to one of my weapons costs maybe 3000 credits.  A license to
preach on the main space station&#39;s promenade costs 150 credits.</p><p>So, let&#39;s say these are dollars.  One hundred fifty dollars for a license from
the government is not insane.  Three thousand dollars for a pretty nice gun is
not insane.  One hundred thousand dollars for a really badass shield
generator... well, let&#39;s say it&#39;s sane.  Let&#39;s say all the prices make sense.</p><p>I ran a smuggling job for an alien.  I used my status as a Spectre to bring
experimental weapons into a tightly-controlled facility for him to resell.  For
my trouble, he gave me $250.  I broke into an office complex and murdered
something like twenty (corrupt) law enforcement officers.  The guy who hired me
to do that gave me about $700.  What the hell is going on here?</p><p>Oh, so I mentioned I&#39;m a Spectre?  A Spectre is a super-elite ultra-secret
agent who reports directly to the triumvirate that rules the galaxy.  I&#39;ve been
sent to capture a rogue agent.  They sent me as an alternative to sending an
entire <em>fleet</em>.  &#34;Here,&#34; they said, &#34;have a starship.&#34;</p><p>Not pictured, of course, is the conversation where I say, &#34;Wow, thanks, that&#39;s
a fantastic starship, and I know it&#39;s the best one in the whole human fleet.
Do you think I could get some better kit for my team, too?  Maybe one of those
Ripper IV assault rifles and some shield generators?&#34;  The Council of Galactic
Omnipotence then says, &#34;Sorry, no.  We know your mission is going to prevent
the destruction of all life int he galaxy, but... we want you to <em>work</em> for
it.&#34;</p><p>This is present in any game where the hero is known by all to be, you know, a
<em>hero</em> saving the world from destruction, but he still has to pay for a glass
of milk to heal.</p><p>&#34;I need an ice hammer.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Sure thing, Hero of Eternity.  That&#39;ll be 350 gilootnis.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Um... I need the hammer to get into the mountains to defeat the dragon that&#39;s
been attacking your village.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Yeah, I heard.  Thanks!&#34;</p><p>&#34;So, really, can&#39;t you just give me the hammer?  Or loan it to me?  I&#39;m trying
to save you and, you know, your family.  The Great Deity Thrumboat didn&#39;t give
me a budget or anything when he imbued me with the Master Spirit so I could
save you.  I guess he figured people would be reasonable and want to contribute
to their own salvation.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Ho!  That Thrumboat!  Always figuring.&#34;</p><p>&#34;...&#34;</p><p>&#34;Yeah, seriously though, tree fiddy.&#34;</p></html>

<p>I'm playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_2" title="wikipedia.org">Sacred 2: Fallen Angel</a wikipedia.org> at the moment, and it's almost the opposite problem. I'm a millionaire and can't spend my money fast enough. Maybe I shouldn't be playing on EASY, though....<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:x
What I find bizarre about games like that, or Oblivion for example, is that you can walk around stealing gold from everywhere. Like, I go into a vendor's place, and I take some gold, or I get some potions or whatever and go sell it to him.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p><p> <small>slanning --who tends to play as girly archers</small> </p>
