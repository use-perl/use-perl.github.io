<p><p>Why is AppleScript so slow?  Whenever I try to do a bunch of things repeated
tasks with it, it feels like it takes forever.  I assume it isn't really
AppleScript per se, but the underlying Apple Events layer.  When I've used
Mac::Glue, it's been about as slow.</p>

<p>I wanted to re-name a bunch of mp3 files, last night.  Actually, I didn't want
to rename the files, I just wanted to get their ID3 tags set properly.  First,
I worked with their track numbers.  I had the files in a play list in order, so
I wanted to iterate over them, giving them sequential track numbers.  First, I
tried iterating over <code>selection</code>, but it seems like the <code>repeat with</code> loop gets
confused if the list changes as it works.  I got things working quickly,
though.</p>

<p>tell application "iTunes"
    set num to 1
    set song_list to selection</p>

<pre><code>repeat with song in song_list
  set track number of song to num
  set num to num + 1
end repeat
</code></pre>

<p>end tell</p>

<p>In my first pass, I used <code>songs</code> instead of <code>song_list</code>.  It turns out that
it's an iTunes object.  I don't know what.  It's not in the dictionary.  I
don't know enough to inspect the object further.  You can just tell iTunes to
<code>get songs</code>, though, and you'll get back "songs."  Huh.</p>

<p>Some of the files I was working with were named like this:</p>

<p>02 - Your Favorite Song</p>

<p>To get rid of the now-fixed track number, I did something else very simple.</p>

<p>tell application "iTunes"
    repeat with song in selection
      set song<em>title to name of song
      set title</em>length to length of song<em>title
      set fixed</em>name to text 6 thru title<em>length of song</em>title
      set name of song to fixed_name
    end repeat
  end tell</p>

<p>Other tracks were more like this:</p>

<p>Your Favorite Band - Their Best Album - 01 - Stupid Spoken Intro</p>

<p>So fixing the titles was simple:</p>

<p>set the text item delimiters to " - "
  tell application "iTunes"
    set song_list to selection</p>

<pre><code>repeat with song in song_list
  set title to name of song
  get text items of title
  set name of song to text item 4 of title
end repeat
</code></pre>

<p>end tell</p>

<p>Yeah, I could've done something like that to get all the data, but by the time
I got to this stage, I'd fixed everything else.  This script seemed to update
files at a rate of about one file ever three or four seconds.   Often, when I have to sit through this kind of delay, a modal dialog box pops up with no caption and no status bar.  It tends to appear and disappear just frequently enough to keep me from doing anything useful.</p>

<p>AppleScript continues to be extremely useful and extremely annoying.  I like
Mac::Glue a lot, but I feel like it's often faster to struggle through
AppleScript.  That's probably because it has the dictionary browser, a
compiler that catches a lot of simple problems, and a lot of ways to get
instant feedback.</p>

<p>I just wish it ran faster.</p>

Except it is "Apple events," not "Apple Events."  "Event" in this context is capitalized only when part of a proper name like "Apple Event Manager."  FWIW.<br><br>And it's not so much Apple events, but the iTunes Apple events implementation.  It's slow.  Always has been.  Dunno why.<br><br>Also, I still use AppleScript sometimes for prototyping.  And I sometimes use the AppleScript dictionary in Script Editor for my Mac::Glue coding.<br>
