<p><html><p>Sprint PCS was my very first cell phone provider.  Shortly after we moved back to Pennsylvania, though, I got rid of them and switched to VoiceStream.  With some brief outages (while using awful Nextel phones at IQE), I&#39;ve been with VoiceStream (now T-Mobile) since then.</p><p>When I started working at Pobox, I began making a two hour commute, two ways, three times a week.  That&#39;s twelve hours on the bus, and I wanted to be able to make checkins, grab files I was missing, and so on.  I got T-Mobile Total Internet, which is basically unlimited hotspots and unlimited data over GPRS.  Bluetooth dialup and GPRS are awesome when all you had before was &#34;sync before heading to work.&#34;  It&#39;s not even so bad for sending messages over SMTP or using a very, very small amount of IRC.  For anything else, though, it is painful.</p><p>With GPRS, I had ping times around 1000 to 3000 milliseconds.  I get data transfer about 5 KB/s, give or take a bit.  I tried to upgrade to a phone with EDGE, which is just GPRS++, but the difference didn&#39;t register.  For years, T-Mobile has been saying they&#39;re going to get 3G coverage, but they still haven&#39;t set a date.</p><p>I&#39;ve been getting really tired of the awful connection I get, and at YAPC this year, Jason Crome shared out his EVDO connection to the table.  There were a half dozen of us on his connection, and it felt like we were using DSL.  I&#39;ve been waiting and waiting to hear from T-Mobile, but finally I just about gave up, and looked into other options.  (I wrote about this recently, complaining about web pages.)</p><p>Today, my Sprint EVDO modem arrived.  It&#39;s a Sierra Wireless AirCard 595U.  To use it, I had to install a really ugly compiled-for-PowerPC program that made me reboot when it was finished.  I sighed and slogged through the install.  It was worth it.</p><p>With EVDO, I get sustained downstream transfer rates of 70 KB/s and ping times around 100 milliseconds.  It&#39;s just like being on my home network, except possibly for very, very large downloads.  I haven&#39;t tested upstream yet, but I don&#39;t often need to upload very large files from the bus.  I&#39;ll be very amused, though, if my EVDO is much faster than my lousy Speakeasy DSL.</p><p>The real test comes Friday, when I try out the modem on the bus, and see how actual coverage compares to the coverage map. </p></html>

I started out with Verizon's EVDO, until they booted me, and now I'm happy with Sprint EVDO.

They boot you for excessive usage?
