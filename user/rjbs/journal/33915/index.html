<p><html><p>I was very, very excited to receive Super Paper Mario for my birthday.  I&#39;ve
been a big fan of the series (of Mario RPGs) since the first Paper Mario, and
the gimmicks in Super Paper Mario looked really clever.</p><p>When I got the game and started playing, I was still excited.  The sideways
controller felt great, and a few of the early levels are duplicates of original
SMB levels, only now in three dimensions (sort of).  It was brilliant!</p><p>As time went on, though, it got less and less fun.  There was extensive
backtracking, but unlikely Metroid, it was a hassle, not a joy.  Worse, at one
point, after a long series of backtracking, I had to enter &#34;please&#34; on an
on-screen keyboard about five times.  Why?  Just because.</p><p>As more pixls (magic helpers) and heroes join your party, you have to switch
between them.  This requires going to the menu (by hitting &#34;+&#34; which is not
right under your finger as you play), moving through options, and selcting one.
If you need to change both hero and pixl, you need to go through the menu
twice.  There&#39;s a one second (or more?) delay when you switch.  In some levels,
you must do this constantly.  Why isn&#39;t this fast, and mapped to something
painless like trigger-plus-direction?</p><p>Chapter 8 is almost entirely black and white line art, and with no depth of
field, it can be very hard to tell what&#39;s background art and what&#39;s an obstacle
in your way.  As you progress through the chapter, which becomes more and more
boring and maze-like as you go, your other party members leave you.  That
means that if you get sick of it and warp to another level -- one of the fun
levels -- you&#39;re screwed.  You can&#39;t solve puzzles that require anyone but
Mario.</p><p>I hope they make another Paper Mario game.  I don&#39;t even mind the shift toward
being more platformer-like.  I just want it to be fun.  The design problems in
this game are far, far worse than I&#39;d ever expect from Nintendo.</p><p>I found another reviewer who hits on a lot of things I can&#39;t bring myself to
mention.  <a href="http://readerreviews.ign.com/rrview/games/super_paper_mario/853822/65123/">It&#39;s at IGN</a>.</p></html>

FWIW, you don't have to press + to get to the menu.  If you mash 1 and 2 at the same time, the quick menu will pop up.<br/><br/>I agree that it's a PITA to have to change to Peach every time there's a canyon to jump over.  I figured it out the first time... don't make me keep doing it.<br/><br/>(I'm on chapter 6 and the tedium is killing me.)

Thanks!  Maybe someday I'll be ready to give chapter eight another go, and I'll benefit from this...  oh wait, no.  I've already lost the rest of my party -- which is the reason I can't easily kill time by going back and replaying previous chapters.<br><br>Eat me, Nintendo.  Eat me.
