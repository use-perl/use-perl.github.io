<p><html><p>One of the earliest libraries I wrote for Pobox is ICG::CLI.  It makes it easy to write CLI programs by tying together Getopt::Long::Descriptive with some common options (like help and verbose) and a few bits of code to make them work.  So, you got three routines, <code>whisper</code>, <code>say</code>, and <code>yell</code>, which were like <code>printf</code>, but respected the verbose and quiet flags.  (This got refactored into Log::Speak, which I don&#39;t think was ever released.  Oh well.)</p><p>Later, I pulled out Rubric&#39;s subcommand dispatch code out into App::Cmd, and that was a big success, and used GLD, but didn&#39;t get you the printing builtins for verbose operation.  Also, building them in wasn&#39;t going to be easy, because App::Cmd was OO instead of just a few imported routines.  I finally decided on a way to make it happen, about six months ago, and it was a lot of fun to implement.  It makes writing App::Cmd programs even easier, introduces fun uses for Sub::Exporter and lets you write plugins that provide exported functions into all your commands magically.  That means that this is now possible:</p><pre>package MyApp::Command::purge;   use MyApp -command;

sub run {     my ($self, $opt, $args) = @_;

  debug for $args->flatten;   }

1;
</pre><p>...because you can have (for example) a <code>debug</code> routine and autobox imported into every command automatically.  I have a number of plugins to write to make this possible, and I&#39;ve basically been putting off the release for months, waiting to get them written, but I had enough people saying, &#34;Seriously, can you release what&#39;s in your git repo?&#34; that I finally broke down and did it.</p><p>Hopefully I&#39;ll get some cool plugins written, real soon now. </p></html>
