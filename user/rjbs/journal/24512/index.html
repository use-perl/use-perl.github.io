<p>At work, I'm trying to be busy and productive, but it's hard for a few reasons. I know I can't finish the current project, so I'm trying to deal with some edge cases, but mostly to write documentation.  I've written a number of documents for my theoretical successor describing at a glance the state of various projects.  Now I'm trying to find all the weird little things I tend to take care of now and then and document those.  I've called on the staff to let me know what weird things I do, but response so far as been so-so.  (I was reminded of a few weird things, though, so that was good.)  I'm not too worried, since I imagine that things I forget may end up becoming consulting visits.<br/><br/>I want the transition when I go to be nice and smooth, but it's hard to know just what to do.  Perhaps Perl Medic will provide me with some inspiration.<br/><br/>In the meantime, I got my new display, which will make my life easier when working at home.  Since I no longer need to work on Win32, I wanted a nice display for my Mac, and I got one I knew I'd like: the same one I used at work! I picked up an HP L2035 from Tiger Direct.  The price was good, and the product arrived with no major delay, but I don't think I'll do business with them again.  They said they'd use UPS, but used FedEx, who left the package in the unlocked vestibule, even though someone was home and would have answered the door.  Also, this whole Apple lawsuit is more moronic than most moronic lawsuits, in my opinion.  NewEgg seems to be a better retailer, although they didn't have this model.<br/><br/>Here's <a href='http://rjbs.manxome.org/images/home/office-new_workstation.html'>a picture of my new workstation</a>.<br/><br/>I started using it last night, but it was a real pain.  I had to reach across the desk to type.  Obviously, I could've moved the laptop, but that would've been less nicely organized; the real solution (and plan, from the beginning) was to get an external keyboard.  Gloria swung by Double-Click for me, today, and grabbed an Apple Wireless Keyboard.  The keyboard itself isn't the best  keyboard I've ever used, but it's not so bad.  I'm playing around with its wirelessness at the moment, and I think it might turn out to be a nice little bit of kit. </p>
