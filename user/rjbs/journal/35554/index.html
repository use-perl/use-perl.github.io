<p><p>Ugh.  A while ago, I wrote about the difficulties involved in <a href="http://rjbs.manxome.org/rubric/entry/1500">getting wasted
in Pennsylvania</a>.  Normally, it only
affects me as trivia.  The thrice-cursed monopoly's stores carry the brands
that I'm used to buying.  Their prices aren't intolerable.</p>

<p>This week, however, they have lost me forever.  As far as I'm concerned, the
PLCB needs to be busted.</p>

<p>Rye whiskey is a traditional style of American whiskey, and Pennsylvania used
to produce a lot of it before Prohibition.  Now it mostly comes from
bourbon-producing states, like Kentucky -- even labels that use Pennsylvanian
names and recipes, like Rittenhouse Rye.  Rittenhouse produces some of the
best-reviewed rye out there, and recently won awards at one show for being both
the best rye <em>and</em> the best value.</p>

<p>I really want a bottle of it.</p>

<p>The monopoly store didn't have any on the shelf.  In fact, they didn't have
<em>any</em> rye.  I went to the PLCB website and found that the only rye whiskey they
distribute normally is Jim Beam.  At first I couldn't find Rittenhouse at all,
because it was listed under "Rye (Bottled-In Bond)" rather than "Rye
(Straight)."  This is a pretty bizarre distinction, and I can't imagine that
none of the other ryes are bottled in bond.  They probably just don't make
noise about it.</p>

<p>Anyway, I found it, and their price is great: $12 a bottle.  The bad news is
that the only distributor they can get it from will only supply it by the case.
So, think about that: the PLCB has a monopoly on liquor sales in the state, and
they still can't offer me what I want because their hands are tied by some
distributor.</p>

<p>At this point, in a state that was not insane, I would go to another store, but
I can't.  They're all the same, here.  In a state that was not insane, I might
then try ordering a bottle online, but I can't do that in Pennsylvania.
Because of the PLCB, no one is allowed to sell booze to me over the internet --
except for the PLCB.  Not only do they not sell Rittenhouse Rye at their web
store, they don't sell <em>any</em> rye whiskey.</p>

<p>So, if I want to try a bottle of rye once made in my state, I need to either
buy a case, find people with whom to split a case, or drive to New Jersey and
buy it there.  I think that the only sane option -- going to Jersey -- might
actually be illegal.  I'm going to do it anyway.</p>

The bit that really surprises me is that, as the government-operated monopoly, they aren't OBLIGATED to buy a case, just so they can give you one of them, and then, you know, put the rest on a shelf and sell it?<br><br>I think it might be in Norway where exactly this happens.<br><br>There's a state-run monopoly, but as part of that they are obligated to find a way to get you what you want.<br>

I'm not a lawyer, but the <a href="http://www.lcb.state.pa.us/plcb/cwp/view.asp?a=1334&amp;Q=546185&amp;pp=3#sect305" title="state.pa.us">
Pennsylvania Liquor Code</a state.pa.us> seems to imply that they can't make you buy more than two bottles.  I guess it depends on what "provided that such product is available through the State store system" means.

<h2>ship it to your liquor store?</h2>

I've heard that you _can_ order booze from outside PA, just that you need to have it delivered to a state store for pickup.  a little google found this to be true:<br/><br/>  <a href="http://xrl.us/bfk3r" title="xrl.us">http://xrl.us/bfk3r</a xrl.us><br/><br/>but maybe it's only wine...<br/><br/>of course, things could be worse - when I first moved to PA you weren't allowed to charge alcohol.  thankfully that changed<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>You win.</h2>

Your state liquor laws are weirder than Kansas'.<br>
