<p><html><p>I am getting pretty darned sick of CPAN Ratings.  They can be quite useful: I can see what modules people like or don&#39;t like, and I can get an idea of why people like or don&#39;t like my modules.</p><p>But then there&#39;s the crypto bug report rating.  I&#39;ve ranted about it before, and I&#39;ll do it again.  Look, you ungrateful bastards, ratings are not good for reporting bugs.  The author isn&#39;t informed of the bug, and he has no way to reply.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s a great module, but it doesn&#39;t work on Windows!&#34;  Oops, I try to support Windows.  What doesn&#39;t work?  Well, I don&#39;t know, and I can&#39;t ask you because there is no means to contact a rater.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s a great module, but it doesn&#39;t work on Windows! (redux)&#34;  Yes, it does, I use it there daily!  Maybe it used to not work, but it does now.  I&#39;d ask you to either explain your rating or change it, but I can&#39;t, because there is no means to contact a rater.</p><p>&#34;This module is bloated and has too many prereqs!&#34;  You&#39;re right, it relied on a module that had lots of silly prereqs, but I&#39;ve fixed that.  I&#39;ll just...</p><p>Well, you get the idea.  I&#39;d love to see a &#34;reply to rater,&#34; even if only available to the author being rated.  I&#39;d love to see a &#34;this rating is factually untrue&#34; button.  Heck, I&#39;d be mostly satisfied with a big &#34;please consider filing a bug report, if you&#39;re going to report a bug in this rating&#34; box.  It should probably blink yellow on red. </p></html>

"did you find this rating/comment useful? [ ] Yes  [ ] No"

The problem is that "this rating didn't help me" sounds like, "This did not help me make a decision," which is a very different thing from "this rating is FALSE and you should ignore it."

well, I think some sort of karma system could help the problem. Yes, I think the module authors need some way of saying "this was a problem 8 versions ago" or whatever. However, some way for other users to say "this is a pointless rating" might be helpful too.

That already does exist, just like (say) Amazon's.  I use it when I know the rating is wrong, but I hate using it when the rating is a bug report with insufficient data.  It might really be a problem, but I can't tell!
