<p>cwinters has been awesome enough to lend me his extra Kinesis Ergo Contour keyboard.  Since I've got someone visiting this week, I've stuck to the simple split-key keyboard, so that I can continue to work as normal.  The plan is to really start using it next week.  Today, though, the guest left work for a few hours, feeling under the weather, so I hooked up the Kinesis and got to work. Sort of.<br/><br/>It's really weird.  In some ways, it feels normal and natural.  I can type many sentences without thinking about it.  In others, I am completely mystified.  So far, here are some big problems: the escape key is ridiculously-placed.  It's a soft rubber key up on the corner, and I need to move my whole hand to hit it. Control and alt are also hard to use as modifiers more than now and then. There is no easy-to-hit Windows key, which I use extensively as a bucky key.  A few keys are positioned such that I need to be more strict about "proper" keyboarding, like p and c.  It's hard to his them with the wrong finger, as I'm used to doing.<br/><br/>I've played with remapping some keys to solve the first few problems.  Clearly, the keyboard was not designed for unix programmers.  I turned caps lock into control and delete into escape.  This was good until I realized that I needed delete for alt-ctrl-delete on Windows.  I may need to do some planning.  I just don't know how I feel about remapping the keyboard before I'm used to using it normally.<br/><br/>The Windows key is being a problem, though.  The manual suggests that keypad+f12 (or something like that) gives me a Windows key, but I can't seem to confirm that I can use it as a modifier, which is a big deal.  I need to connect this to a machine with xev, since I can't find a good scancode dumper for Win32.  (Pointers welcome.)<br/><br/>Still, I'm hopeful.  It felt better in a few ways, and if I can get to a good speed, I might be converted, especially if Mac usability is good.<br/><br/>Hints from the contour-using public are welcome. </p>

The keys under the ZXC... line are very hard to reach.<br> <br>I've remapped keypad T Y G H to [ ] { } and E S D F to cursor keys respectively. I have a foot switch for keypad access, and that really helps.<br> <br>After two months, I'm still not really used to the keyboard, but that is probably because I cannot use a keyboard for a longer period of time. I really need a good keyboard, and will keep wasting money until I find the perfect one. So far, the Kinesis Ergo has both been disappointing and making me happy. I'm so glad I bought a remappable one. I'll see in another few months if then I can really type well with it. Now, I sometimes get another keyboard to get the job done quickly.<br> <br>IMHO, the keyboard should have had one vertical line of extra keys on the inside, instead of the horrible 2-lines-down keys under the ZXC line.<br> <br>(Note that I type Dvorak, but used QWERTY key labels in this post)
