<div class="span8">
<p><p>Ages ago, I got an <a href="http://audible.com">Audible</a> membership.  Three days each
week, I walk about half an hour to the bus and about half an hour home.  For
most of the year, I can spend that time reading a book.  In the winter, though,
it's just too cold.  My fingers freeze, even if I read with one hand in my
pocket and switch back and forth.  Audible sells audiobooks, and I can listen
to them on my iPod while I walk.  They have a subscription model where get one
or two credits each month, and each credit can be exchanged for one book.
Sometimes, this is an okay deal: you pay $15 per month and get a $25 copy of
the abridged version of a popular novel.  Sometimes, it is a great deal: you
get a $40 copy of a twenty-five hour classic.</p>

<p>I cancelled my old membership when winter ended, but my sister got me a gift
certificate for Christmas (because I'd asked for one) and I signed up again.  I
got in on a promotional rate of about $7 per month.  This week, I downloaded
the 41 hour unabridged audiobook of Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire, volume one... for $7.</p>

<p>Audible lets you download files in their <code>.aa</code> format, which is basically an
MP3 wrapped up in some DRM.  I'm not a fan of restricted media files, but
Audible has such good deals that I don't mind.  iTunes has a plugin that lets
you authorize your computer to play your Audible tracks.  Ever since I
rejoined, it's been giving me grief: I try to play a track and I have to
re-enter my password.  After that, all my Audible files will play until I quit,
when I have to re-enter my password again.</p>

<p>It's not some easy six character password, either, it's a big monster generated
by 1Password.</p>

<p>I was concerned that I'd broken something in my account, the way I broke things
(I think) by stripping PPC and certain languages from Mail.app.  I hadn't
touched anything since I reinstalled, though!  Why was this happening?</p>

<p>I had a heck of a time finding information on this until I stumbled across

<a href="http://ursecta.com/wp/2007/12/barely-audible/">this blog post</a> that pointed
out the undisclosed fact that when you authorize iTunes to play your Audible
content, <em>you must be logged in as an administrator</em>.  I have no idea why.
Maybe it stores your token somewhere in <code>/Library</code>.  I am pretty damned sure
that no matter what the reason, the reason is stupid.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm pretty annoyed at Audible about this, but not annoyed enough to
write them off forever.  I mean, even at their normal rate, $15 for a forty
hour audiobook is a pretty great deal.  Maybe I'll even stay subscribed through
the summer, this year.</p></p>

<h2>Audible+Amazon</h2>

Did you see Thursday (IIRC) that Amazon is buying Audible?<br>

I did see that!  So far, it seems to have no impact on anything.  Maybe eventually (ha!) audiobooks will be available as DRM-free mp3s.  That would be nice.  I mean, I imagine that I could go torrent most of the stuff I'm buying, it's just a hassle and I like to feel like I'm helping people stay employed.  I just wish they'd help me, in return, keep my blood pressure down.<br><br>We'll see!

I don't think the purchase is final, so it'll likely be awhile before any real changes make it to the surface.<br><br>Carl does something magic to turn his Audible stuff into MP3. I could ask him what he's using, if you want.<br>

<h2>Audible to MP3</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ravenx99/">ravenx99</a> on 2008-02-04T22:22:39</h3>
Hey, Ricardo...<br><br>This requires Windows.  I don't know how to do it on other platforms without capturing the audio in real-time.<br><br>Audible has gone around and DMCA-threatened folks for posting details on how to do this, so I'll list the pieces... you can figure it out from there.  (For the record, I do this to play on a non-DRM-enabled device.)<br><br>dBpoweramp Music Converter + its WMA codec<br>Audible's Windows Media Player plugin<br><br>That will get you one big WAV file, at a fraction of playback speed, for each<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.aa file.<br><br>I to split these into bite-sized chunks with AudioSeparator and then run them through the encoder of my choice.  dBpoweramp will encode to MP3 if you buy the encoder plugin.  (Everything you need to get to WAV output is free.)<br><br>I've stopped splitting the files lately, because I use the Open Source Rockbox firmware replacement (on a Sansa e200 series), which has divine multiple-bookmark capability and user-scalable seek speed and acceleration rate.  I can seek an hour in a matter of seconds.<br>

Have you tried the audio books on eMusic?  They are DRM-free MP3.

eMusic.com shows me one giant image that links to signup.  I can't see any way to browse their offerings.<br><br>I don't see any reason to sign up for Who Knows What.

Hm, actually, after trying a bunch of links, I found it by going to About Us, then to the "Browse" tab.<br><br>Good work, jerks.

...and then, for example, they have only the abridged version of Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, and they have only vols 1-2, of 3.
