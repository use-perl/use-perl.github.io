<p><p>Today has been a weird day, full of all kinds of stuff.</p>

<p>This morning, we went to the hospital and Gloria had more ultrasounds.  We got some new photos of the baby's head and face.</p>

<p>I left my phone at home (oops!), so I had no network connection on the bus, so I couldn't test the database parts of the database-heavy code I'm working on. Instead, I wrote documentation and reviewed the sanity of the design.  I let Enterprise play in the background, leading to today's earlier entry.</p>

<p>At work, I made some significant, but insufficient, progress on my current task.  I think I may now have it in a position where I can finish it in the next 48 hours, but... I'm not excited about the pace at which I'll have to work.  Still, the design is pretty decent, compared to what I had to work with before.</p>

<p>I was going to work through lunch, but the whole office went to have lunch with John, which was fun.  I had a burrito and a tamarind soda, which is a rare treat.  (I'm OK with that.  I think it would be weird to drink it more often.) We had a good time, then returned to the office, where I tried to get through some more work.  When I got to a good stopping point, just before five, I did some small things to make me feel like I'd completed an entire task.  That was pleasant.</p>

<p>On the bus home it was the same story: no network.  I worked on a script to move my photos from manxome.org to Flickr.  I think it's clear that I'm not going to get around to making Rubric do galleries any time really soon, and I'm happy with Flickr.  I need to figure out how best to use Net::Flickr::Backup, but I think it will be just fine.</p>

<p>With a little digging and tweaking and cursing, I got jgal2flickr working.  I'm now working on uploading my first few batches of photos.  I don't plan, just yet, on upgrading to a Pro account, so it may take a few months.</p>

<p>When I got home, there were two packages for me from Gloria's parents.  Since I recognized the company that had sent them, I had a good guess as to their contents, and didn't feel bad about opening them up.  It's my first Christmas present: a five-string banjo!  In my eagerness to get it up and running -- despite having absolutely no clue what I was doing -- I broke the third string. Fortunately, the in-laws had included replacements!  This was a humbling, and sort of depressing, experience.  The good thing about it is that it put me firmly in my place:  I know nothing, and will just hurt myself and my property if I pretend I don't.  Tomorrow or Wednesday, I'll go to the local guitar place and ask for help restringing, tuning, and about lessons.</p>

<p>Now it's time to work the "last" few bugs out of my Flickr script and see if I can get my bank's "deposit online with your scanner" thing working for Gloria. It only works on Win32, which is sort of a bigger deal right now than it should be.  It'd be nice to get it working.  I was really annoyed when they dropped their "free UPS overnight deposits" program.</p>

<p>Off to work. </p>
