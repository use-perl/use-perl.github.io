<p><html><p>Look, I respect the diversity of foreign cultures and everything.  I try to
pronounce silly foreign names correctly, and I have learned to stop referring
to Holland as &#34;the Netheregions.&#34;  In turn, could everybody please officially
transliterate their languages to 7-bit?  Honestly, it would make everything a
lot easier... at least for Addex, which is the top world priority, right?</p><p>I have some friends and colleagues who refuse to change their names &#34;just
because my software is too parochial,&#34; so I&#39;ve been forced to try to deal with
it.  See, Apple Address Book is all unicode, but Mac::Glue returns strings in
MacRoman when it can (read: for the names I&#39;ve got in there).  My mutt doesn&#39;t
even like Unicode very much.  Anyway, too, if I want to send a message to my
friend JosÃÂ©, I want to be able to hit j-o-s-e-TAB.</p><p>So, I don&#39;t want to try to fix mutt and everything else, because that would
help too many other people.  I just want to help Addex users.</p><p>I had to go through a lot of weird steps to get this working.  The first
problem was to decompose the decoded-from-MacRoman Unicode that I was getting
back.  Then I dropped out the NUL at the end and any combining characters.
This didn&#39;t fix SÃÂ¸ren, whose stupid Viking name kept its stupid Viking
letter.  It turns out that LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH STROKE doesn&#39;t decompose.
I figured this out only after assuming it was a Mac::Glue bug and whining at
pudge about it for a while.</p><p>You can see the horrible, horrible steps I&#39;ve taken below.  This code will be
optional in the next App::Addex.</p><pre>use Unicode::Normalize qw(normalize);
use Unicode::UCD 'charinfo';
use charnames ':full';

sub __degrade_to_ascii {
  return $_[0] if $_[0] =~ /^[\x01-\x79]*$/;
  my $decomp = normalize(D => $_[0]);
  my $recomp =
    join '', map { chr(hex($_->{code})) }
    map  {
      ($_->{name} =~ /^(LATIN \w+ LETTER .) WITH/)
      ? charinfo(charnames::vianame("$1"))
      : $_
    }
    grep { $_->{code} =~ /[^0]/ }
    grep { $_->{block} !~ /combin/i }
    map  { charinfo(ord substr $decomp, $_, 1) }  0 .. length $decomp;
}

Yeah, the only place it's not very good is in aliases, to be fair.  Everything else is great.
