<p>Well, UltraDNS still hasn't updated their data, so clients are still being sent to my old IP.  You can imagine that I am less and less thrilled with this as the days go by.  The DNS needs an enema. <br/><br/>Yesterday, I realized that if people were still getting sent to my old IP, I could probably get Speakeasy to move that IP from my old (defunct) loop to my new one.  After all, it's on the same subnet.  I called them, and got bounced around a lot of automated phone menus.  They were dreadful, dumping me frequently into messages that immediately hung up afterward.  Finally, I got into a queue for a CSR.  After about ten minutes on hold, it decided to tell me that they were gone for the weekend.  Why did I need to hold just to find that out?<br/><br/>I gave up and filed a ticket with them, and within half an hour I got an email back that they'd moved the IP.  I made a new tinydns installation, added an IP to the server, and immediately the mail started coming in!  Awesome.<br/><br/>I'm really annoyed with UltraDNS, but at least Speakeasy is just as awesome as ever.  Dealing with this mess has reminded me that I enjoy system administration.  I remember that, when I got my current job, I was really look for sysadmin work, and that programming was just something to do in the meantime.  I guess things turned out alright, but it would be nice to have goofy systems problems to deal with now and then.  Of course, we use Win32 at work, and I don't want any problems with those systems.  They wouldn't be goofy, they'd be hellish.<br/><br/>Anyway, the point is that manxome.org resolves again, so we're getting mail, and all the other little internal services work.  Things seem mucher nicer from the outside, too.  I guess I may now feel driven to do more work on jGal and start getting my backlog of photos up. </p>
