<p><html><p>I first started using procmail around 1993, I guess, when I got my first access to the Internet through my dad&#39;s alumni account at Lehigh University.  The only programming language I knew was C (and things that don&#39;t count, like Logo and BASIC), so procmail was like magic.</p><p>Of course, I also didn&#39;t know very much about email, and my needs were few.</p><p>So, now I get a few hundred pieces of legitimate email every day, and a few thousand pieces of spam.  I need to keep my mail organized, sequester spam, and never lose mail that I wanted.  If I do lose mail that I wanted, it needs to be easy to figure out where it went.</p><p>I&#39;ve slowly grown my procmailrc file over the years, tweaked my SpamAssassin config, and handed out a lot of different addresses at various domains.</p><p>I really don&#39;t like procmail, because while it&#39;s fine for doing really, really simple filtering, it&#39;s just insanely painful to use for complicated filtering. It has really esoteric features (see the man page for procmailsc, sometime) but its boolean logic and flow-control structures are a joke.  Every time I had to change something in my procmailrc, I grumbled and thought about replacing it with a proper program.</p><p>Every time I tweak my SpamAssassin rules, I think about how I work for a company that offers really good spam protection (and lots of other benefits) that I don&#39;t take advantage of, largely because it would be a hassle to keep using my other weird settings.</p><p>Friday, I bit the bullet and started making the big change, moving most of my email to Pobox and all of my local delivery filtering to an Email::Filter script.  It&#39;s pretty awesome to see procmail gone, and to start to benefit personally from Pobox features that I&#39;ve written or improved.</p><p>It&#39;s also great that now I can clearly see specific things that I don&#39;t like about Email::Filter and great ways that we can improve Pobox.  The actual changeover to Pobox was a pain in my butt, because of my quirky configuration. Now that it&#39;s done, I&#39;m really happy with it, and I look forward to learning a lot from the work I have yet to come -- and to having new things to gripe about. </p></html>

<h2>beeeurk procmail</h2>

procmail code is unreadable and seems badly implemented to todays standards.<br><br>i already wondered several times why script kiddies don't throw their fuzzy engines against it.
