<p>The index cards and push pins I ordered arrived today.  I took down the cards for the aborted "let's code together!" project, but I haven't put anything new up.  The cards for the characterization system are still there, mocking me.  I need to put up a card for the current blocker, "dynamic by-variant widgets."<br/><br/>Or, better, "feel enthused."<br/><br/>I'm a little more enthused about some of my personal work.  Rubric is now at a state where I could use it instead of del.icio.us for storing my own links. Hopefully it will be cleaner, faster, and more featureful by December.  Some index cards would read: with no current_user, group recent entries by URI; port to PostgreSQL; add optional long text field to entries; add paging of large entry sets.  Maybe I'll write a Bryar datasource.  Also, documentation.<br/><br/>I got an email from my mother, yesterday, informing me that a family friend died.  He was only 28, and there was no cause given in the paper.  He and I weren't close, but it's weird.  He had a wife and daughter.  I only regularly communicate with two friends from my high school days.  I wonder whether everyone else is OK.<br/><br/>At the gym, I found an interesting magazine on the shelf: "In Character."  It's published three times per year (they say; this is their first issue), and each issue is a series of essays and interviews about a single "everyday virtue." This issue was "thrift," and "purpose" is next.  I really enjoyed it, and I think there's about a half workout's worth of articles left for me.<br/><br/>As a side-note, I stumbled across the pseudo-word "quartermesterly," but I don't think it's an accepted English word.  I wish the OED was freely available online. </p>

If something were to occur in each quartermester then it would occur quarterly

No, it would occur three times per year, because it would occur every four months.  A trimester is three months (tri + mestris) and a semester is six months (ses + mestris).

Wouldn't that be a quadrimester, not a quartermester?
