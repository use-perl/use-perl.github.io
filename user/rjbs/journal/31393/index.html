<p><p>This weekend, my brother was in town and offered to help me with some house work.  I took almost all of his aid in the form of wallpaper removal.  I got some scrapers, a paper tiger, a few spray bottles, and two gallons of vinegar. As things stand now, the third floor is mostly depapered, except for some hard-to-reach areas high above the stairwell.  I would say that on average, Steve was about ten times as productive as I was.</p>

<p>The walls are all plaster, and have two or three layers of wallpaper.  None of them are peel-off, and there are lots of patches in the plaster where the scraper would happily dip in and make a nice gouge.  Over the next few weeks, I hope I can get some of the last bits of paper and paste of the walls.  Then it will be time to call in a contractor friend for help patching the walls in preparation for painting -- assuming the leak in the south wall has been closed by then!</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to making the third floor habitable.  It will add a good three hundred square feet (or so) of space, and should eventually be a nice return when we sell the house.</p>

<p>The biggest lesson I've learned so far is: old wallpaper sucks. </p>

In spades: we've now removed all the wallpaper from our house except for the bathroom. For comparison: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cwinters/sets/531689/" title="flickr.com">old stuff</a flickr.com>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cwinters/sets/532069/" title="flickr.com">in progress</a flickr.com>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cwinters/sets/532138/" title="flickr.com">"finished"</a flickr.com>. And yes, in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cwinters/23067860/in/set-531689/" title="flickr.com">original dining room</a flickr.com> that is wallpaper over wood panels -- much nicer <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cwinters/23093518/in/set-532138/" title="flickr.com">now</a flickr.com>, I think<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Very nice!  I'm looking forward to slowly remaking the house in our own image, and success stories from other people make me feel like this is possible.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
