<div class="span8">
<p><p>Someone complained, looking at the beta version of some new reports, that the "when" field was too precise.  They didn't need "17 days and 6 hours ago," "17 days ago" would do.  I was doing this with Sean Burke's Time::Duration, wrapped by my own Time::Duration::Object, which just turns a number of seconds into an object with methods based on the functions provided by Time::Duration.  It's been a very useful module, but I never noticed that it had a major bug.</p>

<pre>my $duration = Time::Duration::Object->new(87000);
say $duration->ago;
</pre>

<p>The above code outputs "1 day and 10 minutes ago," which is just right.  The following code should limit itself to one unit -- meaning "1 day ago." Instead, it outputted something like "just now."</p>

<pre>my $duration = Time::Duration::Object->new(87000);
say $duration->ago(1);
</pre>

<p>I was pretty perplexed, until I went to look at the code.</p>

<pre>for (@methods) {
  my $method = \&{"Time::Duration::$_"};
  *{$_} = sub {
    push @_, ${(shift)};
    my $result = &$method(@_);
    bless \$result => 'Time::Duration::_Result';
  }
}
</pre>

<p>The above constructs the methods in Time::Duration::Object.  TDO objects are just blessed scalars containing their number of seconds.  Do you see the moronic error?</p>

<p>Well, the arguments to the method should always be <code>(object, args...)</code> but I screwed up.  I said to push the object onto the stack, so it was effectively <code>(args..., object)</code>.  That works great when args is an empty list, but not so much when there are some arguments.  Instead of calling <code>ago(87000,1)</code> my method was calling <code>ago(1,87000)</code>.  So, this was a one-word fix, which was a nice change.</p>

<p>I added a test, too.</p>

<p>After doing that, though, I decided I had better up the test coverage.  I found that it was already 100%, and then realized that it had been 100% even before I added that test.  There is no branch or condition regarding whether <code>@_</code> is populated, and adding one just to get coverage testing to show up would've been silly.  This major but unseen bug does a great job of demonstrating that 100% coverage is not enough to ensure that your code works perfectly -- or even very well at all.  I <em>knew</em> that already, but it's nice to have it rubbed in, now and again.</p>

<p>The more depressing thing (I guess) is that this module has been on the CPAN for something like sixteen months and nobody noticed -- presumably because I'm the only person using it.  Oh well, I still think it's useful!</p>

<p>I was actually doing this through our internal subclass of Time::Piece.  I'm a big fan of Time::Piece, because it's simple and nearly always good enough for what I need.  The problem is that subclassing it has traditionally sucked. There are a few reasons, but the biggest is that it's in the horrible habit of blessing objects into <code>__PACKAGE__</code>, meaning that all (or most) objects constructed by subclasses end up being Time::Piece objects instead of whatever they should be.  For example:</p>

<pre>my $time = Time::Piece::SwatchBeats->localtime;
my $tomorrow = ONE_DAY;
</pre>

<p>Oops!  <code>$tomorrow</code> is a Time::Piece object.  It will not stringify into your awesome <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time">Swatch Internet Time</a> string.</p>

<p>This kept biting me in the butt, especially when writing a test for <code>ago</code>'s precision.  I'd build a "yesterday-ish" object and check <code>ago</code>, only to be told "can't find method ago via the DynaLoader" or some such crap.</p>

<p>Matt Sergeant was very receptive to my bitching, and accepted my patch to Time::Piece.  Version 1.09 is on the CPAN, and can be properly subclassed. Hooray!</p></p>
