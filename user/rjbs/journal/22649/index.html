<p>I'm a little worried about knave.  When he's sitting on a flat surface (the desk, the floor, my lap) everything is fine.  When I rotate it so the base is not parallel with the floor, it makes a noise.  I mentioned this before, but now I know what the noise reminds me of:  the sound that hair clippers make when they get jammed.  It's also interesting that this noise only occurs while I'm turning the machine.  If I hold it at a 45 degree angle with the floor, and keep it still, it's quiet, but if I constantly turn it side to side, the noise persists.<br/><br/>I hope nothing bad happens.  I didn't opt to buy the extended AppleCare, which so far has not been a bad thing.  I got knave in 2003-07, just in time for OSCON.  My original plan was for a two year lifecycle, but lately I've been thinking that it should last three.<br/><br/>It looks like the current direct replacement would run me about $1900; the only upgrade I'd feel like I'd need would be the 512 stick of RAM, which would bring me to 768, 128 more than I have in this machine.  I could get a 1G stick, for a gig and a quarter total, which would bring the total price to $2300, well over the price of knave.  It would be about 500MHz faster and have twice the storage and twice the VRAM (who cares?).  Actually, it looks like I could pick it up with the stock RAM and buy a 1G stick from Crucial for $500, bringing my total to about $2100, a bit over knave's price.<br/><br/>I'd like to see some keen new PowerBook stuff happen, but I'm not holding my breath.  Price drops would be nice, speed boosts without price hikes would be nice, and a dual core G4 would be great.  Still, the best thing of all would be for this laptop to last until those happens, and then longer. </p>

<h2>Moving parts</h2>

The only moving parts in a laptop are the hard drive and CDROM, so it sounds like a hard drive problem.  Maybe try removing it, then reseating it and see if the problem goes away.  Are you getting any drive errors? (not sure how to check that on a mac)

Oh, and also the exhaust fan for the cpu.  Those can definitely jam up also from dust.

<h2>cheaper memory</h2>

For my 15" PB I picked up a Kingmax 1GB SODIMM from <a href="http://www.newegg.com/" title="newegg.com">newegg</a newegg.com> a few months ago for ~US$200 and have been mostly happy with it. I have some sporadic issues with the PB not waking up from sleep mode from closing the lid, but it doesn't seem to happen if I force it into sleep from the apple menu.
