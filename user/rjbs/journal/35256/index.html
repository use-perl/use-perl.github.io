<p><html><p>I didn&#39;t get around to writing a todo for 2007, apparently.  I did write a
<a href="http://rjbs.manxome.org/rubric/entry/1203">todo for 2006</a>, though.  I also
wrote a <a href="http://rjbs.manxome.org/rubric/entry/1383">review of my progress</a>, in
January.</p><ul><li>waste less time</li><li>read more</li><li>learn more (computer) languages</li><li>use more (human) languages more often</li><li>learn to drive a car</li><li>buy a house</li></ul><p>I bought a house in September 2006, but the rest are all decent goals to take
as read for 2007.  I... well, I didn&#39;t do too well.  I meant to have a driver&#39;s
license well before Martha was born, but I didn&#39;t get a learner&#39;s permit until
February, and I still haven&#39;t gotten a license.  My brother-in-law has
volunteered to help me get ready for my test, and my permit expires in
February, so I think I may actually finally get my license -- only thirteen
years after nearly everybody else in my age group.</p><p>I&#39;ve written a good bit more to family members who aren&#39;t native
English-speakers, but I&#39;ve lazily written only in English.  I keep meaning to
tie this goal to my &#34;read more&#34; goal, so that I can read a book or two in
Spanish or German each year.  It doesn&#39;t happen.</p><p>My reading in 2007 was actually not too bad.  I didn&#39;t read many books of
substance, but I burned through a decent amount of fairly light reading, almost
exclusively walking between home and the bus.  I finished a number of series
that I&#39;d been working on, and I hope to at least continue that trend this
coming year.  I need to try to find the complete Nero Wolfe.  That should fill
quite a few walks.</p><p>I haven&#39;t done more than usually well at working with new programming
languages.  I did some more Ruby and Python, which is nothing new.  I did some
more playing around in Haskell, but nothing really interesting.  I wrote a
little more Lisp.  I read the first few chapters of Programming Erlang, but I
haven&#39;t put much of it to use.  I think that this year, my first priority is
actually going to be <em>more</em> Perl, as I want to do some things that will require
I delve into B and XS.  I still hope to do some work in Erlang, too, at least.
I&#39;m so behind on actually getting established projects done, though, that it&#39;s
hard to realistically think I&#39;ll start picking up new things just for the joy
of it.</p><p>&#34;Waste less time&#34; is sort of a weird goal.  I don&#39;t know how to measure it or
call it met.  This year, I started using OmniFocus instead of (among other
things) index cards to track the things I wanted to do.  In 2008, I am going to
keep it populated with the things I need to do, with due dates -- and I&#39;m going
to try to stay on top of my todos.</p><p>Now that we&#39;ve bought a house, I get to replace that goal with &#34;fix the house
up.&#34;  I need to finally make the third floor habitable, make the back yard
rompable, and deal with all the interior doors.  (There are plenty of other
projects, too.)</p><p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to proclaim any other big goals for 2008.  That&#39;s quite
enough work already, and my I&#39;ve got plenty of other little goals to deal with.</p></html>
