<p><html><p>Recently, Daniel Jalkut was doing that thing that has, sadly, become pretty popular in modern blogging: announcing his hot new product before telling us what it&#39;s for. (Did this start with Segway? I&#39;m sure there are some prior examples that I can&#39;t think of.) Anyway, it turned out to be <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blackink/">Black Ink</a>, a really nice looking Cocoa-based crossword puzzle program. It started out pretty buggy, but has gotten a little better. It costs $25, which probably isn&#39;t too unreasonable, but I can&#39;t see myself spending that much on a game that I&#39;ll only play now and then.</p><p>It works by downloading files from newspaper sites. They&#39;re named things like &#34;Wall Street Journal (3-23-07).puz&#34; and their contents looked pretty straight-forward. I found some good notes on the format compiled by <a href="http://www.joshisanerd.com/puz/">Josh Meyer</a>, and that led me to produce <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Games-Crossword-Puzzle">Games::Crossword::Puzzle</a>, which I used to produce a simple HTML formatted crossword template.</p><p>I&#39;d really like to write a PUZ-to-HTML compiler to produce playable cross-platform puzzles. It should actually be pretty easy, although getting the interface down will take a while of experimentation and tweaking. I&#39;m not sure how I want to handle saving state. In an ideal world, I would have some simple way to bless the file as having permission to update a section of itself, saving form state. That just isn&#39;t possible. Other solutions seem to include compiling to Firefox chrome (John C. suggests that mere XUL will not have useful access to Firefox&#39;s offline storage) or using Dojo Offline.</p><p>If only Curses::UI worked properly on Mac OS X, I might consider using that, instead.</p><p>Genius-brain-inspired suggestions welcome.</p></html>

<h2>Great minds...</h2>

I actually toyed with some similar project ideas after seeing Black Ink.  It really is a nice looking program, to the point where I instinctively start thinking of related applications...<br><br>I was planning on doing a web app that used browser based offline storage (i.e. Dojo Offline or the new WHATWG client-side storage stuff in recent versions of Firefox), so you could have a community site to allow crossword addicts to share their scores and talk to each other while still allowing offline play, so people can play on the train and whatnot.<br><br>I also noticed that Evan Martin had some interesting stuff he'd coded up on web based crossword apps, available at:<br><br><a href="http://community.livejournal.com/evan_tech/tag/crosswords" title="livejournal.com">http://community.livejournal.com/evan_tech/tag/crosswords</a livejournal.com><br><br>That's about the point where I lost interest though<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
