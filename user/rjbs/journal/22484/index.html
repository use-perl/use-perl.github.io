<p>Today is my second day off from work.  It's dumb to work between Christmas and New Year's, and my intention is not to do it again.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I'm sick.  I have a head cold, which isn't horribly incapacitating or anything, but it's not pleasant.  Breathing is weird, I'm not sleeping very well, and I don't feel like I can concentrate.  I've been playing a lot of Mario Golf, which has been fun, but I'd meant to do more reading and get some Halo 2 practice in.  Anyway, it's not the worst thing ever, but I'd rather have been sick during a work week.<br/><br/>Gloria and I watched Stagecoach, which was pretty good, considering it was a John Wayne western.  We also watched Citizen Kane, which I hadn't seen in at least ten years.  It was good, too.  I like Orson Welles, and am wondering whether I can train myself to always speak like him.<br/><br/>I've begun reading Less Than Zero, and I'm enjoying it; it reminds me quite a bit of American Psycho, which makes sense, since it's the same author.  I also read Invincible (the first trade paperback) and enjoyed it quite a lot.  It was too short!<br/><br/>Newly received loot:
<pre>* book: Johnny the Homicidal Maniac (trade paperback)
* dvd: Invader Zim, Volume 3
* book: Invincible: Family Matters (trade paperback)
* book: Fletch
* cd: a mix of songs with Jesus in the title or lyrics
