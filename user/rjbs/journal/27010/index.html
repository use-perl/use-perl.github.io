<p>I had two weird dreams last night, capped off by a dream in which I was wondering what those two dreams meant.<br/><br/>In one, I was at a carnival with a lost of other Perl people.  We had won some free ride on something, and we all got in.  I'm not sure who was there, but it was a mix of Pobox people and Perl people.  I know Helen, Dieter, Damian, Allison, Jesse, and Chip were there.  (This is what I get for reading all those P6 meeting notes before bed.)  When the car rounded a corner, I saw that there was a loop coming up.  I said, "I don't do loops!" and hollered for the attendant to let me off, but she wasn't going to.  I jumped out of the ride while it was low to the ground, and she panicked: now it was unbalanced.  As the car went through the loop, the whole structure swayed to one side, then the other, and then broke apart, toppling over to the ground.<br/><br/>The fate of the riders was not made clear.<br/><br/>In another dream, I was arrested as responsible for the death of a police officer.  For my own protection, I wasn't kept in a holding cell, but I was locked in our car in the parking lot.  (The police station parking lot looked a lot like the gymnasium parking at Liberty High School; I'm glad, because the actual police parking lot is dark and underground.)  I was there for a long time while cops walked by, kicking the car, keying the car, or giving me dirty looks.  Eventually I went inside the building (into the school auditorium) and was booked and indicted.  I called my father to ask him to get me a lawyer, and he asked me to tell him that I hadn't done it.  "I didn't murder anyone," I said.  He didn't seem satisfied, so I added, "and I didn't cause anyone's inadvertant death."  This seemed to satisfy him.  I think my lawyer was my barber's cousin.  As the legal procedings went on, the BPD wouldn't give any details on what I was accused of, and we started to get the idea that the cop had died of a heart attack, and they were going to accuse me of having startled him somehow.<br/><br/>My third dream I remember the least; I was at work, except the office seemed to be a very tall, narrow structure.  Maybe it was a windmill.  Dieter got some new, critical service running and then had to go.  It was being run by a daemon that was re-run when needed by cron, and the way to keep cron from running certain of these services was to make a special DNS RBL entry or something. Fortunately I woke up before I looked at any of the code involved, because given the administrative stuff I was dreaming about, the code would have surely had me waking up in a cold sweat. </p>
