<p><p>Today, I got an instant message from Gloria saying, "Guess where I am!" She was at home, but also on the Internet.  It's pretty amazing what technology can do these days.  </p>

<p>The Covad Guy showed up today, and it seems like everything went swimmingly.  I got a phone call around 11:00.  It was The Covad Guy, saying, "I'm downstairs at your house."  "Oh," I said, "isn't anyone answering the door."  He replied, "Well, I'll actually be there in a minute or two."</p>

<p>I don't know what this call was for, but it reminded me of the creepy devil guy from Lost Highway.  "We've met before, at your house.  I'm there now.  Call me."</p>

<p>It was only minutes later that Gloria was online, and in just about an hour or so, I'll be online there, too.  Hopefully cheshirecat will come up soon thereafter, and my internet life will return to normal.</p>

<p>That will be a welcome change.  We're still only about half unpacked, and although we've made some progress toward figuring out where to put the books, the shelves are still lying on the dining room floor with all the boxed books. My office floor is covered with unfiled paperwork and junk.  There are still piles of things to get inspected or to fix, and I haven't synced my iPod in weeks.</p>

<p>I'm sort of anxious about all this, but I think I'm doing pretty well at maintaining a level head.  Kipling was right: keeping your head when all about you aren't, is always a good plan.</p>

<p>I'm hoping that all this upheaval and permanent interruptedness is going to serve as good practice, actually, because pretty soon things will be even more upheaved and interrupted.  Sometime in late March, I am scheduled to become a dad!  Actually, I'm already thinking of myself as one, but my current roster of fatherly duties are mostly enhanced versions of husbandly duties.</p>

<p>I really meant to set up baby.manxome.org a few weeks ago, but, well, I've been busy!  Now that we've got a connection at home, again, I think I'll get right on that. </p>
