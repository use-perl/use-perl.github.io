<p><html><p>I still have no phone.  Well, that&#39;s not true.  I have a really neat-looking
phone that I can&#39;t use yet.  T-Mobile assured me that I could go get a new SIM
from a place about a mile away, in town.  When I called that store today,
though, they told me that I&#39;d have to go to a T-Mobile corporate store, not a
&#34;satellite&#34; store.  In other words, six miles, to Whitehall, through traffic.
Forget that!</p><p>Hopefully my New Phone Drama ends tomorrow when I arrive in Philly and go to
the T-Mobile store just beside the bus stop.</p><p>American Express, continuing their tradition of excellence, has approved my
claim for laptop repairs.  Now I&#39;ll need to hand my laptop in for those
repairs, and hope like hell that I get it back before I have to head to
Pittsburgh next Friday.  I mean, I&#39;ll rent a MacBook from the repair place in
the meantime, but I&#39;d rather not take that with me to Pittsburgh and risk doing
something stupid to it.</p><p>Speaking of my Mac, I was recently thinking that I should turn on FileVault, as
I hadn&#39;t heard much about it going totally bugnuts lately.  I couldn&#39;t get it
working, though, and finally <a href="http://blog.innerewut.de/2005/05/13/apple-filevault-annoyances">found the
cause</a>.  Once
again, case-sensitive HFS users are screwed.  Maybe in the end, I&#39;m not even
getting any benefit from it.  It just seems to me like I should be able to have
a filesystem that acts like it should.  Unfortunately, even Apple doesn&#39;t seem
to think I matter, here.</p><p>On the flip side, work has been fairly productive, although not quite as
productive as I&#39;d hoped, this week.  I&#39;m hoping to find out that two problems
are already solved for me: how to use the Movable Type XML-RPC interface to
publish a post with tags, and how to sort a set of strings so that they&#39;re in
the same order as an arbitrary list of strings, only resorting to actual
comparisons if they&#39;re not.</p><p>That latter one might need to be coded, but should be easy.  Heck, maybe I&#39;ll
do it now while catching up on some TV.</p></html>
