<p><p>I actually did have some bad dreams a few days ago, but I can't remember what made them so bad.  I remember being told that I needed a haircut, but that's about it -- and I doubt that was especially traumautic.</p>

<p>This has been a mixed weekend.  On one hand, on both Saturday and Sunday I found myself hanging out at St. Nick's Greek Orthodox church with Gloria and other friends, eating delicious Greek food and relaxing.  I watched some good movies, ate some ice cream, and relaxed a bit.  On the other hand, various computer-related things are making me lose my hair.</p>

<p>On Saturday night, one of our few remaining not-quite-redundant servers went down, which led to a trip to our colocation facility.  It really wasn't so bad, except that it happened at all.  At least it means that one of our non-standard boxes will soon be history.  Also, it gave me a chance to have some diet Mountain Dew, which I haven't had in quite a while.</p>

<p>Both yesterday and today I've been working on Mail::Audit.  We use it quite a bit at work, and it's in the Phalanx 100.  A lot of people use it, but its behavior isn't very strictly defined, so I'm trying to figure out how much of its behavior is really relied upon.  I hate the idea of releasing a "bug fix" version of software that's been stable (or stagnant) for years, only to break a lot of people's email filters.  I'm fighting a few things: the interface and behavior aren't always well documented and are entirely untested; further, the existing undocumented behavior is sometimes clearly sub-optimal or just wrong. I really don't want to break existing code, but I also don't want to go ahead and document bad things.</p>

<p>What I really need is a formal deprecation schedule, but those aren't quite so useful when a module has been stagnant so long that people believe it's dead. It would be nice if there were a more uniform, universal way to alert module consumers to news.</p>

<pre>$ cpan-announce Mail-Audit "In six months, the 'noexit' feature will change."
</pre>

<p>Oh well.  For now, I think I'll stick to just documenting things... although I will probably make a list of things I want to change.  Is there some useful place I should post such a list, which I just can't think of? </p>
</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t it dead because it&#8217;s been superseded by <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Email-Filter/" title="cpan.org">Email::Filter</a cpan.org>? Hmm, I was going to say that that&#8217;s where I&#8217;d start with my own filtering efforts nowadays, but that looks quite dead too, with 2-year-old bugs in the tracker.</p>

<p>Anyway, how about just leaving inline notices that a behaviour may change when you document it, as well as adding to the TODO and/or BUGS AND LIMITATIONS sections in the POD?</p>

Right.  Like much of the "Perl Email Project," Email::Filter is languishing with open bugs and no real development.  I could migrate our code from one to the other, then implement the features that were dropped form Email::Filter, and then realize that Email::Filter is being ignored.<br><br>I feel that my employer and I are much better off starting with the inferior-in-code tools and improving them until they're as good.  Since we trust the maintainer (me), we don't need to worry about lists of ignored bugs.
