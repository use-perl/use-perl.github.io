<div class="span8">
<p>Very late in 2004, I made a list of things to do in 2005.  Basically, my new year's resolutions.  Let's review, shall we?<br/><br/>* only watch TV if I planned to see what's on<br/><br/>This went pretty well at first.  I got pretty good at avoiding the TV.  Then I got a TiVo, and I started watching huge amounts of Law and Order.  I've certainly backed off since then, but now I'm watching too many suggestions.  I need to cut back on things like King of the Hill and South Park.<br/><br/>So, this one was a qualified success, but will remain an area for improvement.<br/><br/>* write more prose and/or poetry<br/><br/>I didn't even try to do Nanowrimo, this year.  I have done a lot of writing-like work with the RPG I'm running.  I think I may just eliminate this goal, in the future, and maybe replace it with something like "do more letter-writing."<br/><br/>* learn enough Obj-C to write a Cocoa application<br/><br/>Ha!  No, this didn't happen.  I'd still like to learn to work on Cocoa, but it's just not very urgent.  Maybe if I had something specific I wanted to do, and I had a real need for it.  As it stands, this looks like a loser.<br/><br/>* keep a record of every book I read (and read more of them)<br/><br/>I'm not sure how I did, compared to last year, because I had no record of last year's reading.  I did start keeping a record, and frankly I'm disappointed in myself.  I need to up my pace and really plow through more books that I'm currently picking at.  If I replaced every hour of stupid TV watching with an hour of reading, I'd make some serious progress.<br/><br/>I'll take half credit on this one.<br/><br/>* go have a beer with a friend more often<br/><br/>I definitely did this more, this year, than last.  Still, not much.  I just need more local friends who actually have time to grab a beer now and then!<br/><br/>* get better at maintaining my own bicycle<br/><br/>Finally, a serious win!  I took a bike maintenance course at the Bethlehem Bicycle Co-operative, and it was loads of fun.  I got a certificate from the Park Tool School program, I took apart most of my bike and put it back together, I got a bike stand, and for Christmas I got a number of the tools I need.<br/><br/>Once the winter is over, I will try to do more riding and repairing!<br/><br/>* enroll in a Spanish course (if possible)<br/><br/>Again, I did it!  I took Spanish I and II, and I feel alright about how much I learned in just thirty hours or so.  I need to find a way to put my Spanish into use, though.  If nothing else, I should get my dad to speak more Spanish with me.  It's so very, very easy to be lazy about using a foreign language when you already share your native language with people.  I could speak German or Spanish with my parents, but they both speak English, so es dificil por mi no hablar ingles.<br/><br/>* learn to drive a car<br/><br/>Er, whoops.  My learner's permit expired, and I didn't renew it.  I really will get around to this, someday.<br/><br/>* cook and bake more often<br/><br/>Honestly, I think I did this less often than last year, and that's saying something.  I need to pick out some simple recipes and schedule my attempts to make them.  I am especially sad that I didn't try to make scrapple, this year, as I'd hoped to.<br/><br/>I still have the Joy of Cooking, which I got for Christmas last year and helped me feel good about making this resolution.<br/><br/>* be better about continually improving my software<br/><br/>I don't know... I'm certainly not anywhere near as good about it as I wanted to be.  I need to work on organizing my agenda better.  Keeping a real todo list seems impossible for me, as for many geeks.  I just can't find a planner that I like, be it hipster, RT, or Stickies.<br/><br/>So far, Stickies may be the best I've found so far.<br/><br/>That's it... I'll hopefully draw up my agenda for '06 before it gets here. </p>

<h2>Which RPG?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gizmo_mathboy/">gizmo_mathboy</a> on 2005-12-30T16:20:00</h3>
I'm in a 1st edition DnD campaign run by a co-worker.<br><br>I'm thinking about starting a Traveller game, maybe.

It's a setting of my own devising, using the d20 Modern rules.

<h2>* cook and bake more often</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/david.romano/">david.romano</a> on 2005-12-31T02:10:29</h3>
Cook, bake, and read more often are some of my unofficial TODOs.  A month ago, my brother suggested I read <a href="http://www.wwnorton.com/catalog/spring02/001183.htm" title="wwnorton.com">What Einstein Told His Cook</a wwnorton.com>, but I haven't gotten around to reading it quite yet. I heard good things tho', and it may be of interest to you as well<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
