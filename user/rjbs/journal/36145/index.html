<p><html><p>Yesterday, Kip (and the rest of his clan) came over and we finished Phase II of
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rjbs/sets/72157600335577475/">Project Better Back
Yard</a>.  I&#39;d already dug
up quite a bit of the earth around the two posts.  I was &#34;thrilled&#34; to find
that just beside the post nearer the house, there was <em>another</em> post!  It had
probably been cut off before the still-there post was planted, but I was still
gobsmacked.  It had a much more reasonable base, only a few inches across, and
the concrete was awful.  I broke out most of it with a hand sledge.</p><p>Kip estimated that each concrete anchor for the remaining posts would weigh
about four hundred pounds, and guessed that trying to remove them was just
asking for trouble.  I agreed.  We dug out a small trench beside each anchor
and laid them sideways and buried them about a foot underground.  I&#39;ll have to
make a note, on the deed, that future owners should beware.  Maybe I&#39;ll just
make a treasure map and hide it in the cistern in an antique scroll case.</p><p>Anyway, now the back yard is not totally flat, but it&#39;s all soil and grass on
top, so the next step is to get a roto tiller, turn everything over, flatten
everything out, and lay down new grass and plants.  Hopefully that will happen
in two weeks and then we&#39;ll have a yard that MJ can run around in and that
won&#39;t be the second-worst eyesore among all the shared yards in our lot.</p></html>
