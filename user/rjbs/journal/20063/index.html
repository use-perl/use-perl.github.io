<p>(Written yesterday around four something.)<br/><br/>I'm laid over in Chicago. I got into the airport just under an hour ago, and the gate for my next flight was directly across from my point of entry. I looked for something to eat, and the shortest line was to Uno's. I would have been willing to stand in line longer for something better, but everything seemed pretty fatty, so I ate my tiny pizza and did my best to enjoy it. I like Uno's crusts, and I've never quite understood how to describe it. It's not quite flaky, it's sort of powdery. But that sounds awful, and it isn't awful.<br/><br/>I kept wondering whether I should take my iPod's dock cable with me, and I finally decided, since I have a dock that will charge it. On the way here, though, I realize that I didn't have any way to iSync any updates to my contacts or calendars. Of course, I don't really believe that I won't be able to get my hands on a cable at OSCON.<br/><br/>I'm giving Stickies another try. I'm not sure if it'll last. OmniOutliner would be better for the way I use stickies, but I think it just won't look good in such a small window...<br/><br/>Having said that, I realized it would be easy to try it out. It looks OK, I think, and would look better with a little tweaking to the font used. Unfortunately, it seems that outlines don't save their window state with them, so it's no good. I could write a script, I suppose. It would probably be pretty ugly, though. Maybe I can squeeze some info on that need from an OO3 beta tester. I bet I can find one of those at OSCON, too.<br/><br/>There's no wireless network here, which is a shame. It seems like a pretty nice airport, I guess, and I was really hoping to have another go at releasing Module::Starter 1.25_02 -- the release script failed, ealier, and I wanted to get _02 up tonight, with an aim toward getting 1.40 really done early in the week.<br/><br/>I've been reading The Unix Philosophy on the plane. So far, it's quite good. I'd put it in the "things I already knew but am now seeing explained very well" box. I think I'll probably finish it this week, and I've brought A Quarter Century of Unix to read next.<br/><br/>It's about 17:25 on the east coast. Gloria probably already knows the results of her exam, but I don't want to call because she said she'd probably be in the class until 18:00, and I have this horrible image of her phone going off while she's being tested and distracting her. I know she's probably got the phone in a locker somewhere, but... well, I'll talk to her when I get to Portland!<br/><br/>The flight over here was really choppy. It wasn't severe turbulence, but I spent a lot of time with my stomach doing that "you just went up and down very quickly" thing. I hope the flight to PDX is smoother. I also hope United provides the same awesome thing on their entertainment system: air traffic control. I listened to ATC chatter all the way from PHL to ORD, and it was good background noise. Now and then I listened to it, and it was pretty interesting. I have some questions for someone who understands the lingo---or, more likely, for Google.<br/><br/>I'm going to close up and move closer to the gate. I think we'll be boarding in about ten minutes.</p>
