<p><p>I've gotten some mileage out of Facebook.  I caught up with a few old friends,
whom I otherwise would've never heard from.  That's about it.  I actually
appreciate that a lot, but the rest of Facebook can really just go to Hell.</p>

<p>First off, there's the fact that it doesn't seem to want to play well with
others.  I can't use my OpenID, I can't get an RSS feed of anything, and I
can't <em>really</em> shut off most of the obnoxious "your friend just took a quiz!"
alerts.</p>

<p>I can't convince non-technically-minded people that no, Facebook is not email.
I keep getting email from Facebook telling me I have a message from someone
else who has my email address.  Has Facebook become "The Internet" to some
people?  Ugh.</p>

<p>It could be worse, though.  I could just be getting "pokes."  Oh, or
"super-pokes."  This is a new kind of electronic communication whereby a friend
whom you haven't heard from in years sends you an email, but without any
content.  Instead you get a little message bar saying, "Long Lost Friend has
sent you a Beer.  Click here to send one back!"  Dude, you know what?  Why
don't you send me an <em>email</em> and I will buy you a <em>real</em> beer and we can eat
some tacos.  This "poke" stuff is rubbish.</p>

<p>Today and a few weeks ago, I logged in and saw a quiz that a friend wanted me
to take.  Normally I ignore these, but these two were both sort of interesting
and related to my friendship with this person.  Having gone throught the quiz,
I was then asked to "pick 20 friends to send this to."  There was a "Skip"
button, but clicking it brought up the error, "You must pick 20 friends."
Great.</p>

<p>I am not a huge fan of using Google for all my data needs, but I do have hopes
for the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/socialgraph/">Social Graph API</a> as a long
overdue means to show people that friendship network data need not live in
these walled city ghettos like Facebook, MySpace, Orkut, or, God save us,
Xanga.</p></p>

<h2>Facebooks is ads</h2>

Facebook has indeed become the internet to some people since its the easiest way to whitelist people who can send you messages.<br><br>Other than that, everything is designed to show you ads. That's why they want you on the site so much and force you to do things. It's not stupidity that you see, but purposeful design decisions that have other goals in mind.
