<div class="span8">
<p>I've been here at the Cardiff office for about six work days, now, and I think we've spent about eight work hours on the agenda items.  Six of those have been devoted to agreeing on standards, like "we should do source code control," and two have been in reviewing specific project roadmaps.  It's not as much as I wanted to do, but that's life. <br/><br/>A lot of my time has been spent on doing the things I'd be doing were I in the States.  That's not so bad, I suppose, but it's a PITA to do a lot of the things here that I usually do there. <br/><br/>Some fraction of my time, though, has been spent in teaching Perl to the two developers here.  Some of that has been, basically, through lecture.  I stand up and talk about scope and packages for a while and try to make sure that it's all clear and natural-seeming.  Some of that has been me looking over their shoulders while they work and helping them troubleshoot bugs.  I've found the whole thing quite enjoyable, and it makes me hunger more for doing some regular teaching of Perl.  I just need to find interested students! <br/><br/>I've gotten enough people with not-negative responses to the idea of ABE.pm, some of them even prospective learners, that I've finally filed the request to get it formed.  I need to find a place to meet and organize Meeting #0.  I am optimistic.  mdxi indicated that a 4-5 person meeting was good, so even that amount of turnout should be good here, too, I hope.  Really, I think a larger turnout is possible. <br/><br/>I got my first bug against one of my distributions on the CPAN, and this made me happy, since it gave me something I could feel compelled to do.  I rewrote some of the guts of Games::Goban to get away from the hash that had been storing the board and move to a array.  I realize that it may be slightly less efficient, but it just makes my life easier, especially now that the question of whether to skip 'i' in coordinants comes up.  It also reminds me that I should get Games::Board finished, then Games::Board::Grid, and then port Goban to that.  G::G::Image should also get worked on, especially now that the new Goban internals are more like those for which the diagrammer was first written. <br/><br/>I'm just a little embarassed to admit that I don't understand fully all the code in Games::Goban that Simon wrote.  Really, only the hash method confuses me.  I know what it's doing, but not how it's supposed to work.  Either it's flawed, or I am.  Once I bother writing something that uses it, I'll make the answer known.  I also mean to write something that uses the callback functionality, to see whether I like how it works.  Presumably that'll be one of my next TODO items, along with writing something to remove captured stones. <br/><br/>Also, being able to pass a move would be really good. <br/><br/></p>
