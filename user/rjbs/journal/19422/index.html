<p>I'm happy to be home! YAPC was a good experience, although I think OSCON was on the whole better, for a number of reasons. Most of them, though, boil down to location. The other tracks at OSCON, of course, meant that there was always something I found really interesting, but I mostly stuck to the Perl track. There were more people at OSCON, but I didn't have time to meet everyone at YAPC! Anyway, I'm glad I did YAPC, glad I'll be doing OSCON, and hope to keep on doing both.<br/><br/>Gloria and I have been chilling out together, watching Farscape, and drinking tasty white tea. We also watched some Jeeves and Wooster, which is strange, but very good. It's so... English!<br/><br/>I'm trying to keep my nose to the grindstone. Just as I did after OSCON, I'm feeling very motivated. I want a good portfolio. I want to solve good problems. I want to be known for being a useful member of the community. To this end, I've been working on a useless Acme::ProgressBar toy. Er!<br/><br/>Well, I'm also working on some other things. I've installed the new Kwiki, which looks totally awesome. I wrote a simple bit of code to format IRC-like blocks, and I'll eventually make it better. I need to learn more about Spoon, Spiffy, and Spork. I wish they had POD. Ingy says, "POD may be premature optimization," but I agreed with the dinner-table discussion from OSCON where it was said that "if the docs aren't in the POD, they become radically devalued."<br/><br/>Much love to statico, though, for producing examples for plugin-writing on new Kwiki Kwiki.<br/><br/>At work, I again considered rewriting MASH, but I'm just horrified at the idea of figuring out the right interface for everything it does. I need to identify the pieces that can be worked on one at a time. I wish I had more time to get things right at work. Or more people off of whom to bounce ideas. I haven't heard back from the newly Perl-enabled developer in the UK for a while. I wonder what's up.<br/><br/>I played a bit of Front Mission 4, this evening. It was totally awesome. The analog camera alone is an incredible improvement over FM3.<br/><br/>I'm going to stop writing now. More tomorrow.</p>

I have a progress indicator in subversion, which you can have a look at:<br> <br>http://cph.pm.org/svn/trunk/snippets/progress_indicator.pl<br> <br>VERY simple...<br> <br>hmm maybe I should do Acme::ProgressBar::Simple? - hmmm maybe not...<br> <br>jonasbn
