<p><h2>waste less time</h2>

<p>You know, I was doing pretty well with this for the first half of the year, or
so.  At some point, I got lazy again, and started losing a lot more time to
staring into space.  I've come up with a number of schemes for combatting
counterproductiveness, but I'm not sure that any of them are going to prove
particularly effective.</p>

<p>I'm hoping that once the baby is born, I can use whatever little free time I'll
have to relax productively (by writing a little code or prose) rather than
staring into space.  We'll see, though.</p>

<h2>read more</h2>

<p>I think I did pretty badly on this.  I stopped keeping track of how much
reading I did, and I really feel like I read twenty books or less in 2006.  I
have no doubt that I will have trouble doing a lot of reading in 2007, but I
hope I can at least keep a solid pace, constantly working through at least one
book at a time.</p>

<h2>learn more (computer) languages</h2>

<p>I'm not sure if I did much of this.  I've picked up a bit more Haskell and my
Ruby is better, but I didn't get around to doing as much Prolog or Lisp as I
wanted, and I didn't really learn anything new at all.</p>

<p>For yet another year in a row, I'll try to work on this, but I'm not sure it's
going to happen.</p>

<h2>use more (human) languages more often</h2>

<p>Yeah... total, utter failure here.  When family visited from Spain we just
didn't communicate.  I didn't really try to speak Spanish to them, I just
smiled and nodded and spoke through my father.</p>

<h2>learn to drive a car</h2>

<p>I really, really need to get on the ball about this.  I want to have my license
before the baby comes, and that will require quick work.</p>

<h2>buy a house</h2>

<p>Finally!  This one got done.  We bought our house in September and so far
neither the bank nor the government has tried to take it away.</p>

<p>I'll probably try to put together another todo list for 2007.  It will probably
be much more modest than previous years'.</p>
