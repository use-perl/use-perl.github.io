<p><html><p>I&#39;ve long been meaning to install a new operating system and services on my home server, cheshirecat. Mostly it only exists to host my big old RAID that stores ~rjbs, my MP3&#39;s, and a few other personal things. It used to host my website, the primary MX for manxome.org, and some other important things, so replacing it was going to be a pain. Still, it was running Slackware 7, dating from 1999, and it had only been patchily upgraded here and there.</p><p>Yesterday, I finally decided that I&#39;d give rebuilding it a go.</p><p>It was fantastically painless. I downloaded a Debian 4 net install ISO, added a little partition, and did a little floundering around until I got everything working. &#34;Everything&#34; here means, roughly: Samba, Apache 2 with SSL and SVN DAV, software RAID, LVM, and mounting my existing volumes.</p><p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll hit a couple little snags over the next few weeks, but all the important stuff is already taken care of. (Well, I haven&#39;t set up djbdns yet.) It&#39;s nice to know I can more easily remain up to date now, and worry about more interesting things.</p><p>As a side note: I&#39;ve been using BitTorrent, the original Python console client, version 4. Debian only has version 3, so I decided to take someone&#39;s advice and try rTorrent. Wow! It&#39;s fantastic. It&#39;s just about everything I always wished &#34;launchmany_curses&#34; would be. </p></html>
