It was amusing to hear one teller talk about &#34;deuces&#34; as if it was really common bank teller jargon and the other teller act like she had no idea was the first was talking about. Apart from that, nothing interesting has come of it yet. Today at Hogeez, the clerk gasped when I pulled out a bunch of them and paid with them. &#34;These are my favorites,&#34; she said, &#34;I collect them!&#34;</p><p>This was amusing, since I&#39;ve been talking a lot about the silliness of hoarding twos.

So far, I&#39;ve only circulated &#34;stealth&#34; Toms, but today I marked and sherlocked a bunch of them. I also looked over the bizarre <a href="http://www.wheresgeorge.net/dictionary.html">Encyclopaedia Georgetannica</a>, which lists a lot of the often weird WG slang. I think I will mostly avoid the forums. The people on the Where&#39;s George forums make <code>#perl</code> seem like just plain folk.</p></html>

<h2>$2 bills</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/scot/">scot</a> on 2007-04-22T02:57:30</h3>
Nice prank:)..I've thought about doing this myself sometimes but then I rarely go into a bank branch.  I've wound up with dollar coins as a result of buying stamps at the post office with a $20 and getting the change back in dollar coins. Sometimes cashiers have to take a second look when I've handed the dollar coins over.<br> <br><br/><br/>A company I used to work for once gave the standard Christmas bonus of $25 to all 2,500 employees in $2 bills as a publicity stunt to show the city where the company was located how much of the local economy was dependent on our company.  As an attention-getter, it worked:)...
