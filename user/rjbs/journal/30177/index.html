<p><p>Gloria decided, today, that I am so awesome that I deserve an early birthday present.  Who can argue with that kind of reasoning?</p>

<p>She gave me a DS Lite, which I turned on and oohed and aahed at.  It came with zero games, though, so she also consented to give me a lift to Game Crazy, where I picked up Meteos and Mario and Luigi.  Later on, we hit the mall and I picked up the New Super Mario Bros.  All of the games seem pretty boss.</p>

<p>I've added some other games to my wish list, but I'm in no hurry.  It'll take me plenty of time to work my way through these three.  Also, I should really update Games::Nintendo::Mario with more games, soon... well, after I'm done getting through the queue of PEP bugs. </p>

There are at least two ways to read this.  I think the intended way was: "Why not before, so you could play and show it off there?"  I think that was wise.  Even yesterday was 16 days early!  Beyond that, it meant that I was more prone to be social or productive there!<br><br>The other way to read this is, "She gave you that even after you were distracted for a few weeks and absent for a few days?"  Yes.  Yes, she did.
