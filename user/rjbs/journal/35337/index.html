<p><html><p>I&#39;ve been working on changing the way my mailflow works, mostly so that I can
benefit from the work that I do at Pobox.  In order to get rid of some of my
old email addresses, I&#39;ve been updating a <em>lot</em> of user accounts and list
subscriptions.  Today, as I&#39;ve started to get tax documents, I thought I&#39;d
update my TurboTax account.</p><p>I logged in, but couldn&#39;t find a link to change my email address.  I looked
through help and found a link to a page that didn&#39;t help.  I looked harder and
found step-by-step instructions.  The second step instructed me to click a link
that didn&#39;t exist.</p><p>I contacted the live web chat -- a feature that I&#39;ve grown pretty fond of,
these last few months -- and I got a link to their <a href="https://turbotax.intuit.com/support/ecr/form.jhtml">change of email
form</a>.  It includes the
following text:</p><blockquote><p>To process your e-mail change request, we require documentation that
establishes your identity. We can accept these documents via fax or as
digital scans. Any photo ID submitted should be clear enough to make out the
features of the person pictured in the ID. </p></blockquote><p>I started at this for a minute and then asked, &#34;So, I can&#39;t change my email
address if I don&#39;t own a scanner or fax machine?&#34;</p><p>My new friend, 03_Alfred Tamayo, said he&#39;d look into it, and then replied that,
&#34;Yes Sir, you should have a scanner or fax machine in order to send the
information, you can try it in some other computer who have that.&#34;</p><p>So... even though I have login credentials, and you&#39;ll give me all my past tax
information, and you&#39;ll send me commercial email.  You just won&#39;t let me change
<em>where</em> you send that email.</p><p>I will be using someone else to file my taxes this year.  Thanks, TurboTax!  Go
get bent!</p></html>

TaxActOnline will efile your 1040 for around $20.  The only caveat (according to some comparative reviews I read) is that they won't hold your hand as much as TurboTax.
