<p><html><p>I haven&#39;t made up my mind that I want an iPhone yet, but it really has a lot of
the <a href="http://rjbs.manxome.org/rubric/entry/1524">features that I want</a>.  It even
has the bonus feature of replacing my iPod.  Sure, it won&#39;t hold as much as my
40 gig (third generation) iPod, but it will be one less thing to put in my
pocket, and I was pretty happy using my 1 gig shuffle for most things, before I
lost it.</p><p>Since I wrote that entry, though, I&#39;ve had a few changes in what I want.  Over
and over, I&#39;ve found myself making notes on the backs of receipts or my hand.
Hours later, they&#39;re incomprehensible, or I&#39;ve thrown away the receipt.  (I
have not yet thrown away either of my hands.)  I realized that my (awful) phone
has a voice memo recorder, and it&#39;s pretty useful.  Why the heck doesn&#39;t the
iPhone?</p><p>Also, now that I&#39;m using <a href="http://hiveminder.com/">Hiveminder</a>, I&#39;d really like
to have AIM from my phone so I can talk to the AIM Hiveminder interface.  I can
do some nonsense to use SMS to use Twitter to send messages to Hiveminder, but
it&#39;s stupid and annoying.  I&#39;d rather have AIM on my phone.  Heck, my RAZR had
it.  Why doesn&#39;t the iPhone?</p><p>My current schedule for a next phone is &#34;once my T-Mobile contract is up.&#34;  I
forget just when that is, but it&#39;s June or July or so.  By then, I&#39;m hoping
that the SDK will have been out for several months, and there will be a wide
variety of third party applications for the iPhone, some available for free.</p><p>I&#39;m hoping to see an AIM client (Adium would be nice!) and a memo recorder, of
course.  I&#39;d also really like to see a ssh client, although I&#39;m not sure how
useful it will be.  The iPhone keyboard sucks, and I don&#39;t really want to have
to use the iPhone to enter passwords or ssh key passphrases.  Still, being able
to fix a busted MX remotely from a movie theater lobby would be great.</p><p>I&#39;d like a good RSS reader, but it will need to sync with my laptop.  I use
NetNewsWire for reading RSS now, which can sync to the NewsGator service.  When
that feature first started, it seemed to be buggy.  I&#39;m hoping it will be
better now.  Even if it&#39;s still a little twitchy, I won&#39;t mind a few little
glitches once in a while, if it mostly works.</p><p>Having to use some weird app to put text files on iPhone seems annoying, but I
think I effectively need to do that now, if I can get arbitrary text on there
at all.  I&#39;d like a way to get <code>random.txt</code> onto my iPhone for viewing on the
road.</p><p>I&#39;m not sure what else I want to see come out of the SDK.  I wouldn&#39;t mind my
long-desired ability to write procmail for incoming calls.  (Work is calling?
at 03:00?  Don&#39;t ring!)  I&#39;d love the ability for third parties to write better
input methods, because the iPhone virtual keyboard stinks.  I hate to say it,
but Flash would be nice for mobile Safari, especially if we get 3G in the next
rev.  Mostly, I want to run Pandora.</p><p>I&#39;ll be astounded if iPhone Safari gets a 1Password plugin, but that would be
great.  Getting iStumbler would be amusing, but not really useful for me.</p><p>I think that the things I&#39;m looking for are pretty simple.  It will probably
come down to the ability of free software developers to get the SDK and
distribute applications built with it.  I guess we&#39;ll know more about that on
Thursday.</p><p>When will we find out about buying an Android phone?</p></html>

<h2>3rd Party Apps</h2>

There is already a considerable amount of third party software available for the iPhone.  I too have been considering getting one.  You can find AIM, SSH, RSS readers and I haven't looked but I'd also guess voice recorder software.  There are rumors of a version of Adium for iPhone.

I don't want to have to jailbreak my phone.

I must have missed that in the original post.  Well, there are web apps that give you AIM and SSH although I don't know if I'd trust them.

I might trust a web AIM, but definitely not a web SSH.  I'll wait for the SDK!

<p>It sounds like they&#8217;ll tie 3rd party apps to the iTMS with an approval process. They probably won&#8217;t allow anything that would subvert any of the their or their telco partners&#8217; income sources.</p>

<p>(Hey, slowly turning from a technology company into a content distributor was a huge boon for Sony&#8230; cough.)</p>

There are a lot of conflicting rumors right now.  I am content to wait a week and find out.

<h2>Looked at Jott?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/clayton/">clayton</a> on 2008-03-03T15:25:04</h3>
I use Jott to create Hiveminder tasks when I'm away from a computer (http://www.jott.com).<br/><br/>It's not perfect, but it works well enough that I know what I was trying to remember.

That looks like a good idea.  I'd heard about Jott before but I didn't have a use case at the time.  I'll give it a spin.  Thanks!
