<p><html><p>Here are my examples of hateful web interface from today.  I have been looking at getting an EVDO device to replace using my RAZR as a modem.  This led me to poking around on the websites of both Sprint-Nextel and Verizon.</p><p>I spoke with a Sprint rep in a web chat.  I was annoyed when it tried to be smart and resize my main (many-tabbed) window to fit a new window beside it, a la the horrible Help feature introduced in, I think, Microsoft Office XP. The sales guy was helpful, though, and I made a few notes and then loaded some pages to look at on Verizon&#39;s web site.</p><p>Then, Gloria and I ran off to see the Halloween remake.  It was okay.</p><p>When I got back, I had about a dozen JavaScript &#34;alert&#34; windows to click through.  Why?  Each tab at Verizon&#39;s site had three: &#34;You&#39;re about to time out!&#34; twice, then &#34;You timed out!&#34;  Why the hell are you telling me this, Verizon?  My session browsing your phone catalog timed out?  So what?</p><p>The most obnoxious part is, as far as I could tell, it kept throwing up more of these, once those were cleared.  Look, I just wanted to leave the tab there for future reference.  It wasn&#39;t some sort of online banking, it&#39;s an online cellular phone catalog.  This, combined with the fact that none of their USB EVDO devices listed OS X support, led me to write Verizon off.  (I was also annoyed to see that they offer the same Sierra 595U that Nextel does, but they don&#39;t list it as a Mac OS device.  This suggests that they won&#39;t support this configuration, so they can go screw.)</p><p>Sprint&#39;s only major crime had been the stupid web chat thing, which only required me to resize my main window once... until I went through checkout.</p><p>First, they ask for my main and alternate phone numbers.  I entered my main phone number and left the other blank.  It forced me to redo the form: &#34;If you only have one phone number, enter it twice.&#34;  What?!</p><p>Later, it wanted me to enter yet another phone number, to decide in what area to give me a new phone number.  (I have no idea why my modem needs a number, but whatever.)  Why didn&#39;t it default to my current number?  Who knows.</p><p>Hopefully, I will get my modem on Tuesday and find out that it&#39;s ridiculously fast, like (I think) Crome&#39;s was at YAPC.  I will keep it, and start pondering the expense of moving our voice phones to Sprint.  I will be pretty bummed out if, after all this, it does me no good.</p><p>Actually, what I&#39;m really wondering is whether it will keep a good EVDO signal all the way from Bethlehem to Philadelphia on the highway. </p></html>
