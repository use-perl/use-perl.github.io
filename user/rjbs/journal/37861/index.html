<p><html><p>We&#39;ve been unhappy with the performance of some code, recently.  I was pretty
sure I knew where the problem was, but I thought I&#39;d run NYTProf just to see
how things looked.  I&#39;m running an older NYTprof, so it&#39;s not 100% clear that
my SQL-level optimization is what I need to do -- but it&#39;s the right thing to
do anyway.  Anyway, I figured I might see something sort of interesting, but I
never expected this:</p><pre>Calls     InclTime   ExclTime     Subroutine
 27,908        406        406     DBI::st::execute
543,412         79         31     Carp::caller_info
</pre><p>...and let&#39;s not go any further.  The program took almost exactly 600s to run.
Of that, nearly five percent was because the program called <em>Carp</em>, and it
called it <em>a half million times</em>!  <strong>What?!</strong></p><p>I won&#39;t be coy, because I&#39;m writing this while waiting for a test suite to run
and while watching House.  It turns out that it was related to this line:</p><pre>Calls     InclTime   ExclTime     Subroutine
139,340        222          6     SUPER::get_all_parents
</pre><p>That subroutine looks like this:</p><pre>sub get_all_parents {
  my ($invocant, $class) = @_;

  my @parents = eval { $invocant->__get_parents() };

  unless ( @parents ) {
    no strict 'refs';
    @parents = @{ $class . '::ISA' };
  }

  return 'UNIVERSAL' unless @parents;
  return @parents, map { get_all_parents( $_, $_ ) } @parents;
}
</pre><p>See how it calls <code>$invocant-&#62;__get_parents</code>?  Well, that&#39;s great, except that
our internal ORM has an AUTOLOAD subroutine that looks like this:</p><pre>sub AUTOLOAD {
  my $self = $_[0];
  my $class = (ref $self) || $self;
  (my $method = $AUTOLOAD) =~ s/.*:://;
  return if $method eq "DESTROY";
  unless (blessed($self)) {
    confess qq(AUTOLOAD: \$self for ->$method is not a blessed reference: )
      . Dumper($self);
  }

  ...
}
</pre><p>Now, to avoid hitting the database too much, we have a mixin that makes it talk
to a memcached.  That mixin (like many such modules) uses SUPER.pm.
SUPER then calls <code>__get_parents</code> on our ORM, but hits the <code>AUTOLOAD</code> instead,
and since that&#39;s only supposed to work on objects, it confesses.  It does this
every time we check consider using a cached copy of an object, causing us to
invoke <code>Carp::confess</code> a half million times.</p><p>The solution?  I added this line to our ORM:</p><pre>sub __get_parents { return; }
</pre><p>Shaved two minutes off the test case.  That&#39;s about 20%.</p></html>

<p>I could patch SUPER to call <code>$invocant-&gt;can( '__get_parents' )</code> before calling it in the eval, but this seems like a corner case.  I'll think about it.</p>

<p>I thought about that a little bit myself.  It's definitely a corner case, but it can (demonstratedly) be a pretty serious benefit.  Then again, "can" is a lying jerk and it means more overhead for all the code that would've worked just fine otherwise...</p><p>I think the best solution might just be for people to STOP USING AUTOLOAD... at least when it's not really the right (read: only) way to do something.  This was clearly a gratuitous use of AUTOLOAD.</p><p>If you patch SUPER, though, I won't mind one bit!</p>

<blockquote><div><p> <em>Then again, "can" is a lying jerk and it means more overhead for all the code that would've worked just fine otherwise...</em></p></div> </blockquote><p>People who don't override <code>can</code> when necessary are like people who don't check the return calls of system calls.  Sure, you hope things will go right, but if you want to play nicely with the rest of the system, you ought to be a good neighbor.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s true. However, it doesn&#8217;t alter the conclusion: if you can avoid <code>AUTOLOAD</code>, you should. It is much like <code>eval</code> and <code>goto LABEL</code> in that regard.</p>

<p>People who override can when they think it necessary almost always get it wrong.  But we've had this discussion before.</p>

<p>Yes, we have, and you're still wrong to suggest that people break the way Perl objects work because you don't think they're smart enough to do it right.</p><p>I think we can all agree that <code>AUTOLOAD</code> is overused, and often poorly.</p>

<p>Considering how many competent programmers I have seen try and fail, I think the ball is in your court to demonstrate that it is both possible and likely enough to happen that it is worth insisting on.</p>

I favor adding a call to can() here.<br/><br/>I think the outcome would be less surprising. "__get_parents()" does not strike me as the kind of method which would intentionally be served through "AUTOLOAD", so I would say "can" is likely to return accurate result for it.
