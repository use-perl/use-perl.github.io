<p><html><p>The canonical source for my journal posts is at rjbs.manxome.org in my Rubric install.  Rubric doesn&#39;t do comments, though, and I am really, really not interested in adding that feature.  That&#39;s why I syndicate to use.perl.org.</p><p>use.perl, though, seems to have increasing bouts of downtime, and its interface seems to me to be getting weirder, although maybe I&#39;m just getting old.  Also, I wouldn&#39;t mind being less totally marked as &#34;blog about perl.&#34;  I&#39;ve been looking at other blog software or services.  Blogger seems pretty cool, but I haven&#39;t been able to produce an Atom file that it&#39;s willing to accept as an import of old posts.</p><p>I&#39;ve used MT before, and it seems like it&#39;s way overkill.  Also, last I checked, there was no way to use the API to make posts that had tags.  Vox just seems noisy and busy.  LiveJournal is ugly, no matter how it get styled.</p><p>Still, nothing is going to be awful enough to get me to add more blogging feature to Rubric. </p></html>
