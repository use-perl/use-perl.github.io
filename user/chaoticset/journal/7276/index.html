<p>First, I got started gutting petdance's start page (linked a while back in his journal here) for my very own twisted purposes.  Fast going, once I figured out what was going on.
<P>
Next, I decided to work on a Log module (even though another one probably exists) because I figured it would be good practice for writing modules for CPAN, even if I never send it there.  The intended function for it is to import the function log:
<P>
<CODE>
log('text to log');<BR>
log(<EM>lognumber</EM>, 'text to log');<BR>
log({ <EM>lognumber</EM> => "<EM>filename</EM>" });
</CODE>
<P>
where the first is the simplest usage, the second is usage with switchable log files, and the third is the syntax for designating the filename for a switchable log file.
<P>
The part where it's a total ripoff is that I want the use Log; part of the module to switch all the log() functions on and off, as in
<P>
<CODE>
use Log qw('on');<BR>
use Log qw('off');
</CODE>
<P>
which is pretty much just a batch of functionality I've been implementing myself, with a variable set to 0 or 1 and a print statement wrapped inside an if and an open statement wrapped inside the same if.  I just figured it would save me typing.
<P>
I toyed briefly with the notion of looking around, because I'm sure that CPAN has a much better logging module somewhere, but like I said, this is practice, and what the hell.  Even if I'm the only person who ever uses it, it'll help me on little things that only <EM>I</EM> would ever see.</p>

<h2>My start page</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2002-08-24T17:30:31</h3>
What did you do with <a href="http://www.petdance.com/start/" title="petdance.com">my start page</a petdance.com>?  I'm curious to know.
<p>
Of course, it's autogenerated so it's not the same start page as when you started poking at it last.  Maybe I'll link to the source code somewhere.</p>

I noticed that it was generated, but I worked from a static copy, just finding the notion of such a thing highly useful.
<p>
Most of it was removing tools I didn't use, topics I wasn't particularly interested in, and adding several news sites.  That plus a few changes to the stylesheet that I happen to find readable but probably everyone else will find disgusting<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  The link is <a href="http://chaoticset.perlmonk.org/start" title="perlmonk.org">here</a perlmonk.org>.  Oh, and it's very nasty HTML right now -- I didn't attempt to improve readability anywhere except where I made modifications or removed things, left a bunch of stuff commented out, and built the search tool for Plastic.com but will probably never uncomment it.  Plastic requires a login before you can search.  I may make a login tool off the start page for it, next best thing.
</p><p>
It's really rough, and right now perlmonk.org appears to be down.</p>
