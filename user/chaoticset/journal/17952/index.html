<p>Looking at <a href="http://www.ghg.net/clips">CLIPS</a> for some Expert System needs I might be having shortly.
<p>
The docu so far indicates that it can be used as an embedded system in a larger application, which is what I would need, so that's a good sign.</p>

<h2>CLIPS and Expert systems</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/n1vux/">n1vux</a> on 2004-03-18T23:40:44</h3>
CLIPS is a great old system. If it suits your needs, hey, great. It's old but it's government copyright freeware and it works.  There are much newer commercial tools for C/C++/Java worlds.
I'd love to hear how Perl -MClips wrapper works -- last I saw on CPAN it was still in development stages, not available?  If you need speed, CLIPS could be the way to go, but you may have to do use C or wrap it yourself.

<p>This is of course all assuming that forward-chaining and not backward-chaining is what you need. (Commercial CLIPS/R2 has backward chaining and C++ as well, but CLIPS 6.x is backward only. ECLIPS had backward chaining, but I don't know if it's available.)
</p><p>If you don't need speed, just expresivity, why not Perl6::Rule? Maybe because it's not done yet. Conversely, Language::Prolog is over-done, un-maintained.

</p><p>
If you're doing an expert systems project, you should have someone on the project that's done such work before to avoid re-inventing past dead-ends.  If you haven't and don't have such a person, I can refer you to friends who were in the field long before my dabbling days.
