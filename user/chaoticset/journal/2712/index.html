<p>The title seemed inappropriate after a few hours' contemplation.
<P>
The Zip disk that I had a working ActiveState perl on barfed when one of the lab machines crashed.
<P>
After I rebooted, it was like D-Day in there.  Pod strewn in with code strewn in with binary strewn in with pure text.
<P>
Everything, and I do mean everything, got dumped into several thousand file fragments.  I managed to search out the ever-important log files (so that I can remember who the hell I've been talking to the past week and what the hell I said to them) and save my homework (a twiddly little homepagey thing, but I liked the layout and didn't want to do it over).  I could save nothing else.
<P>
The upshot of this is that, once I get home, I have to give the Zip disk a thorough going over.  This is the third time it's given me trouble; last time I managed to save perl.  I don't want to do this again.
<P>
This also means I can't play with Perl before I have to leave in an hour or so.  Too bad; I'm starting to understand some of the docs I printed out.  I may go search up a few more and print them out while I'm still at the lab.
<P>
I want out of this Windows thing.  I just have to be patient; in a year or so I suspect I can make the transition somewhat flawlessly, games and all.
<P>
Tomorrow is an open book, except for Rent Payment Time, so I'll probably try to get a bunch of OO fiddling done.</p>
