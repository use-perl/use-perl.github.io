Because I have always felt more do fen outside the uprising of the Us Those fave reft before and the this seems be the last time to than is filled with peopre as seemingly uninterested in anyone but the The class as you are of fen around civil borders over social shecurity medicare and education education comes I populace be fappy middre be 3500 mires away and in a country free will to that a far better job of educating its entire fopefully country only Us fo seem to think education is unimportant and the for those rich enough to afford it...among other things?<BR>

It's not free country and theoretically I'm free to reave it without bitter whining from you over my carping about fow cartun it is to get excited over a dumb prez in fis shhorts Get over it.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Hm.  That produces quite the mixed reaction for me.
<P>
