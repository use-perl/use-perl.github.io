<p>I have been commanded to stay home by my well-meaning SO, and I'm certainly not going to argue with her.
<P>
I've finished my half-gallon of orange juice, I'm getting as much rest as possible (I mean, cursing at Nethack -- it's only <EM>using a keyboard</EM>, it's not like I'm thinking or using an XBox controller or something), and I've got a pint of Karamel Sutra in the fridge, a getting-sick present.  The day promises to be lazy and uneventful.
<P>
Painfully so.  I can't seem to shut off that voice in my head that keeps saying I should be <EM>doing</EM> something, for the sake of all that is Humanity.  I'll probably shut it up by reading my C++ book.  :\
<P>
I <EM>should</EM> be working out the design for Owl And Dash (tentative name (good thing, too, 'cos it sucks)), which is the news site I want to build.  (No, this wouldn't be a <EM>real</EM> news site, just work to demonstrate that I can actually build a dynamic site.)
<P>
So I'm going to stop this constant Depeche Mode morning and get myself some nice coffee and attempt to work out the guts of what I'm doing with OAD.
<P>
(I was thinking perhaps an anagram of something else -- how about Waste, Blade, And Torso?)
<P>
Eh.  Never was good with names.  My final project in my Perl class was the forerunner of this thing, and it was called <EM>Newser</EM>.  :(</p>
