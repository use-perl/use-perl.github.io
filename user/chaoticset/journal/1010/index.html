<p>I always feel so guilty for not doing something productive in a whole day, but I did it.  _Perfect Dark_, in case you've heard of it.  (I'm borrowing an N64, because I wouldn't really want to *own* one of those things.)
<P>
I found my cap, the one I always wore to my old tech support job and stopped wearing when I got laid off.
<P>
I don't think about the place much, but when I do, it's with vague disgust, as if the milk I'm drinking was sour and I didn't notice until I finished the glass.
<P>
I didn't get any work done with the CGI yet, but I'm hoping to do some today before my 4:00 class.
<P>
The thought has occurred to me that it would be really dandy to just build the other web pages on the fly too - set it up so the whole site is controlled by one CGI script.
<P>
That thought was immediately followed by, "And you think you know how to do that because...?"
<P>
Yeah, I could implement that.  But it would push things back, so I shouldn't.  Consider it gravy to add to the meat after I've learned to cook the meat properly; I'll get it to do that later.
<P>
For now...it just needs to generate one page of singles for Magic, have checkboxes next to each one, and if any are clicked when you push the 'put in my cart button', drop those into the cart and update the stock file.
<P>
It needs to generate invoices that can be printed later (I figure a directory of invoices is the easiest way to do it, just number 'em and drop 'em into that directory).
<P>
It also needs to clean up old cart files that are just sitting around after, say, twenty minutes if someone abandons them.
<P>
It also needs to check credit card numbers and make sure they *look* right at least.
<P>
Crap.  I forgot all about that...the client is looking for a CC verification if possible.  I don't believe there's any free way to implement that...
<P>
Time for more research.
<P>
(Well, some research.  Then I have to read a chapter in the book for my class.)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Quick Addendum:  It just occurred to me that there may be a much easier way to do this.  Once I get all the pricing stuff fixed, and there's just the *one* file, stock.txt, there's not all that much to do with the data, really.
<P>
Perhaps, if I look around, there's already a cart system that can work with all this.
<P>
Perhaps not.  (Ideally, this system works with the names of the cards.  People come to the site and can look at the whole list, or they can type the first few letters and get *just* the cards with those first few letters...I don't think any cart programs exist for that yet.)
<P>
On the other hand, I found a great place to resell the hosting of if I become a real wacko and start doing "web design".
<P>
*sigh*
<P>
I love Perl, but I don't know if I can make money at it, and money is a nice thing to have.  Especially when you need Little Debbies.  Y'know?
<P>
Yeah, you know.
