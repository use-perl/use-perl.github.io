<p>Didn't get one thing done.
<P>
Well, that's not quite true.  I updated myself on all the new journal entries; I browsed the fine selection of intelligent conversations/posts at the Monastery; and I took a few minutes to examine Junkies and Fu.  That is, <A HREF="www.javajunkies.org">that place</A> and <A HREF="www.javafu.com">that other place</A>.  (I'm surprised they didn't call it javajitsu.  javafu was probably a little more intuitive.)
<P>
Also, something occurred to me:  I read that when the Writers' Guild strike of many years occurred, several TV shows and promising movies tanked, because they couldn't get decent writers.  The decent writers, unwilling to cross the picket line, ended up working on pet projects and new things they'd wanted to try.  When the strike ended, new, lovingly-crafted scripts flowed into offices.  Freelancers became a viable commodity because of this event.
<P>
I wonder what open source will look like in a few years, now that people are being pushed out of their tech-jobs and have no other outlet for their software notions.
<P>
I have half an hour to be ready to leave for the SOTF's birthday lunchy thing.  (My parents are taking us out.  Their suggestion, probably due to me and the SOTF never seeming to have spare funding.)
<P>
I want to bring the Lisp chapter with me.  Is that so wrong?  ;)</p>
