<p>I don't quite get regexes.  I know that now.
<P>
I started checking output; my problem earlier was one I'd noticed and forgotten...the last line in any file gets crapped for some reason I don't fully comprehend.  Now hitting enter one last time before I save; problem fixed.
<P>
The test runs I've done so far indicate that changes done on a per-sentence basis will be too homogenous, too odd.  Working on operating on individual words now.
<P>
Can't wait to see _Blue Velvet_ now; I like Laura Dern too.  I didn't know anybody was in the movie except Hopper and someone else I can't remember the name of currently.

Quick Addendum:  <A HREF="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?lastnode_id=144674&node_id=144901">This</A> doesn't seem like such a terrible idea to me, but then again I don't know if there's some twiddly-bit-style problem with it, or even if it's a desirable thing for the person who'd have to do it.  :)  Now that I'm thinking about it...what about a use.perl; nodelet at the Monastery?
<P>
There's probably already one.  I'm off to check.
<P>
Today's agenda includes pretty much just the Engrish.  I'm going madly through _Bookshelf_, finding anything on regexes I can and going over it, looking for helpful switches and patterns and whatnot.  By the end of the day, I should have a much better control over the text mods.

Problem on the last line, eh?  I wonder if you've got a hidden ^Z at the end.  I remember that causing some bizarre behavior back in my Air Force days.
<p>
Try an 'od' to see if there are any hidden characters
</p><p>
As for Laura Dern, you can also get an eyeful in <i>Wild at Heart</i>.  It's also a Lynch flick.  Been a long time since I saw it, but I seem to recall enjoying it.</p>
