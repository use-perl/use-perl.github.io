<p>I've hit the point where I can't seem to stay focused on my coding, and I know that this is the thing that destroys people who want to move from the level of 'hobbyist' to 'professional' in anything -- the ability to keep going when it's boring/tedious/difficult.  Read about it when I was learning how to write, barely squeaked past it (which is to say, I have difficulty with it but it's not impossible), now I've got to try to learn past it all over again.
<P>
Doesn't help that there's a wealth of information out there; it's so easy to get distracted these days.  Sometimes I long for the time I spent with a computer when I did <EM>not</EM> have net access.
<P>
Anyways, Googling around and visiting a few of my old haunts reminded me that <A HREF="http://www.waferbaby.com/howto/beinstitutionalized/">I once thought I was funny</A>, that <A HREF="http://server146.jiffynet.net/user/classicd/b985/bif.981021gba.txt">I left the game I loved so much</A>, that <A HREF="http://5050.blogspot.com/"> and that I used to keep a fairly regular blog</A>.
<P>
Nostalgia.  I can't decide what to be nostalgic about at this point -- the days that I had no net access and it was easier to force myself to learn how to code, or the days when I was able to manage being a full-time student and had lots of free time to do whatever I felt like with.
<P>
I'm sure I'll figure it out soon.  And, hopefully, push past the last parts of the fuzzy module as well.  Maybe some more drawing of the problem will help.</p>
