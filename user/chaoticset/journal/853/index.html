<p>Oh, okay, so I forgot I had a test in my network class.
<P>
Anyway, while I've got network access, I figured I'd drop a few notes in here.
<P>
It suddenly has occurred to me that it might have been a hell of a lot easier to have a different separator for the name and the rest of the data (especially if I ever roll this whole bunch of files together into one huge combined inventory/cost file).
<P>
I think I have an idea of how to do this.  A search in the <B>Perl Cookbook</B> (now that I have the <B>CD Bookshelf</B> version, it's so friggin' easy) revealed that I can dump arrays into hashes.  If I make the name of the card the key and the rest of it as a two-element array, I think my problems are over.  I can sort with that, I can do pretty much all I need to do with it.  (And, despite my whining, I can still work around the problem of my separators.  s/// is supposed to be greedy, so I'll do a match for the first string that is a bunch of letters and then a colon, rip that out of the string...no, wait, the best way to do it would be to make it a step in reading the file:  Rip each line into three parts, then map that three-element array into one key and one (two-element array) element in the hash.  Once that's all mapped, working with the hash itself should be pie.
<P>
I hope.
<P>
I guess I'm officially back on track; most of what I'm doing tonight is going to be scribblework, not typingwork, so I probably won't post tonight.  Got a 7:00 class tomorrow morning.  7:00-9:45 is Discrete Math and then 10:00-11:20 is Statistics.  Four hours of nearly continual math, math, math.  No wonder I need all that Dew.
<P>
Oh, and I have something to scribble *on* now.  I can go through a legal pad in about a month, so I've upgraded:  I bought a smallish dry-erase board, something I can carry around with me and use like a pad.  (Well, except I can't look through my scribbles.  Gotta be careful about keeping good things when they come up.)  It was over at Staples for ten bucks; worth it, when your legal pad expenses in a year are well into the double digits.
<P>
Well, back to the drawing board.  ;-)
