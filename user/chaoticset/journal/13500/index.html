<p>Okay.  Last night you got the refresher checking if the perljobs RSS feed was fetched within the last 30 minutes, and if not, fetch a new one.  (It's likely that the program will be used infrequently enough, so this will reduce the amount of fetching to something reasonable, hopefully.)
<P>
You also wrote the MW for the Tk, but not really much else.
<P>
Right now, your main problem is that the detailed feed coming out of perljobs is giving "not well-formed" errors when XML::Simple looks at it, and similar errors when IE tries to look at it.  Have to figure out what I'm doing wrong with the RSS feed.  (The normal one didn't seem to have issues, but you only looked at it once or twice.)
<P>
Figure out something with this, even if it means using XML::Parser.
<P>
Work out the rest of the Tk, too.  Think about using the Form manager this time.  Pack's quick, but kind of unwanted.  Eh, we'll see.</p>

If XML::Simple has trouble with it, likely so will XML::Parser.
<p>Two options you should look into first:
</p><ul>
<li>characters: does the data contain any invalid characters? Does the character set agree with the content-encoding? The default for XML is UTF-8.</li>
<li>Proper, matched nesting of tags.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, the error message as produced by XML::Parser, should give you a very specific pointer, line and column numbers, to where it thinks the first error occurs. I don't know if XML::Simple is as explicit.</p>

XML::Simple's been dumping XML::Parser's errors at me most of the time.  (I can't recall right now whether or not this error's been from Parser or Simple, but I can check it easily when I get home.)
<p>
I was under the impression that XML::Simple really just tells XML::Parser to do the most obvious thing and hope it works, but if the well-formedness is truly in question, perhaps I should figure out what's going on.  Now I've just got to learn more about RSS and fetch my XML handbook, and perhaps I can actually do it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
