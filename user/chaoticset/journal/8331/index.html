<p>I need to sit down and write a batch file on my home system that prompts between 'perl makefile.pl', 'make', 'make test' and 'make install'.  It'd be nice if it dumped all the output from these things into a file called, say, modulename.inst or something.  Noodle that around later when I get home.
<P>
The censor-app has been getting forgotten, what with me working my "real" job.  A lot of call centers apparently already have pay-for-performance plans in place, but ours just switched, so I've been concentrating extra hard on trying to make sure I don't get a huge pay cut.  Whee.  I need to find a better job, is what that means.  (Of course, they've lost a significant chunk of employees, so it's faintly possible that they'll drop the PFP.  Really really faintly.)
<P>
I need a <A HREF="http://www.diskonakey.com">disk on a key</A>, and I want it big enough to contain PFE, Perl, and a big swath of current CPAN modules, dammit!  It's nothing I can afford now, but I'm hoping Christmas will bring it, or else that I'll have a better job by then and could afford it.
<P>
I haven't been able to attempt to work on the scheduling tool, mostly because I'm waiting to find more things that provide necessary functionality, and part because I've been way too busy to work more on it.  Next week should be even worse.  :\
<P>
Busy but happy.  Best kind of busy.  :)</p>
