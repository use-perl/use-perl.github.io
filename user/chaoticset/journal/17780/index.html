<p>R's grandfather passed away yesterday morning at something around 6 in the morning.  I'm fuzzy on the time because I was sleeping when her father called to tell us (she's normally home then as well), and I didn't fully wake up.
<p>
Tuesday is the viewing.  The family's eschewed a funeral in favor of private time.
<p>
I didn't know him that well, so it would seem disingenuous to write about him.  Everyone will miss him.
<p>
I've spent much of the week away from work and geekery, sitting in a room with people who are trying to keep themselves from crying.  I can't help but metacomment that I feel useless in such a situation.
<p>
I'm not sure what it's going to be like seeing the body.  I've only ever been to one other funeral that I remember, for a girl who was killed in a car accident at least ten years ago.  </p>
