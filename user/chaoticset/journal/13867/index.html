<p>Ah, finally -- a handy list to act as a rule of thumb:
<OL>
<LI>Pick the most important/frequent thing that your module does/needs to do 
<LI>Frame it as a simple story about whatÃ¢â¬â¢s happening 
<LI>Recast that simple story as test code 
<LI>Make the tests pass 
<LI>Refactor 
<LI>If you havenÃ¢â¬â¢t run out of time/money/features to add, goto step 1.

It's from the Perl Angst article mentioned elsewhere (yes, I'm currently too lazy to link.)
<P>
That's not why I'm <STRONG>nervous</STRONG>, though.  I'm nervous because someone I called about a week ago concerning a job at <A HREF="http://jobs.perl.org/">perl jobs</A> <EM>called me back</EM>.
<P>
I went to the Bangor State Fair tonight.  (No, Bangor's not a state, and I'm pretty sure that the state it's in (Maine) has more than one state fair.)  It sprinkled a little rain, it showed me a bunch of rides I loved when I was a foot shorter, it tipped me off to the existence of corn dogs <EM>one foot long</EM>.  (Oh, happiness.)  They had pretty good blooming onions, too, so I was mostly happy with the food.  Better than I expected.  I didn't go on any rides or play any games, because, well...ech, I was pinin' all day long for code.
<P>
This morning, I looked over CGI::Application::Generator's documentation and some interesting ideas have come to mind.  I really want to do something interesting with it, but instead I'll do the thing I believe I'm capable of.  The thing that bugs me about Slashdot is, I'm very sure, the same thing that bugs everyone about it.
<P>
"That's not how I would have done it!"
<P>
Everybody thinks it, and they're all right, but they all want to do it a different way.  :\  I just think my way would be interesting.  Most of what would be different has to do with the comment system, the membership system, and the editorial practices...so, really, the main link would be that they'd both be news sites.
<P>
I am going somewhere with this -- I got back late from the fair, which is why I wasn't here to get the call back, which is why I'm not going to be online too late.  I want to get up a little earlier than usual so that when I call this guy at the time I would normally get up, I do not sound like I've just been beaten soundly and haven't slept for a few days.  (Which is how I normally sound first thing in the morning.)
<P>
Wish me lots and lots of luck.</p>
