<p>Boy, am I in it, too.
<P>
Okay, admissions first:  I didn't have use strict; at the beginning of my program.
<P>
-shields self from barrage of rotten fruit-
<P>
Anyway, I turned it on, and ran it, and got a whole page of errors before the program turned itself off:
<P>
newcards.p has too many errors.
<P>
and immediately knew that I was in pretty deep.
<P>
First, fix all those damned 'requires explicit package name' errors...
<P>
Okay, back.
<P>
Note to self:  Trust your elder Perlers.
<P>
Okay, this amazes the hell out of me.  It's...working, I guess, is the word.
<P>
I just described this process to a (non-programmer) friend of mine thusly:  "Imagine you're building a go-cart from random parts in a garage."  Essentially, this is what I've gotten to the point of.  It's a starting place.
<P>
Well, the go-cart's all put together, and you can get on it and all, but something's wrong with the drive mechanism, because it immediately accelerates to 50 MPH when you turn it on.  It's working, and I did something, but it's got a little way to go.
<P>
Now, it's *building* the file...but the output is supposed to be a nice orderly set of lines:<BR>
name:stock:shown<BR>
name1:stock1:shown1<BR>
name2:stock2:shown2<BR>
<P>
and instead, it's doing this
<P>
name:stock:shown<BR>
name:stock:shown<BR>
name:stock:shown<BR>
name:stock:shown<BR>
name:stock:shown<BR>
name:stock:shown<BR>
name1:stock1:shown1<BR>
name1:stock1:shown1<BR>
name1:stock1:shown1<BR>
name1:stock1:shown1<BR>
name1:stock1:shown1<BR>
name1:stock1:shown1<BR>
<P>
etc., ad nauseum.
<P>
Well, I'll work on it.  That's really the only option anyway.
<P></p>
