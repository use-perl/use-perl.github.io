<p>That is, it appears I'll be taking on a position at the tech support place I used to work.  (I'd like to avoid speaking about it as much as I can, mostly due to the <A HREF="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/15133">Dooce effect</A>.)
<P>
Needless to say, this isn't what I'm hoping for.  I'm hoping that I'll be able to get an internship through my school's program, or find contract work.  Or, at this point, be struck by lightning.
<P>
I <EM>so</EM> do not want to do that job again.  It paid decently, but it's not what I <EM>want</EM> to do.
<P>
<EM>&lt;pause&gt;</EM>
<P>
I'm talking about it.  Bad idea.  Time to be quiet now.
<P>
My frustration with schoolwork (doing one take-home after I cook dinner, probably in an hour or so) is trumped by my frustration with _Learning XML_.  It's all just sliding right off my brain; nothing's soaking in.  I can still drag the Camel with me to bed for light reading, but not the new book.  I was scared for a few hours that my brain was full, and I'd just hit my limit, would never learn anything else ever.
<P>
Upon reflection, though, that seems unlikely.  I'm sure it's just a temporary thing.  On to alfredo and exams...</p>

... is best accomplished with a project.  You want to learn XML?  Deal with some.  Produce or consume RSS files or (gag) DocBook.  Doing is key to learning.<p>
