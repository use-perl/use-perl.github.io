<p>Something's very wrong with me.
<P>
I'm not precisely sure how this happened, but I <EM>am no longer willing to socialize</EM>, and I'm not quite sure why.
<P>
I happened to be idling in an IRC channel and merlyn noted an instance of recent good luck, and <EM>I thought</EM> about congratulating him, but...but somehow it seemed redundant, unnecessary, and pointless.  Redundant because plenty had already said it was good luck, unnecessary because he doesn't need me to tell him that it's good news, and pointless because I know so little about the situation that I can't do it justice.
<P>
(BTW, if you do see this, Randal -- it's about time something went really right for you.  Now, it's time to wait for the anvil to fall on your enemy.  Karma's a bitch.)
<P>
Anyway...that's not the point.  I don't want to go out -- and I <EM>understand</EM> that, it's rare that I ever want to leave the house and somehow that just makes a lot of sense to me -- but it's somehow unnatural as well.  Who on earth am I competing with?  What's going to happen if I don't code all weekend, or try to code all night, or tell myself that -- since I got the day off work -- I'd better try to code with it?
<P>
I mean, not wanting to go out -- I don't have a <EM>laptop</EM>, so I understand that.  But at home, with Dew right beside me, with a keyboard under my fingers, I am <EM>no longer willing to try to communicate on IRC</EM>.  That's just wrong, somehow.
<P>
Anyway, I gotta get back to the frequency analyzer and the CGI::Application/HTML::Template kludge I'm putting together...&lt;/irony&gt;</p>

<h2>Socializing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pemungkah/">pemungkah</a> on 2003-07-22T21:51:23</h3>
Sounds like a local mood fluctuation - if it hasn't been going on for a while. If it has, call someone up and go to a good (or bad) movie, or a handball game, or anything you like to do, and then go out for a meal and talk about it afterwards.<br> <p> <br>Some real-life socialization is strongly encouraged!</p>
