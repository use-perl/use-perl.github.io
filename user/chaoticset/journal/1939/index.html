<p>I feel fairly awful at this point, and I'd like to know why.  All slothy and sinus-pressure-y and such.
<P>
I'll probably just drag my copy of _Nutshell_ with me to the laundromat and look at all the pretty things that can be done in Tk.  (Ideally, I want to make a GUI for the maintenance utilities.  Mainly because I suspect the client isn't going to sit well with a lot of "Oh, you have to type this in", but also because I could use graphical design exercise.  I have a tendency to make nonintuitive interfaces.)
<P>
What else...
<P>
My brother threw me some cash for a job I did a ways back for him, and along with some leftover Cashmas dough, I've got enough money to handle this month's installment of Appease Thy Landlord money.  Good thing, too.
<P>
I just wish I could wake up.  I feel so tired, and it's not because I forgot to have some caffeine (which has happened before).
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Slow Addendum:  My brain just isn't getting there.  Huge portions of my thought process seem to be returning none-found style errors.  English isn't much better.  Took some DayQuil; hoping things clear up by later today.  Wanted to get some work done.  Should check for fever.
