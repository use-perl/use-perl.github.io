<p>I'm doing something unbelievably stupid, or else my system's just given up altogether on sanity.
<p>
My print statements aren't working.  I'm really failing to understand how that's even possible.  I do understand that there are occasionally caching issues, etc. but at this point the only thing I can do is shake my finger at the computer and accuse it of being "made of crazy".

I think I need a shower and more coffee.</p>

Perhaps you have an errant <tt>select()</tt> lurking in the code.

I'm pretty sure now that it's related to my IDE.  PFE warns in the docs about this -- it won't necessarily print certain things at certain times, and Perl doesn't always print certain things at certain times, and between the two I think it wasn't printing squat.  Running it straight from the prompt displayed exactly what I expected.
<p>
There had been some weirdness like this before, but it was always rare -- most of the time, Perl prints like you'd expect, and most of the time PFE prints like you'd expect, and about 10% of the time they each do something wonky to make other things work internally.  That 10% of the time, if only PFE or Perl is modifying things, it still works fine.  It's only when PFE is in weird-land and Perl is also in weird-land that these things crop up.  I should have known better, though.
