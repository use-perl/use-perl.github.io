<p>Okay -- bounded-sum GROKKED.  El Groko.  I Understand.  It's worth my Life and my Soul, blah blah blah, I get it.
<P>
So, the major conceptual hurdle is down.
<P>
Next, I need to calculate the intersection of two lines.  Easy enough, but I can't remember how to do it except for trial-and-error, and don't want to code such a monstrosity.  I figure that there's an easy algebraic solution I probably never learned, or else someone else has coded such a monstrosity, and one way or another I'm right:  CPAN has <A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/author/MILSO/SchemaView-Plus-0.16/lib/Math/Project.pm">Math::Project</A>, which is exactly what I need.  It's part of a larger package, but that's not a big deal -- and if it becomes one in the future, I'll figure some way around it.  (Thanks, Milan!)
<P>
After that, I'll need to calculate the area of four different triangles, two with complete information and two others with angles and one side.  CPAN has <A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/author/JHI/perl-5.8.0/lib/Math/Trig.pm">trigonometry</A> so that's not a problem.  (Thanks, Jarkko and Raphael!)
<P>
Finally, I just need to write the bounded sum operation.  It should be straightforward and monotonous, so I should probably work out all the math ahead of time, write it in comments, and then work the Perl from the comments.  This method's worked in the past when I have my data structures well in hand and I get the math right; if I get the math wrong, it produces shitty code, and if I get the structures wrong, I end up breaking stuff that already works half the time.
<P>
Final sentence all this has been working up to:  It's clearly time to carry a pad of paper and a pen with me for a few days, work this crap all out, and see if it works in a few pertinent test cases.  (Instead of writing it tonight (wrong), rewriting it for a few hours tomorrow morning, and then trying to figure out what the hell I was doing the day after that.)</p>
