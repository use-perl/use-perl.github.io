<p>In case you're unaware of it, Stephen J. Cannell is at least partly responsible for a lot of TV shows, including (just a sample) Riptide, Silk Stalkings, The A-Team, Wiseguy, Rockford Files, Columbo, Baretta, etc.
<P>
A faint memory from my writing years came back to me during my daily drive a few days ago:  "It was a finished, three-act bag of shit."
<P>
This was in reference to an episode he'd started writing, and halfway through he realized his initial premise was flawed, in the sense that was going to produce a bad show.  He was perhaps an act and a half through it, and decided he was going to finish it, dammit.  At the end, it was "a bag of shit -- but it was a <EM>finished, three-act</EM> bag of shit."
<P>
He said from that point on he started taking more care in selecting ideas to start on, essentially pushing more design instead of immediate work.
<P>
So.  This is an awful module so far.  It may not be when I'm done with it -- I feel that the idea isn't terrible, just perhaps limited in application -- but it will be <B>finished</B>, even if I never write anything else but this one module.
<P>
I am touching nothing else until this is done, except to journal code work in progress and detail any related thoughts here.  This is an experiment.  I want to see if I can finish something.  I want to see if my code can be like my food -- if I can reach a certain point, note that it's the best I can manage, and hand the damn thing to someone else to eat.
<P>
I have to go code now.</p>

<p>I was reading Cannell's <a href="http://www.writerswrite.com/screenwriting/lecture4.htm" title="writerswrite.com">screenwriting lecture</a writerswrite.com> recently.  While he's not my favorite writer, I have to give the man props for the number of successful series he's done.  However, he's no <a href="http://worldsofjms.com/" title="worldsofjms.com">J. Michael Straczynski</a worldsofjms.com>.</p>
