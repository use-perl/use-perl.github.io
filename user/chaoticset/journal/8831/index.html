<p>I've lost the battle, and perhaps the war too.  I simply cannot keep up with the site any more, and while that's been ongoing, I freely admit it now.  I don't have the time, and even if I did, I'm not scanning everybody, there's simply too much journal activity.
<P>
That having been said, I noted something recently.  A while back I wrote some specific functions that essentially were wrappers for open() with various modes.  My sanity check kicked in after I wrote a couple, and I realized that I didn't really need to do it -- open was really as clean as it got without sacrificing functionality.  Having an append() and readfile() and closefile() etc. just cluttered up namespace.
<P>
This was some time back.  Recently, I've had to parse an entire directory, for which I discovered opendir.  It has occurred to me that opendir does not have the niceties that open has -- filehandles don't work with while without a little extra arcana, stripping out the . and .. files and skipping unreadables without dying and a few other things.  These little typing exercises from the Ram weren't upsetting until I started the second thing that included them, and the magic word "refactoring" floated to the top of my mind.
<P>
"Gee.  Couldn't I build a little wrapper to these, something that returns a list of files in the directory minus the . and .. at the very least?  Wouldn't that help with readability, since you're adding all this quickly-typed but line-noise-reminiscent code to handle some special situations and whatnot?  I mean, since you're adding stuff to warn on unreadables and all that, you might as well go whole hog, make functions that return 1 for a completely well-read directory and return a list of files that didn't work for an error..."
<P>
The voice is still going.  I think it's a good idea, and I'm going to attempt a refactor tomorrow to help me write the guts of my GUI (since the GUI is going to require essentially the same directory-opening activity as the command-line filter system.)</p>

You can use<blockquote><div> <tt>@files = glob('*');</tt> </div></blockquote>which returns a list of all files for the current directory, and doesn't include "." and "..".
<p>You can use a full, absolute or relative path in front of the "*", to get a listing for other directories; but be aware that, by contrast to opendir()/readdir(), the results do include the said path. For opening the files that's a good thing, but if you want a listing of just the bare filenames, you'll have to strip it.</p>
