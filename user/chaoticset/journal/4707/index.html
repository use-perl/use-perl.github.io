<p>The good news is that my project scored a nice big 100%.  She graded only on technical aspects and not presentation, or I'm sure I could have ended up with a bit of downgrading for sloppy presentation.
<P>
The bad news is that I'm missing 1/3rd of the assignments for the semester.  Two of those I merely forgot to do because I missed class and never checked for assignments; two of those, however, I ended up putting off because they frustrated me.  Browsers have a frustrating habit of not giving you decent feedback to debug with, IMHO.  "But WHY don't the tags work!?" I wanted to scream several times.
<P>
That's okay.  I have a whole pot of coffee in the other room, big chunks of time, and some of the assignments are half-started.  Tonight, assignments, tomorrow, two take-home exams.
<P>
I will feel <EM>so</EM> much better Thursday.</p>

this is in fact one goof thing about Netscape 4 and piror. The source viewer almost always<br>displays the region in question (blinking I believe).

It's just occasional frustration.  Normally I can spot my errors with a thorough going-over of the code in question, but if my nerves are sufficiently frazzled, I find myself attributing Machiavellian schemes to the computer.  "It WANTS me to be mad...<em>so I'll slip up, and then it will have the upper hand</em>!"
<p>
It's usually nothing that a decent meal and a good night's sleep won't cure.</p>
