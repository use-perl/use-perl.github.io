<p>The cool-looking thermos I got as part of last year's loot has a strange tendency to cause coffee to go bad in it.  Literally bad, like bacteria are present or something.  I don't get it in the steel cup that came with it, but it's lined, so either the thermos has something in it, or the metal makes it do that.
<P>
Trillian's got a patch for the AIM problem, so a quick installation later and I can chat with my father again instead of paying for a phone call from Maine to Kentucky.  Ah, the wonders of this modern age.  (Yeah, I know, if I was really modern I'd have some sort of telephony setup.  He's illiterate and I type fast.  Let me bask in the glory of technology, willya?)
<P>
Two classes today, and I'm doing what I shouldn't be:  Homework just before the class.  :(  Well, I forgot there was homework.  At least it'll be done.  I have three hours between classes today.
<P>
My eye is doing significantly better; that is, I can see while driving through both eyes without constant rubbing.  Headaches are gone, too.</p>
