<p>Back up all the working things so I don't accidentally gut the code, start examining the JS insertion process...
<P>
belg4mit posted a regex that would swap submit HTML into a button with a JS function call.  I'm not dealing directly with HTML except in the template for HTML::Template, though.  (Nothing against belg4mit, because I was very vague about this all in the last post.)
<P>
No more vagaries; I'm going to lay it out here.
<P>
The script uses the state mechanism from the Cookbook (a hash associating names of states to subrefs for those states).  State is determined by another sub, which checks for a valid password, valid session, and what state was desired; if the state desired requires a valid user, and there's no valid user, it defaults.
<P>
The code is all handled with short subs that I call CGI from; that code is called from the state sub and sometimes from the specific state subs themselves.
<P>
I've tried to get to the point that I don't have to call CGI directly any more, and I've pretty much succeeded.  (I was using CGI for quick debugging, printing a header and some variable's contents, but I've actually written in specific debug routines and a section of the HTML::Template calls specifically produce debug info at the end of the generated page.)
<P>
I'll look at it again after a cup of strong tea.  I was hoping to create a single simple JS call (the ONSUBMIT="") so I wouldn't have to go digging around in this crap again, but it looks like that may be too limited.  belg's solution may be the right one:  JS calls for individual submit functions.
<P>
Then again, perhaps I just haven't had enough caffeine.  I'll look at all this again with a strong cup of tea by my side, and report if something significant crops up (like actual coding).</p>
