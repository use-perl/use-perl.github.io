<p>I still feel the Engrishifier is lacking key change-methods.  Consideration is currently being given to writing a quick analysis tool, where I input the exact words I <EM>think</EM> would have resulted in the proper meaning, and the tool gives an analysis of common translation errors based on that.
<P>
Of course, simple letter-word style analysis won't give me those wonderful shifts of concept that I've seen occasionally, nor will it give the utterly random names for things which occur sometimes (such as the band name King Chicken Fucker).  For those, I think a list of random words as the __DATA__, plus something that will construct, fiddle around with, and insert said random words with some appropriate punctuation might produce interesting results.  Eventually, I'll want multiple modes, where you can get a band name, a regular sentence, a random sentence, an advertising slogan, etc.
<P>
I'm spending way too much mental energy on this.  :\  At least it's good regex practice.
<P>
I probably won't get any time to work on it today until much later, though.  My brother's dragging me out for some social interaction, most likely as a reward for helping him get his warranty problem solved.  In the end, he got a fairly good deal; US$50 off a US$80 three-year warranty, plus a new monitor, means he's completely covered for about a year longer than he expected.
<P>
I was happy to start looking through some C books I have and realize I didn't completely forget <EM>everything</EM> I learned about the language -- I just never learned much to begin with.  Time to get a copy of the GNU compiler and start playing with it again.  :)  </p>
