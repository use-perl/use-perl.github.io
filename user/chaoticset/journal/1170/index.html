<p>Well, I've finally gone and done it.  I'm so damn sick of the code I built for the cart program that I'm probably going to just tear it up and start fresh.
<P>
At least I understand what I'm doing now.  (Sort of.)
<P>
The original plan was sloppy; you'd go to the singles page, you'd click on a bunch of stuff, and then you'd hit the cart button.  If you went back to the main page, you'd lose your cart.  If anything went wrong, you couldn't recover it.  (Because it was a file, the tags didn't follow you into the main page because it wasn't generated on the fly, blah blah blah.)
<P>
Anyway, the new system (I hope) will be much more robust.  The cart will follow you around the shop, just like a good physical cart should be able to.  The cart button will be everywhere and should work no matter what.
<P>
Above all, if I can do it, I'm going to get rid of the 'cart file' thing.  I'm pretty sure I can, but I have to make sure before I judiciously delete all this code; hence, the 'research'.
<P>
I have exams this week.  Basic networking class, discrete math structures class, statistics class, and there's a research paper due in my English class.  All this week (well, I *think* it's all this week.)  Hence the 'homework'.
<P>
And I've got quite a bit of Fatboy Slim and Moby on my winamp currently - that's the dash of techno.  (Good conscience prevents the pun I was going to add about a dash of techno and the word 'flava'.)
<P>
That's all for now.</p>
