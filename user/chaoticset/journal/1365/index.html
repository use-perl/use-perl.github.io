<p>Shockingly.  I suspect he didn't want to talk to me because the business end of things went south a ways; however, I understand that this is not a get-rich-quick scheme.  It's a "gee, I'd like to have an example of my work somewhere" scheme, along with the faint possibility of regular work next year, so I'm fine with it.
<P>
Hell, I might become a partner if the business guy doesn't come back.  I know a little about business.  (Damn little, but life is short.)
<P>
The good news:  He still wants it, he's still enthusiastic, and he seems set on me for it.
<P>
The bad news:  Loans probably won't be happening this year.  (This literal year.  He's going to start checking into more of this after the Christmas season's over.)
<P>
All that means is that I have more time to fix this friggin' code.  He wants to have a server for testing by (mid|late)-January, and I'm all for that.  I could finally point my father at the thing and say, "Here, look.  I did this."
<P>
(I know, it's not something I should be proud of yet, considering the code's state.  He's easily impressed, though.  ;)  )
<P>
I came back to the code this morning to find that my work with the cartview isn't done; it's not updating the cart hash properly.  (In fact, it's doing something downright weird; it appears to be adding strings in some bizarre fashion.  I suspect highly that the incoming data may be the problem, so I have to go check all my split() uses and see what I buggered up.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Is 'buggered up' appropriate use?  I'm new to the word 'buggered'.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, I found the problem.  In a sleep-deprived haze last night, I had written the assign-array-to-hash-value stuff last night, and wrote all the variable assignments in list form:
<P>
($thing, $otherthing, $YAthing) = ($hash{$key});
<P>
and some of them were still like that.
<P>
The result, of course, was that $thing ended up with the whole friggin' line.  Silly me; I should have seen this instantly, because I had A: Changed the variable assignment in other places and B: I complained so bitterly to myself after attempting the assign-array-to-hash-value thing earlier.
<P>
Glad I've documented it; now I won't do it ever again.  (::insert bitter laughter::)
<P>
Okay.  Coffee.  Code.  Go go go!</p>

<br>
<br>Ha, ha - must be all us Brit's hanging out on use.perl rubbing off on you eh?
<br>
<br>- Yes, FWIW that's appropriate usage (grin).
