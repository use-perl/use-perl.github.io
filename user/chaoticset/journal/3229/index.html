<p>Just as an exercise, I wanted to see how long it would take me to build a script that would take an M3U playlist as an argument and produce a utilitarian unordered list-page out of it.  Did that yesterday; took maybe twenty minutes.
<P>
Not that I'm vain enough to think anybody cares what's on my playlist; like I said, this was an exercise.  I just wanted to see how difficult parsing M3U files was while seeing how difficult it was for me to write a quick script.
<P>
Favorable results, I think.
<P>
I had never heard of the Oblique deck Torgo mentioned before, so I investigated.  Somehow I found it reminiscent of my experiences with the Creative Whack Pack my sister in Maryland had, but I'm certain that the Oblique deck predates it significantly.  It also reminds me of _The Observation Deck_, Naomi Epel's random-notion-generator deck for authors.
<P>
I've got two tests to do, one for next Tuesday and one for next Wednesday, so I really should probably go do them today.  I most likely won't, though; the last three days have felt interminably busy.  Maybe I'll get a little work done with Yazouza, though.  I want to add some things I couldn't before, and I think it's good regular expression practice.
<P>
I impressed someone who seems quite experienced with web design (in the sense that person's gotten actual money for it) with the Engrish bot.  I knew Yazzy was a good idea.  To hell with having kids!  I'm building BOTS!  They seem a lot more likely to do what they're told.  ;)</p>
