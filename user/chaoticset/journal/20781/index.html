If you haven't, go see a doctor. <i>Now</i>. An EKG is quick and easy, if a bit chilly (I swear, they refridgerate the contact gel), and isn't a big deal. If you've got a heart problem it'll show up, and the sooner it's dealt with the better. (Before you die is usually the best time) If it's not a heart problem that'll show quickly too, in which case tagamet might be the right answer. Or, on the other hand, it might not be. Either way your doctor will have a better idea of it than you do.

Maybe you're right.
<p>
In the past, I've had chest pains from gas before that were more severe, but there are a few mitigating circumstances here -- I've gained about fifty pounds since January.

I just can't help but feel like I'm overreacting, 'sall...</p>

A friend's an emergency room nurse. Believe me when I say that calling your doctor up, telling them you've got some chest pains, and would like to get checked out is <i>not</i> over-reacting. (I've seen people scolded for not coming in at 2 AM on christmas when they've had chest pains) Nor will most insurance companies complain about it -- if 99 out of 100 EKGs show nothing, that 100th one that catches a problem before you have a heart attack <i>more</i> than makes up for it. And your doctor would much rather see you asking about chest pain than signing a death certificate or finding themselves up to their elbows in your chest.<br> <br>EKGs are quick and easy. (And relatively cheap even if you've no insurance) Call, go in, get checked out. It'll take 10 minutes or so, plus whatever wait time at the doctor's office or walk-in clinic. Do it. And if it shows nothing, then you've both got an idea of what heart trouble <i>doesn't</i> feel like as well as a baseline EKG just in case something does happen later.

<p>Then Dan is definitely right -- you should see a doctor about things.</p>

<p>Have you been following any of the stories about Bill Clinton's heart surgery? Apparently he had been having chest pains for six months or more -- particularly after jogging -- but had been assuming it was due to over-exertion. When the pains got worse recently and he hadn't been exercising as much, he went to see a doctor, and had a bypass a few days later. Apparently he had been on the brink of a massive heart attack.

</p><p>Heart problems are often self-misdiagnosed as heartburn or a stomachache, but it's too serious a matter to let that happen. Get it checked out so that you know for sure.</p>

<p>Please go check.  We don't want to be mourning the loss of someone on this website.</p>

<p>And may I suggest <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdiet.html" title="fourmilab.ch">this</a fourmilab.ch> if you don't want to keep the 50 pounds?</p>

<h2>Only GERD</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2004-09-09T14:13:55</h3>
*ahem* it can cause esophageal cancer when left over time. At least as of a few years ago when it claimed my father's life after a year of slow, agonizing death, there's an almost 100% morbidity rate from this kind of cancer. Who knew all those years of heartburn and burping would kill him in the end.

Thank you for the concern, and I'm sorry about your father.
<p>
When I said 'only GERD', I meant 'the less urgent GERD as opposed to the possibly-immediately-fatal heart attack'.  The last time I went to my doctor with abdominal pain he spoke with me at length about this because he figures (rightly, I think) that someone as young as I with signs like these has enormous dietary issues to overcome.
</p><p>
At the time he decided it sounded consistent with early diverticulitis, and checked for that (which turned out not to be the case, luckily), but his warning about GERD stuck with me.  I don't underestimate it, I just have organizational issues that have prevented me in the past from seeing a physician regularly.</p>
