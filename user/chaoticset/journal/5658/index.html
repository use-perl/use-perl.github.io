<p>I have just decided which system I will attempt to learn a little bit of in order to speed (and, hopefully polish) my final project with.

The <EM>way</EM> I chose it is the shameful bit, and I just realized it.

"Let's see...PPM, install HTML::Mason, install HTML::Template...
<P>
"Now...perl.  use HTML::Mason;  __END__.  Errors.  Bugger that.
<P>
"perl.  use HTML::Template;  __END__.  No errors.  Well, that's good then."
<P>
I know.  I'm sure Mason has a lot going for it, but "workingness" is kind of important at this very moment in time.  I promise I'll come back and massage Mason a little to get it working someday, Perl Scouts Honor.

<h2>Differences</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lachoy/">lachoy</a> on 2002-06-14T16:45:59</h3>
<p>HTML::Mason and HTML::Template are two different beasts. IIRC, HTML::Template is a straightforward, simple templating module that can be used outside of a web request; HTML::Mason is geared to work inside a webserver (CGI, mod_perl, etc.) and gives you much more functionality but also has a greater learning curve.</p>

<p>But if you're looking for templating modules, you'd do yourself a favor to check out the Template Toolkit. (<a href="http://openinteract.sourceforge.net/" title="sourceforge.net">PPM available</a sourceforge.net>) Just my 2c<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

I'll take a look, but a little investigation has made me think that HTML::Template is right up my alley for this project.
<p>
I'll go back and learn about Mason anyway, just because it's Some Other Way, but it'll have to be after the project.</p>

<h2>Perl Scouts!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2002-06-14T19:46:25</h3>
<p>Think of the badges people could earn! I love the idea!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Sort of like Eagle Scout? Hmmm...Order of the Llama (Order of the Arrow). Do it show that I had a brother , grandfather, and an uncle that were big into scouts?<br> <br>Odd parallel track for the Mongers to set up, no?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I don't know enough about scout-style organizations to suggest badges, really.
<p>
A real problem would be convincing people that it doesn't diminish them, as Scouts is viewed (by some) to be a "kiddie thing".
</p><p>
There's also the possibility that you're joking, but it doesn't sound like the kind of joke you make.</p>
