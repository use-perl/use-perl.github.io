<p>Got to my internship late.
<P>
Got there without the code I'd been working on.
<P>
Found out that the dataset is completely differently set up than I thought, meaning that it'll be a lot easier to work with but that almost all my previous code is now useless.
<P>
Started using one of the iBooks to build the code that I would need, found out that setting the delete key to send a backspace to the terminal doesn't work, so I can't work in vi.
<P>
Tried to use TextEdit, realized that the friendly iBook interface doesn't like letting me into the folder I set myself up with for test scripts, gave up and decided to attempt to run scripts from another area altogether.
<P>
And, as final salt upon my injury...I came here to chronicle these events, and the new layout looks like ass on IE...at least, on this version of IE.
<P>
Don't get me wrong here.  I feel a sick attachment already growing to this system, just because it's so friggin' easy on the eyes and fingers.  It's just that, if I want to get anything done, I'm going to have to learn a boatload of new practices.
<P>
Ah, hell.  That's the way it is with anything.  Better to have learned and lost than never to have learned at all.</p>

<p>I've never depended on delete, the arrow keys (well, only at first), page up/down, etc. for vi.  Maybe partially because I've been a mac user from way back, but actually more because the dumb terminals at school in 1996, despite all apparently being the same model, all gave varying degrees of success with those keys.  I still find vi quite handy.</p>

<p>One of my first questions when I tried out emacs was, "What do I press to delete?"  "The delete key."  "No, I mean what do I <i>really</i> press to delete?"...</p>
