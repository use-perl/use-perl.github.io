<p>I feel tired, but I shouldn't.  I got plenty of sleep last night, and woke like a child on (insert holiday here) day to run and play with my newly-returned toy.
<P>
Right now, my primary concern is twofold:  Prep for finals, and Get Perl And Apache Going Again.
<P>
I plan on having that done in a scant few minutes; I just have to copy the burned copies over, and after I retype the code, I should be right where I was before.
<P>
Oh, and I have the further assistance of a Terry's Chocolate Raspberry.  I really love those things.  :)
<P>
I got a working filter put together on the 486 just before Alex came back, btw.  It just stripped comments and empty lines from whatever you fed into it, and I fiddled with it to leave the #!/usr/bin/perl line so I could see if there was a -w or anything else on it.  I was happy with it.
<P>
I also reinstalled _Alice_, to see what it sounds like.  I had played the whole thing without sound and I was a little disappointed in places -- the sounds I had imagined going with it were much better.  *shrug*  Mostly good, though.</p>
