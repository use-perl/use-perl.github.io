<p>In what might be described as "not a terrible idea at all", I kind of had this crazy idea for building a to-do list handler that (get ready for overkill) would examine the list for dependencies, then generate a PNG diagram of what had to be done first, what had to be done next, etc.
<P>
I got this idea after jumping into makefiles while installing modules in Linux recently.  (Of course, my mind is racing ahead of itself:  "Maybe this could be used to generate timetables too...and if it stores it in XML, then you could convert other documents in XML into this thing's XML and generate PNGs of things like makefiles and stuff...")
<P>
This is highly ambitious talk for my mind, considering that I'm really, really low on the coding pole right now.  I'm scribbling notes for it anyways, just because, well, hell, I'd really like to have something like that.
<P>
In other news, my homework for class wasn't all that badly botched.  The instructor seemed impressed with my little solution to "get all the items from a .pod document and print them out", except that it wasn't quite what the assignment spec asked for.  Got 'em all fixed up in about an hour's worth of coding.
<P>
I kept meaning to point this out here, but I keep forgetting to:  Years ago, when I first started using DOS, I was irritated by cls.  "WTF does cls stand for?"  I'm sure there was a reason to call it cls, and it isn't like it totally hamstrung me or something; but when I first typed 'clear' in Linux to clear the screen, I felt a click.  A little click in the "that makes so much freakin' sense" department, so to speak.

About the title:  In Maine, those three words, spoken aloud, rhyme.  "Idears, Arrears, and clear."

IIRC: <tt>cls == clear screen</tt>

Just reading the brief gets me thinking that a significant amount of overlap exists.
<p>
I'll have to go over the discombobulated thoughts carefully when I've got a few spare moments and see if there's anything I can contribute.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Feel free to join =) Don't think it'll be an intensive project. More spaced over a period.

<h2>cls and clear</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-06-13T23:14:05</h3>
<p>Me too.  After learning "clear" I was deeply annoyed to find system-wide "cls" aliases set up at school and on the first main server I worked on at work.</p>
