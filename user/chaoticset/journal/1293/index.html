<p>Here I am again.
<P>
Okay.  The script is now doing the following things:
<P>
<LI>Reading in the inventory
<LI>Printing the search results from the inventory
<LI>Writing to the cart file
<LI>Setting up a session ID
<P>
How many of them is it doing RIGHT?
<P>
<LI>Printing the search results from the inventory
<P>
I'm *pretty* sure I've got it reading the inventory right except that it has an aneurysm on some of the cards.  Check the box and add one of this card, but check this other one, and the script just farts my error message 'We don't have any <card name> on our shelf'.  Which tells me that they're not matching up for some reason.  Gotta check that the stock file's writing properly for that card, gotta check that the hash is building right, gotta check my regex, blah, blah, blah.  You get the idea.
<P>
The cart file...is sort of working.  The problem is the one I just described, so it's not writing the right *things* to the cart file, just writing some.  I guess I shouldn't complain.
<P>
The session ID it's generating right now is totally bogus.  It's fudge.  The sub for making session IDs utterly stymied me for a few minutes, so in an effort to keep going on the rest of the script while I had momentum, I just made it return something that sort of looks like my concept of 'session ID'.  (My *wrong* concept, btw.)
<P>
Oh, and the secret project...
<P>
A discussion with tilly of perlmonks revealed my problem:  I need Cygwin.  Guess what I'm doing for the next hour?  Right.  Finding, downloading, installing.  I miss the days when installing was tedious and finding was easy, back when I was looking for very popular and very widespread software.  :\  Regardless, by the end of the day I should be lookin' at working PerlMUD text.
<P>
I don't have zMUD installed on this box...dammit, dammit, dammit.  I have to find a client now, too...  :\
<P>
The one huge bright ball of joy about the secret project is that fiddling with it will be easy; PFE has customizable templates, so after I figure out what things I'll be typing the most, I won't be typing them anymore.  :)
<P>
(I'm not sure if 'ball of joy' is equivalent to 'happy fun ball'.  I'm going to guess no, because of the mismatched adjective count.)</p>
