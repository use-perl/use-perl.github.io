<p>I guess every entry in this thing could be titled 'Bizarreness'.
<P>
I got my doctor's appointment over with today and the conclusion:  No conclusion.  She doesn't know what it is.  She's actually very pleasant, but recommended a chest film if I want to nail down my persistent cough.  I'll think it over.
<P>
She also said the headaches didn't seem stress-related.  Oh well -- I'm not worried about them.  The memory loss is my worry.
<P>
I did actually figure something out about Perl, though.  I printed a copy of the code and the error log and took them with me.  There's really only three errors, despite the three pages:  A useless use of hash element at 65, a useless use of single ref constructor in void context at 65, and then a bunch of uninitialized value in string eq errors, all at line 106.
<P>
This is leagues better than the errors I *apparently* was getting before.  The logs before had about twenty different "cannot find file..." each and then crashed the script.  WTF?
<P>
Even weirder - it just seemed to *vanish*.  WTFF?*
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Maybe this is my fault.  Perl wasn't meant for the buggy and buggered Win32 system; perhaps it's the OS having its head up its ass.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
I figure the last error is due to the other two, and the other two are because of how I'm trying to build a hash.  *sigh*  I thought I had it figured out.
<P>
Regardless...I have coffee and that's really all you need.  Time to code.  If I can get the hash working right, then this thing should work.  Then I can concentrate on that stupid cart file problem.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
*What the fucking fuck
