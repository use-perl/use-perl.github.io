<p>I am SO happy.
<P>
The stocker script appears to be doing *everything* it needs to do.  :)
<P>
I finally have all the data worked out.  Format this, format that.  It reads bare Cl**ster and the new inventory file's format, and spits out what it's supposed to.  A little minor tinker and it'll be alpha-runnin'.  :)
<P>
Wow, wow, wow.
<P>
Had an argument with my mother tonight about my brother, the insanely well paid one who has no real ability other than brownnosing.  I explained very patiently that I want to have a legacy; I want someone to be able to point at what I've done in my life and say, "See this?  He did that."  Because my brother is going to die someday - but I will not.  A little piece of me will live on in the things I have coded and the things I have written.  There will be nothing of him; he doesn't understand himself, much less the world that operates him.
<P>
Yeah, I know.  I'm not there yet.  I remind myself of that every day - that this is the beginning, that the end is far off, and that the progresses I find amazing now will be insignificant compared to what I will do someday.  I'm not there yet.
<P>
But I will be.
<P>
Oh, and there's actually a reason for this entry, too.  :\  Sorry to wax philosophical.  It's to remind myself.
<P>
Where was I?
<P>
CGI.  Oh, right, that.  Well, now that I've got operational stock files and I can create them whenever the hell I feel like it, the CGI is the next step.  I need to rework the code I have.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I should point this out while I'm thinking of it:  When I sat down and made myself rewrite the code, it came out much cleaner.  I don't know if this is good Perl - I doubt it - but it's fairly easy for me to understand when I read it.
<P>
(I couldn't get the code tags to work, so I just BRed the whole mess.  In case you try to read it, it's an excerpt; this part reads in lines of new inventory, ignored)
<P>
print DEBUG "Start of New Inventory builder.\n";<BR>
<BR>
my $i = 0;<BR>
while (<NEWINV>) {<BR>
 # First, let's get rid of the first line, the trash line...<BR>
 if ($i == 0) {<BR>
  $i++;<BR>
 } else {<BR>
  # This part should ONLY happen the second line and every line after.<BR>
  chomp;<BR>
  s/( ){8}//;<BR>
  s/( )/=/;<BR>
  ($stock, $name) = (split(/=/));<BR>
#  print DEBUG "$name, $stock\n";<BR>
  # The next line is a cheap trick where an elegant solution should go.<BR>
  # If the first character of the card name is a nonword character,<BR>
  # the next line replaces it with Ae.  This is to handle that weird<BR>
  # AE character.  I realize it's cheap.  It's also all I have right now.<BR>
  $name =~ s/^\W/Ae/;<BR>
  # The next regex changes any single comma with a single space into just<BR>
  # a space.  This is to match some errors in the Cl**ster list; I should<BR>
  # clean this up in the future.  (Make it so it matches properly but keeps<BR>
  # the proper name in the stock file.)<BR>
  $name =~ s/, / /;<BR>
  $new{$name} = $stock;<BR>
 }<BR>
}<BR>
<BR>
print DEBUG "End of New Inventory builder.\n";<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
I'm thinking of redoing the CGI this way.  It makes me think it may be MUCH cleaner if I do it.  :\  What daunts me (...they were dauntless.  "Who the hell needs daunts?" was a common thing to hear then...) is the length of that wretched script.  It looks like crap, it *is* crap, and I honestly don't want to have to go through crap again.
<P>
Pay now or pay later, I guess.
<P>
I'll at least make an attempt to clean up the existing; if it looks like changes would be as much work as rewriting it, I'll rewrite it.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm so happy to be programming tonight!  I didn't think I'd have the energy.  Well, two liters of Mountain Dew plus a few cups of strong-ass coffee will do that to you.  :)
