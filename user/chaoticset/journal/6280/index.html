<p>My last post was seven days ago.
<P>
Information at my new job is in no short supply so I've spent a lot of time going over documents from my training there -- and while I was doing that, two days ago, my instructor looked at me and said:
<P>
"You're going to take a live call in front of everybody at the recognition event Wednesday."
<P>
The end result of <EM>that</EM> being that I got nearly no sleep the past two days at all, along with being unable to eat hardly anything.  I crammed so much into my head I thought it was going to explode at some point.
<P>
This event would include people from the company we have a contract with, so if I botched this thing in some fashion, I could easily have lost my job.
<P>
My instructor told me five minutes before the event that it was a joke, and I was not going to be taking a live call, and that the whole class had been in on it since the day before.
<P>
Some day I'm going to forgive my instructor.  Not any day soon, but some day.
<P>
The upshot of all this is that I have gotten nothing done at all with the project (and when I explained to him the level of stress I was under, he apologized, to his credit).  On the up side, I think I've figured out how the subs should be logically separated in Newser, I only have to implement it tonight when I get home from training.
<P>
I'm about half way through all the journal entries I missed.  Expect a few odd comments on old entries, folks.  :)</p>

you made your first step into the jaded world of IT, I believe.  Make sure you read up on <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/30/index.html" title="theregister.co.uk">BOFH</a theregister.co.uk><nobr> <wbr></nobr>... lots of retaliatory measures mentioned.

I'll start reading up promptly.
<p>
However, the karmic debt has been settled.  Said prankster left his WinNT account unlocked earlier today, and one of the other instructors took advantage of that to send a "I left my machine unlocked!" message to a large section of the company.

I really need to get my sense of vengeance overdeveloped again if I'm going to compete in these activities, though.  I'm far too nice most of the time, it seems...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:\</p>
