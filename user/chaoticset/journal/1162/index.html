<p>I've posted again on Monks.  I'm getting a weird error, and when I searched it up, all that came up was one post, and made the error even weirder.  For whatever reason, <A HREF ="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=123094&lastnode_id=479">bad file descriptor</A> is an error that puzzled me.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Quick Addendum:  I found out what it was, and boy do I feel stupid now.  I closed STOCK one too many times.  I made an edit request (I didn't want to delete the node - since the problem seemed so odd at first, other people might have that problem too).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><br/><br/>I think I've started to track down the problem with my memory, although the headaches may just be bad genetics on my part.  Some research I read a while back seemed to indicate that Alzheimer's had a higher incidence rate in people who had little pockets of dead brain tissue, and that those pockets were caused by - surprise - sharp, short headaches.  My father's side of the family has Alzheimer's something fierce, so that may be the problem:  Minor, systemwide brain damage, a few thousand cells at a time.
<P>
On the up side, it's unlikely I'll develop actual Alzheimer's because I can write florid prose.  (Not a joke; apparently that's what the study indicated.  Linguistic fluidity was found in non-alzheimer's-affected subjects in the study.)  Lucky me, I always thought being a writer would get me fame and fortune.  At least it's good for me in the long run.
<P>
Oh, the memory problem.  Well, turns out that there's some evidence that you can still *store* long-term memories just peachy, but might have *access* problems if you're not getting REM sleep.  I guarantee, with all the caffeine I've been downing and the weird hours I keep now, that I don't get enough, maybe not any at all.
<P>
Perl.  Right.
<P>
Well, the work I did with the CGI is producing weird results.
<P>
Everything in the stock file now comes up right.  I need to build the update code; that is, I need to make it so that it
<P>
Reads the entire stock in;
<P>
Deals with the cart and updates the stock data;
<P>
Writes the new stock data.
<P>
Crap.  Where was I going with this?
<P>
Oh, right.  I don't need "update" code for the cart files, because the cart viewer will automatically fix it before it prints it to the HTML.  (It'll also fix it before it goes to invoice.  Good thing I decided to have a confirmation on the cart purchase, or I'd have to try to integrate all of this stuff into the one CGI.  That appears to be a lot harder than what I'm trying to do.)
<P>
In other news, I have a devious plan.  I found the Eliza code (it took me so long to find it that I'm embarrassed, it really never occurred to me that CPAN would carry it because it's so tiny and stupid and ancient) and I want to try to build a chatbot that acts like...me.
<P>
See?  Said it was devious.</p>
