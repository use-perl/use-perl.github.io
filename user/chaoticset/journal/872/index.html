<p>Well, a bunch of Dew, a lot of Chinese food, and several hours later, my test is done, and now I'm ready for the fun part.
<P>
I need to design this stupid data system.
<P>
I swear to Order I must be a damn nitwit.  For all the design stuff I keep reading, it just never lands in my mind until it's too late:  DESIGN FIRST, GOD DAMMIT.
<P>
And let that be a lesson to...me.
<P>
Well, the basics are fairly easy.  Build a function that drops the whole file into an array, then build one that drops the whole *new* file into another one.  (See, I'm going to dump the whole line, name:stock:shown, into one single array value.  That's so I don't have to figure out how to work multidimensionals properly.  Okay, so it's not the right kind of lazy.  I still think it'll speed things up significantly.)
<P>
Once there's two arrays, it's going to check the new stuff's first entry (because it assumes these are at least *roughly* alphabetic) and spin the other array until the two closest matches are at each end, the one before at the bottom and the one after at the top.
<P>
THEN it grabs the new one (because this is the spot it should go into the full inventory) and pushes it onto that array at the bottom.
<P>
Repeat, rinse, condition, you get the idea.
<P>
Well, I do, mostly.  And it'll result in those elements being sorted.  Assuming you've started with two sorted arrays, this should be quick.
<P>
I'm going to kick back with my whiteboard and work out the code details, and I'll come back once I've gotten to the compiling stage.  Should be tomorrow.
<P>
And perhaps, from now on, I'll remember what I'm supposed to do first.<BR>
CHEESE!<BR>
God Damn, no!  Not cheese!<BR>
DESIGN!<BR>
Yes, yes, design.<BR>
<P>
Sometimes I feel like a trained ape, honestly.</p>
