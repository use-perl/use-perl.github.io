<p>I never used to be able to relax.  I'd heard about it, don't get me wrong; it just sounded awful, like shooting yourself in the foot.
<P>
I've managed it a few times and, this being the second time I can firmly recall, I'm very impressed with it.  I'll have to try it more in the future, because I feel...somehow <EM>recharged</EM> and <EM>energized</EM>.  Prepared.  Ready to kick butt and take names, so to speak.
<P>
I managed to relax by explaining the problem to Laura's former workplace acquaintance and outlining various other things, such as the Google programming competition, XBox capabilities, and Perl.  He doesn't know Perl, but I showed him a handful of lines from the Llama.  He also invited me to come to a LAN party sometime; I told him I'd definately consider it.
<P>
Combine a little relaxation with JD's ever-helpful advice (I fired off an email before I left, hoping that something would come of it -- JD's time problems are numerous and sporadic, so email communication frequently isn't possible) and JD has responded in kind.  Ammunition is always appreciated.  :)
<P>
Hi ho, hi ho...it's off to build I go...</p>
