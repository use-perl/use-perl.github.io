<p>I'm calmly swigging Dew and chomping down on a homemade breakfast sandwich (That's two restaurant-size sausage patties, two fried eggs, and two slices of cheese on an everything bagel.  That's right, heartburn in the palm of your hand,) but it's deceptive.
<P>
I'm going to the possible new job today for the first time.  I'm supposed to arrive for a sort of walk-around orientationy thing, then there's a group interview at 2, then there's an individual hiring process at 3.  (Roughly.  I'm sure I've mangled some part of the process somehow.)
<P>
So I'm nervous, but I'm trying my best to be rational about it.  There's nothing that letting my nervousness run me is going to get me, nothing like calm or insight or anything else.  Keeping my head cool, getting a leisurely shave and finishing my proteinous breakfast are the entire agenda.
<P>
I didn't know where the place was until 40 minutes ago, and I now have a Mapquest printout showing me where to go.  It's <EM>two minutes</EM> by their estimate, whereas my current job is 15-20 minutes away.  This means roughly a half hour extra every day.  It's a wonderful thought.
<P>
My most worrisome notions have been because of <EM><A HREF="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=153046">this node</A></EM>.  I'm worried.  I really am.  I realize that I'm not doing anything truly significant, but I'd like to be, and I don't want to have to put a crimp in any possible interesting stuff I could write while I'm working at this place.  I'm not sure yet what I'll do -- I'm considering the rewrite-bad-parts suggestion seriously.</p>
