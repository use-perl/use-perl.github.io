<p>I had an absolute hissy fit this morning, all internally, due to the length of time I spent in my discrete math class staring at things I already knew.
<P>
I don't think I was actually irritated at the class; it's been the second most interesting class I've ever had.  Mostly, I'm just irritated that everything seems to have become busy work:  Report This, Format That.
<P>
If I could sic perl on it somehow, maybe that would help...but building a 'feed in lines of research, spit out a badly-built but ready-to-edit report' script is far beyond me at this point.
<P>
Regardless, there's good news about my stats class:  The *project* is only worth *5%*.
<P>
I wanted to hit myself a few times for not keeping the syllabus.  I'm fairly sure he'll take it late, but at 5%...!  It's almost not worth bothering with now.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Still...I'm so pleased about the idea I came up with for the project that I'm still going to do it.  I worked most of the basic stuff (standard deviation and all that) out during review time.  I'm going to give stats on *how many problems he assigns per chapter*.  That should get a chuckle out of him.  :)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
My English prof, predictably, gave me until tomorrow.  That should be more than enough; I have basic research done on the report, so now I've just got to actually wrap the whole mess in appropriate English.
<P>
Oh, and the secret project is sleeping, not dead.  I'll get around to it eventually.
<P>
I heartily second <A HREF="http://www.pair.com/pair/current/insider/1201/damianconway.html">everything Damian said</A>, btw.  :D</p>
