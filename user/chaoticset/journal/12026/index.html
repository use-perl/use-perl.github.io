<p>Trying to learn two things at once, I coded a small object system to work as glue between my idea for a word-association-web-page-finder and XML::Simple.
<P>
I've gotten a lot of practice with references as a result, and I needed it.  I'm starting to actually know what's in a data structure when I code them from time to time, mostly because of Data::Dumper.  Frequently, when the data structure doesn't fit right with object or something using the data structure, Dumper is what helps me figure out where I went wrong.  That, plus I've had perlboot, perlbot, and perltoot open during all my coding.
<P>
Probably once I finish working on this I'll post it at the Monastery for a code review.  I could use that; I don't know if my code is as sharp as it was, or if it's actually improved.
<P>
Working more on trying to be hirable.  Anybody got any feedback on _What Color Is Your Parachute_?  I'm reading it currently, and considering using its techniques.</p>

parachute++ ; while it didn't help me find the job I wanted immediately, it put me on the path to finding it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) The exercises in parachute really made me think about what sort of work I would <b>enjoy</b> doing...and that is the key.
