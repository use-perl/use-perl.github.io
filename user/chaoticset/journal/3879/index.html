<p>I had always kind of wondered what the sort in Perl had under the hood.  Now I know.  :)
<P>
It has occurred to me that while Wolf is built to parallel regular algorithm books, Ram is not.  Ram is a collection of ingredients; Wolf is a collection of recipes.  Nothing wrong with either; ingredients often require a certain preparation before use, and improperly prepared ingredients result in botched recipes.  It's important to understand the components as well as the composing.
<P>
In case that seems too simple, consider stock.  Quite a bit can go into stock; yet it is still an ingredient.  There's crossover between the two categories, in the sense that if you're writing a filter you may well just need one or two particularly beefy ingredients ( a couple of regexes), but those same ingredients are in some other, much larger recipe where they are just as necessary, just as useful, and provide the same functionality -- in concert.
<P>
The obverse is true as well:  That some simple "ingredients" like stock can be used almost all by themselves as soups.  Sometimes the algorithm is the whole ball of wax; you <EM>just</EM> need a search function.
<P>
Of course, these are observations from someone who hasn't put a whole project together yet, either.  I'm sure I am missing important points here.
<P>
All I'm saying is that I liked the Wolf book a lot on my first read, and will be chomping through some bits more in my spare time.  I like it enough to keep rereading for a while.
<P>
Thanks, Jarkko, Jon, and John.  :)  (Not in any particular order.)</p>
