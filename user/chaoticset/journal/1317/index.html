<p>PerlMUD worked within twenty minutes of my last journal entry.  I was amazed.  I didn't journal it because I feel like I'm sliding down a slope with my journal entries, way the hell away from anything coding-related, and it bothers me, so this is the last entry for a while about the Secret Project.
<P>
Oh, and my memory.  It's been getting better, something I attribute to the exercise it's been getting.  (That is, when I write notes on the whiteboard and see them, I usually end up remembering the incident.)  The headaches are fewer, too, so I consider it a good thing all around.
<P>
If I knew what caused it in the first place...
<P>
The MUD works, and now I just have to struggle through the creation effort.  What I'd REALLY like to do is write up a script that will construct huge portions of the database FOR me, and I'll probably give that a shot sometime in the next few weeks.
<P>
What else...?
<P>
The CGI script is coming along, hobbling, as usual.  It's hard to focus on with the class stuff that's happening to me lately; my grades have suffered a little bit, so I've naturally shifted the focus.  I absolutely *have* to get decent grades this time.  (Academic probation is something I've become intimately familiar with over the past couple semesters.)
<P>
The script can wait, frankly.  The client doesn't have the hosting, money, etc., so I'm not worried about pushing the deadline.  I realize it's lazy and counter to good design, but, realistically, I cannot sacrifice that wretched piece of paper for some pieces that haven't shown up yet.
<P>
I know, cheaper than therapy.  Back to coding.</p>
