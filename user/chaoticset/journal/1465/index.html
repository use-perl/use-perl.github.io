<p>Okay...Linux From Scratch assumes you have a Linux already set up.  While I suppose it was really the only thing they could do (I mean, they can't tell you to build Linux you have to have Windows or DOS or something, and you've got to have an operating system to operate from) it made me look at it a few times.
<P>
I'm in the process of downloading tom's rtbt, the version you can burn on a CD and work with that way.  That way I can install it, and then, if I can't get Perl working on it, I'll deal with LFS.
<P>
Don't get me wrong -- eventually, probably sometime in January -- whether this works or not, I'll do an LFS installation just to see how it all works.  But for now, I so DESPERATELY don't want to go without perl!
<P>
Suddenly, it occurs to me that I may need to go get dressed.  The SO-TF* is fretting around about what she's wearing, and I keep offering sad noises and words of condolence.  Now, she has come in and stated her choice of clothing.
<P>
"So what are you wearing?"
<P>
I realize I have no idea whatsoever...and in panic, point at my currently-worn bathrobe.
<P>
I have to go find clothes.  The download is at 40%.  (Oh, and I'm downloading tiny linux stuff too.  I'm not just going with toms rtbt!  Please!  Nobody needs to get hurt!)
<P>
Wish me luck with it.
