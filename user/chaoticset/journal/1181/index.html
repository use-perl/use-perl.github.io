<p>Been reading perlmonks.  It's not all sweetness and light, surprise surprise.
<P>
Which is not anything to hold against them; that's just reality.  Just that the things I've been reading on there at this point are...a little upsetting.
<P>
Irrelevant, especially to me, but upsetting nonetheless.
<P>
I have bigger fish to fry, so I'm heating up the grease.  A little draw-and-wipe on the board has convinced me that I really only have to deal with three things that change:
<P>
If the *main page* is what's supposed to come up, the little 'news of the month' file is loaded up and slapped onto the page between the logo at the top and the button array at the bottom.  The button array will just be three graphical buttons marked 'Main', 'Singles', and 'View Cart'.
<P>
If there was no search term last time, and they're at the Singles page, then they get the little explanation about putting a search term in the search box.
<P>
If there WAS a search term, they get that search term's matching stock entries back.
<P>
If there were checked items to add, it adds them, applies a few rules about how many got added and whether they were there or not, and returns a short sentence for each one, above the search term and search results.
<P>
If they're at the cart page, and there's nothing in their cart, spit out 'Nothing in cart.'
<P>
If they're at the cart page and there IS something in their cart, it brings up cost values from the stock file and builds a small table, showing costs for each item, that quantity of each item, and then the subtotal and final total with shipping and handling.  Under that will be all the "how you gonna pay for that, slick?" fill-in boxes, and a confirm button.  If they confirm, there's a quick check for CC verification (either through numerical check routines - I've seen them in places - or else through an honest-to-God CC verifier that you can purchase the services of for your scripts.  I don't know which is a better idea yet) and then it spits out a print-friendly page to the customer, creates an invoice file for our records, and deletes the cart file.
<P>
Crap.  I didn't explain it any better than last time.
<P>
Well, I took photos of my diagrams, so I should have *some* idea of what I'm doing.
<P>
I'm debating about doing code tonight or tomorrow.  I'm going to try to build the navbuttons and logo functions tonight, just because they seem easy.</p>
