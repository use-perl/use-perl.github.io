<p>I'm looking for a tiny keyboard.
<p>
This isn't really about my laptop needs (although it would be nice to have a single interface device I could use for both my laptop and home computer, and just cart it off when I take my laptop) so much as my current level of desk space.
<p>
Plus, I essentially don't play PC games at all any more, which means I don't need to have all this extra crap floating around on my keyboard -- I pretty much just need the letters, the numbers, the symbols and Ctrl, Alt, Delete, Enter, Shift, and Caps Lock.  (I also don't boot into Windows much now, which means I rarely need to reboot, which...well, the benefits of that are rather obvious, I'm sure.)
<p>
So I'm hoping to find a tiny (like, less space than a sheet of paper) keyboard, and hoping it can be wireless, and hoping it can lack pointing devices.  So far I've found one that's tiny and wireless and includes a pointing device, and one that's tiny and corded with no pointing device, but not quite what I need.
<p>
Any recommendations?  I only seem to come here and post now when I've got questions about equipment, sadly.  :\</p>

</p> <p>Happy Hacking has some small ones as well. I would just Google for "small wireless keyboard".</p>

I saw the Happy Hacking ones, but I can't justify the cost to Reabena.
<p>
Whereas the <a href="http://www.fentek-ind.com/wireless.htm#kbmw" title="fentek-ind.com">MINI WIRELESS KEYBOARD</a fentek-ind.com> at Fentek seems to fill the bill precisely -- no mousing device, all the necessary keys, wireless.  And it's fifty bucks.

Thank you for the link.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

</ul>

<p>Both pretty expensive, though.</p>
