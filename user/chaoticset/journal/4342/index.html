<p>I don't remember where I heard that.
<P>
I have -- due to circumstances that are really mostly beyond my control -- been unable to snork as much of my yummy new books as I'd liked, to my great chagrin.
<P>
Tomorrow, unfortunately, I must build a "site" for my introductory web design class.  This "site" must include examples of various HTML structures, some JavaScript (to prove we weren't sleeping when the teacher talked about it) and some graphics and sounds.  That's it.
<P>
The trick is doing that without letting the baby-sat ones kill each other.  Most of the time they're well-behaved, but they know how to push <EM>each other's</EM> buttons, and that's the problem.  
<P>
Despite this, I managed to read through some of Emu, getting to the grid stuff.  Slow going if I don't have a 'puter to fiddle with code right after reading; tomorrow, though, I should have my machine freed up while they peruse a film or two.
<P>
For now, though, I'm going to curl up with Karamel Sutra and the Camel.  :)</p>

It was Winston Churchill.  Oh, and it was "History", not "Time".
<p>
Sorry - I'm in "trivia mode" at the moment.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
