<p>I Super Searched the monastery for how to file-lock database files, and the wide range of bizarre comments makes me think it's wise to look at that as one of the last things to resolve.
<P>
Gotta add the drop-into-cart code, still.
<P>
Gotta figure out what to have for tests for that, too.
<P>
Mainly just wanted to note the database flocking thing.  Perhaps I should check up on that in _Nutshell_ -- perhaps this is one of those (few) things that the monastery just happens to be (deficient|ambiguous) about.</p>

You mentioned you still had a cookbook on CD, right?

Wonderful!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Thank you very much.  There's so much stuff on the _Bookshelf_ CD...I wonder what else I'm missing that I currently need.
<p>
(I would never sell a book I didn't still have a copy of.  It hurts to think I'm selling the only *paper* copy I have of the Cookbook, even though I know the CD is equivalent.)</p>

Cookbook was the first Perl book I bought - learned my initial Perl from that and programs. That said, I'd be fine selling it now because I never use the paper version. Of the books on the CD, I only use the paper Nutshell (which is somewhat heavily annotated).
<br>
<br>(Mind you, for books I've not got on CD, I have somewhat heavy use sometimes.)
<br>
<br>What would be nice is an editor that can note what a scalar is blessed as and produce the appropriate documentation on its methods. Due to Perl's somewhat flexible OO nature I suspect such a program would be a headache to write. (As you don't know exactly what something is until the program is actually run.)
