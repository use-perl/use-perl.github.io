<p>I've had some actual development going on of late.
<p>
Since I've been spending a truckload of time at school (or waiting for the car to be repaired, damnable machine), I've had plenty of time to haul out my laptop and pound away at various things.  One of those things is my Java class, and the other is MaLToL.
<p>
Discussions with the professor currently acting as my advisor have led to interesting results -- one of which is that I am <em>now</em> officially in the <em>Baccalaureate</em> program.  Yes.  I'm going for the full four years!  I'm actually really excited about this, even though it means I'll be doing a lot of non-Perl things for a while for school.  I'm hoping to do plenty of them on my own time or within some form of employment.
<p>
Progress is slow but steady.  Trying to keep myself to writing tests first, and trying to keep myself writing only one or two at a time.  (Of course, I don't really have any experience with extreme programming in a "formalized" environment -- whatever that is defined as -- so if I seem to have any misconceptions or a lack of understanding, feel free to clear it up for me.  :)  )</p>
