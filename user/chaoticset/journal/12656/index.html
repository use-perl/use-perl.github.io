<p>Okay -- it's an inaccurate title, but I can't be bothered to come up with something clever this early in the morning.
<P>
The Register has <A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/30621.html">a</A> <A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/35/31070.html">couple</A> stories on the Google-Blog situation.
<P>
"What Google-Blog situation?" I hear you cry.  READ!  Read the links!  Googlebombing, Googlewhacking, etc.  Blogs skew Google.
<P>
The Register carries on about this as if somehow the blogging community is a pile of whiny brats, which seems a little unfair -- bloggers hacked Google.  Simply put, they figured a trick out, and they did it a few times, and now all the -- forgive this mangling -- 'skript bloggers' have come out of the woodwork.
<P>
They seem to advocate some sort of separated Google for blogs, which I don't think is a half bad idea.  However...where is the dividing line?
<P>
Is this a blog?  Or does the fact that it's not subdomained somehow make it more palatable?  How do you separate the blogs from the rest?
<P>
And, more importantly, who decides what the dividing line is?  Why can't people spoof that dividing line?  Once that gets out, why won't all these disillusioned bloggers, led to the spoof information by Google itself, use it to spoof Google?
<P>
So Google will start non-linking to information about spoofing Google, and the vicious cycle starts...
<P>
Goodbye, Google.  You will be missed.  You will never be as we knew you.
<P>
In other news (ha ha) <A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/51/31020.html">the United States has the lowest software piracy rate of any country</A>.  I'm really very curious how they measure this -- is it by the number of people getting caught?  Some sort of anonymous survey?
<P>
If it's the number of people getting caught, then, perhaps, we've just adapted to become very <EM>smart</EM> pirates in the U.S.
<P>
Oh, and did I mention there's working <A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/31077.html">quantum cryptography</A>?  Next week will no doubt bring <A HREF="http://www.its.caltech.edu/user/qoptics/teleport.html">teleportation</A>.</p>
