<p>Well, if I wasn't going to school and worrying about school constantly I would have time to realize I'm not writing any more and then beat up on myself about it.
<P>
Good thing I'm going this semester.
<P>
Tomorrow's homework is done already; it just needs to be on a disk and handed in tomorrow.  I don't have my homework for Tuesday done yet, but I fully expect to do it Monday after class.
<P>
Ended up watching a large part of _Blade Runner_ today when I found it on USA.  Mistake.  First, it wasn't widescreen; second, it wasn't director's cut.  Still, it made me remember how much I liked the movie and how well-put-together it seemed.
<P>
It also made me wonder why the future is always being depicted as either radically cleaner or radically filthier than modern times.  Perhaps that's an echo of the percieved cleanliness of small towns compared to large cities, but that's purely psychological.  Small towns really aren't any cleaner; there's just less town to notice the dirtiness of.
<P>
I should know.  I spent over ten years living in a town with a population of fifty or so; out of those fifty, I can personally vouch that we had alcoholics, pederasts, senility, drug use...all those high-falutin' things normally found where you can find malls.
<P>
And no, I'm not a senile, alcoholic, drug-addicted pederast.  :P</p>

You know, I'm sure I <b>must</b> be in the minority here but I really didn't think Blade Runner was that good really.  Just like The Matrix.  It too was ok but nowhere near as good as the hype made it out to be.

Perhaps, but it is more entertaining and interesting than discussions about why it is or isn't entertaining or interesting.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
