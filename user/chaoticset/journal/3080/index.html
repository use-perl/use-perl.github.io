<p>Tentatively named Yazouza (someone typoed in a channel and it seemed to like the word), the bot is being modified in two directions now.
<P>
I'm still adding Engrishy changes, but I'm also adding a different class of word-changing, the kind that produces purposeful pseudo-Japanese.  The combination of the two makes it seem like some deranged parrot or something, trying to speak two languages and getting neither right.
<P>
I'll suppress all the "c00l" stuff when I release the plugin, but for now it's entertaining.  :)
<P>
I didn't get the DJGPP stuff set up...but I <EM>did</EM> get the new discrete math quiz downloaded.  Haven't looked at it yet; it's due by the coming Wednesday, so there's lots of time.
<P>
I've been sort of interested in XML since I first heard about it; I guess I'll poke around a few docs and get an idea of whether it's something I need to know more about soon.
<P>
Gotta do a quick shoot with the camera tomorrow; my father and his wife are looking into buying a house up here, and they want me to get shots of it, inspect it for damage, etc., and give them the pictures.  If there's anything worth looking at or particularly lovely I'll probably make sure to get a good shot of it.</p>
