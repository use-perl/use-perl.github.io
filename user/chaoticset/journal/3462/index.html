<p>I guess I need to get the Wolf Book.  :)
<P>
Had I seen it on a shelf somewhere I'd have picked it up by now, no doubt.  I'll probably have to order it; the most advanced thing on the shelf of the local Borders is _Bookshelf_, which I have already.
<P>
The sickness is abating; I suspect it'll be done by the end of today or mid-tomorrow, and that means back to the grindstone.  Halfway through _Man-Month_, but I'm not doing the depthful reading of my youth, so I should probably make myself go back and read again.</p>

<h2>Bookstore prices?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2002-03-12T16:36:33</h3>
Why pay bookstore prices when you can get it for so much less online?  I usually use Bookpool.com - they've never failed me.
<p>
For a comparative price search, use bestbookbuys.com
</p><p>
You might find a little cheaper than Bookpool, but if it's only a $1 difference, I'd recommend using Bookpool.</p>

And if you're on the East coast, bookpool is a huge win because they're in MA, not CA.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
&lt;rant&gt;<br>
Shipping from CA just sucks! It takes too darn long, and it's more expensive. Why aren't there more places that ship from the East coast? Are we not people too? Does my money not spend as well? At least Netflix is shipping some titles from Worchester now.
<br>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>
