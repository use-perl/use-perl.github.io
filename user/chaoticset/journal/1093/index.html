<p>Well, if it were something so simple as just typing it in and watching it work, I wouldn't need to learn how to do it right...right?
<P>
I've finally hit a stride of sorts with this:  Bring up the page, attempt to access the script, bring up the error log, fix those errors, rinse, and repeat.  Time to debug.
<P>
Okay...fiddle fiddle fiddle.  Realize I wrote the *loop* for this in one place and the code in another; combine and rip out some common elements.  Declare one of my stupid variables and run.
<P>
A whole series of these pop up:<BR>
[Sun Oct 28 12:44:43 2001] [error] [client 63.17.150.189] File does not exist: c:/program files/apache group/apache/htdocs/scripts/root.exe
<P>
To which I can only mirror my internal reaction:  "HUH?!"
<P>
I may not know what caused *those* errors, but I can safely assume something is wrong with what I'm trying to do.  Near the end of the ten or so errors is this very understandable line:<BR>
[Sun Oct 28 13:03:30 2001] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] Missing $ on loop variable at c:\PROGRA~1\APACHE~1\APACHE\CGI-BIN\CARTER.PL line 111.
<P>
I've found that when I fix the errors that make sense, the nonsensical (to me) ones tend to fall away as well.  But I didn't write a new loop...!
<P>
I found the problem immediately; it was a line or two above.  A naked 'for' statement, an aborted thought halfway through my fingers.
<P>
Backspace, backspace, backspace.  Gone.
<P>
Run...and...
<P>
Crap.  Two pertinent errors stand out on this one:
<P>
[Sun Oct 28 13:04:25 2001] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] main::get_cart_name() called too early to check prototype at c:\PROGRA~1\APACHE~1\APACHE\CGI-BIN\CARTER.PL line 93.
<BR>
[Sun Oct 28 13:04:25 2001] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] Global symbol "$card" requires explicit package name at c:\PROGRA~1\APACHE~1\APACHE\CGI-BIN\CARTER.PL line 132.
<P>
Huh.  I thought you could put subs anywhere and the script would handle it, but if it says it wants that earlier, I won't argue.  I move get_cart_name above where it's called.
<P>
Where I had 'my $card', I changed it to 'my $cart', because I *thought* I had weeded out all uses of $card.  I was wrong, it seems.  Fixed.
<P>
Let's see what happens...
<P>
...hm.  Page hasn't loaded yet.  Another friggin' infinity problem.
<P>
I'm going to the prompt for this one, since it seems to help with these.
<P>
Well, that and I'm going to get some real food.  Peanut butter on whole-wheat toast is a nice little fake breakfast, but my body is crying out for at least some ramen.  Kitchen time, then prompt this problem out of my life.</p>
