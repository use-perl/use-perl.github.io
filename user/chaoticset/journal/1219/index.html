<p>Today I went and talked to the school's network guru about the network that's set up there, and I now officially know that network guru isn't a job I want.  (Well, it would be better than 95% of what is out there, but I suspect it would bore me and jobs that bore me tend to make me burn things.)
<P>
On the other hand, I also now know much, much more about the network at the campus.  It's all for a lovely report, and my erstwhile colleague in education (read:  the guy I got assigned to do the report with) suggested that all my photos and some other stuff made the report a natural for web site presentation.
<P>
"Where are we going to host that?"
<P>
He's got ideas, blah blah blah.  I say I'll email him.  I will, but I don't know that it's a good idea.  (Although it would make presentation ultra-easy:  "Here's the URL, people...at the opening page, you'll see a link called 'First Glance'...")
<P>
I spent some time fiddling with my code, and decided I needed to write down all these functions as I *imagine* them directly, using the best syntax I can do off the top of my head, and then print the whole mess and work the code together from that.
<P>
It's not great, but it should work.  And working is the primary criteria for everything in my life these days.
<P>
What else...?
<P>
I'm looking at the possibility of a fairly sweet sort-of-part-time-job-to-make-money kind of thing.  There's a small organization that does mystery shopping for local businesses, and I'm probably going to try to do it.
<P>
I WANT MY CODE FINISHED!
<P>
Sorry.  I get easily frustrated these days.
<P>
Right, back to the <B>Bookshelf</B> and PFE.  (Programmer's File Editor.  I don't have any clue how good it is compared to anything else - I just wanted a beefed-up Notepad, and this seems to be it.)
<P>
<B>Bookshelf</B>, PFE, and more pizza, that is.</p>
