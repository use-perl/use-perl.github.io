<p>Well, there's certainly been no end of things <EM>happening</EM> to me, and no end of things I've been <EM>doing</EM>, but few are appropriate for what I've determined I'm going to use this journal-space for (school, Perl, and internship stuff).
<P>
First, I missed the first meeting of my database class.  It's via CCTV at my school, so there's a tape of the class -- but one of the other students took it and fell down a well or ate the tape or something, because they've just vanished.  Yay.
<P>
Second, I haven't been Perling all that much.  Sad to say, I just haven't had a lot of time to crack the Camel open the past few weeks, between a minor attempt to acquire a social life (with some folks from work) and some more serious attempts to cross-train in other languages (Python, C++, Ruby).
<P>
Third, my internship hasn't started.  I got a letter from the person who'll be my direct superior (and, it seems, may be the only other person working there in this capacity...I was aware it was a small school, but I didn't think it was this small).  I am fingerprinted now, so that hurdle's been cleared, but there's still approval that I have to gain from Augusta, etc., bureaucratic la-dee-dah.  Time is the only thing which cuts through red tape.
<P>
On the up side, I did actually manage to catch up on a large chunk of journal entries.  (I have almost everybody at the site set as a friend, and my prefs are set to send email every time a friend writes another journal entry.  I had 186 entries stacked up in my Unread folder.  It's down to 50, and I plan to hit those soon.)
<P>
Not a lot of journalling...because there's not a lot to journal.  :\</p>
