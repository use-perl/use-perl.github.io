<p>Things are sweet.  I'm settling into my new home.
<p>
Since I essentially don't play PC games any more, I have no real need to boot into WinME.  It's pretty nice.
<p>
I've finally gotten around to configuring my desktop the way I like and slapping a coat of wallpaper on that drab gray backdrop.  Per my new interest in <em>Samurai Champloo</em>, I have Jin as my WinME wallpaper and Mugen as my Slackware.  (Of course, once I install Debian on here as well, I'll need to find a wallpaper of Fuu.)
<p>
In biologically oriented news, R's knee was been checked out by an orthopedic surgeon yesterday.  His detailed analysis consisted of a "sunset" x-ray of the knee, examination of the charts, a determination that everything's basically okay and that R can begin to bear weight on the knee, and...and inappropriate comment about her weight.  Well, scratch that -- it was appropriate.  It was a little more glib than he might have intended, however.
<p>
It wasn't so offensive as to cause crying so much as anger, which was fine.  R doesn't get much flak about this from people that I see or hear, but I know she <em>thinks</em> it.
<p>
Other good news -- saw her regular doc this morning, and she's apparently lost 20 pounds since the last visit, which was about two months ago.  This is amazingly good news; more downward traffic will help her knee recover and hopefully turn her back from the brink of diabetes.
<p>
Speaking of which, I am currently about twenty glucose points higher than my doc wants, so I'm cutting out the bulk of starch in my diet.  (Most of the sugar was already gone.)  I am still losing weight, which is great and wonderful, etc., but no longer significant to me, because I have zero hunger awareness now.  I have to make sure I eat protein, and there's still food I <em>like</em> to eat, but I don't consciously get hungry.  And, if I distract myself with something, I can usually forget about food for at least a whole day.
<p>
My burn is healing up well.  Almost all the blisters are gone, and now it's just a matter of time while the last open spots scab/crust and then the skin tries to knit itself back together properly.
<p>
And now, a haiku of frustration:
<blockquote>
Google Summer Of Code<br>
I wish I could do it, but<br>
My ideas just suck
</blockquote></p>
