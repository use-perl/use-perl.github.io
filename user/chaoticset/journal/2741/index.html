<P>
That is part of the new KaZaA license and, I suspect, a result of NSW's ludicrous stupidity.
<P>
I have an idea!  Let's just block anybody in NSW from access to anything.  I don't mean physically; just cut their access to the net off to as many servers as possible.  I see no reason not to indulge their deranged little urges.  If I were an ISP, I would see it as protection from idiotic enforcement attempts.
<P>
To hell with them if they have no sense of humor or proportion.</p>

(I live nearish the border.)
<br>
<br>What's so special about NSW law that makes it attractive to KaZaa? And/or makes it so unattractive to you?

And what legal material is actually on KaZaa?
<br>
<br>That is, of the stuff that isn't actually evidence of breach of copyright what remains?
<br>
<br>As an author (of programs generally) I like to have my copyright respected, even if my licenses tend to say 'give it away! give it to everyone you know!'.
<br>
<br>While I think the bill is silly, and that KaZaa using it doesn't really help KaZaa, I also think KaZaa, Morpheus and others are also silly.
<br>
<br>It's mostly a case of: if I ever produce something that is likely to end up on KaZaa or a KaZaa-alike service I don't want it on KaZaa or a KaZaa-alike service. I'm capitalist scum and want money damnit =)
<br> <br>That said, I don't actually hold too much interest in it all at the moment =) I was only really vaguely curious.

It was a quick overreaction on my part, now that hindsight has been applied.  It just bothers me that there's the <em>faint</em> possibility I could end up in a NSW court someday.

If I break the majority of licenses around, I'd theoretically be in a US court. It's a long trip =) And our dollar sucks.
