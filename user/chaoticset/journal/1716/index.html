<p>It's always good to get something written down, something noted so that you can examine your perspective more thoroughly.  I was losing it this morning -- over a test!
<P>
I mean, it's a *serious* test, it's not good that I didn't do well on it...but I haven't freaked out about any test, for any friggin' reason, for years.  It was nice to never have 'test anxiety' or whatever the hell it's called now.
<P>
I suppose I need to spend a little more time in the relax rooms put together in one of the campus halls.  Little fountains to listen to, little dishes of candy, lots of tastefully placed lighting and couches.
<P>
I feel even stranger finding what I had forgotten about my networking class:  There IS NO FINAL.  I've been fretting about that for days, I thought today was the day, and the teacher sent email back:  There is no final.
<P>
I just about wanted to cry, I was so happy.
<P>
None of this matters anymore.  I have a send-in discrete math exam to deal with, and then I have to get to sleep.
<P>
Oh, and I actually have *plans* for the script; it hasn't been forgotten, just ignored for a few days while I attempt to get a little closer to a piece of paper.
<P>
First, there's the matter of how I was handling the 'put this in the cart' boxes.  Kludgily, I had built a hidden index tag to measure the length of the list, and then a complex set of conditionals to figure out whether a single box was checked and what was in it, interating through a counter variable, which had to also be counted when *generating* the boxes, etc.
<P>
Then someone told me that you can get all the parameters, in an array, by going param().
<P>
I was told this just before I implemented the cart-generating stuff, so I actually learned how to get param(), then strip out all the values I don't want, and generating them with a key word in front, blah blah blah.  I just never got around to fixing it for the search results.  Should obviate the need for about 1/3rd of the ifs I have in there now.
<P>
What else...well, of course, I have to get the cart removal working.  (That is, there has to be a way to remove things from your cart, or at least start over.  How frustrating to put fifteen or twenty distinct cards in an order and have to start over because you added one too many of one of them!  Not a good idea.)  I figured I could make things easy on myself by having a 'take one out' box, instead of 'Remove?' and having them enter a number to remove.  I was wrong; whatever I did to remove them from the cart doesn't work, and the part that adds them back to the inventory doesn't work either.  Also, I got a little confused as to where to place it in the timeline of a single page being generated, but I suspect my whiteboard will clear that up once I retrieve it from the trunk of my car.
<P>
Right, sorry, boot.  Boot of my car.
<P>
Anyway, I just wanted to reiterate (to myself, mostly) that I hadn't forgotten about this thing, and there's not any good reason *to* forget about it.  School's almost out, and after the holidays it's going to be full-tilt coding while I've got spare time to fully tilt within.
<P>
I'm really, really hoping to pull a little spare cash together and give something back to perl, but I'm not sure if I can.  I hate saying 'no' to anyone or anything -- goes against my naturally accepting nature -- but the money may just not be there.
<P>
I hope it is.  I wouldn't trade my time with this language for anything; I'd like to further it at least a little bit.</p>
