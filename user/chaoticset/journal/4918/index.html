<p>Good news is just raining down.  I'm trying to figure out if I missed the first meeting of my 232 class (which, unfortunately, I think I did), and I found the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This course will begin with a brief overview of Linux, the operating system of choice. If you love Microsoft, be sure you're well-armed. Verbally, that is. 
We will learn how to do many things in Perl at the command-line level before moving to writing scripts for the web that allow you to interact with the user and provide them a truly unique experience. 
We will end the course with a basic introduction to SQL through the use of MySQL on Linux. We will use Perl and MySQL to store and retrieve lots of information we can use for (and against) the web user.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Further, I'm led to believe that the books for the course are (drum roll please)... _Learning Perl_ and _CGI Programming With Perl_!
<P>
I still have to email the teacher and find out what I missed, but I think I'm about to have the best class of my academic career.  :)  Summer's looking better and better...</p>

<p>What school is that, what's the class, and what do I need to do to enroll?</p>

In order:  University Campus at Bangor, the bastard child of the University Of Maine system; 232 CGI In Perl (or some name roughly equivalent to that); you'd need to be in the Bangor, Maine area or else wait for it to be offered via UCB's fairly new system for web-classes.
<p>
Assuming they offer it again.  I've been reading the docs the teacher put up, and either he was expecting to do the class last year fall, or else they've done the class before.  (The schedules and class catalog are indeed so precarious that something might be offered once and never again.)</p>
