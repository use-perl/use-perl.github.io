<p>Well, based on the notion that either
<P>
A:  We'll get to use one of the Cl**ster legacy lists
<P>
or
<P>
B:  We'll get to use the Cl**ster software itself
<P>
I'm going to build a little script to take a Cl**ster list, strip out the rares, strip out extraneous information, and leave a list of rare names, average prices, and slots for pricemodding as the owner sees fit.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I explained how Cl**ster lists work, and he asked me if they're ever way, way off.  I told him that they were sometimes (and sometimes slightly ambiguous...if you play the game and you've heard of Arabian Nights, then you might know why Mountain occasionally sells for a big chunk of cash, but all the other land cards (Island, Forest, etc.) usually average under a dollar).  He said he wanted to be able to override the base list on specific cards if possible.  I said that wouldn't be a problem - just a few more lines in the scripts that convert the lists.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Essentially, this should be 'read in a line from the rares list, check for a matching line in the price list, if there is one slap it into another file with a little changing'.  That is, it shouldn't be too too difficult.
<P>
Last famous words.
<P>
The CGI has become the last thing on my mind at this point; once the scripts that compile the lists are put together and operational, there shouldn't be a lot the CGI will have to do; just build a table, slap about three values into it, and voila.  The hard stuff is in the compilation scripts.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I miss moxperl.  Wish it was still going.
