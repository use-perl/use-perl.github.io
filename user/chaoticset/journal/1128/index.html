<p>Well, it's not *quite* doing what I need.
<P>
Morning coffee helps anything, right?
<P>
Anyway, I checked it out.  Some of my error messages, upon consideration, aren't quite what the client's going to need.  (The errors file used to say "$name is misspelled!" when a card from the inventory/stock file wouldn't match something in the Cl**ster file.)  I'd found that Cl**ster has a few errors [missing commas!] and that the thing I'm using to make inventory files does too [missing LETTERS].  These are few and far between, though, so I just wanted to make sure the client was aware.  That way he could go in and set his own prices.  (The new message is "$name did not match to a price."  I'll probably make it longer when I get around to it, but that should hold for now.)
<P>
Other than that and a few little nits here and there, it's working and worked out.  On to the CGI!
<P>
*shudder*
<P>
The CGI *FROM HELL*.
<P>
Okay, from HECK, I guess, but still.
<P>
I've added the code that should handle the newest stock files (but won't, goddamnit) and I just need to start testing runs.
<P>
The Apache logfiles have some weird things occasionally.  I keep getting those 'cannot find file' errors I mentioned earlier, except they're intermittant(sp?) and I don't understand them.  If I did, I'd try to fix them.  Since they don't seem to be breaking anything, I won't screw with it.
<P>
Testing, testing...brew more coffee...</p>
