<p>Filehandle functions?  Check.
<P>
Putting the file into the @cards array?  Check.  (It prints properly with print (@cards);, which I didn't think it was supposed to.)
<P>
Splitting properly?  Are you splitting by whitespace or something else equally inane?  Nope, it looks right - but it doesn't WORK.
<P>
All I get from running the program as it appears it SHOULD run to me is uninitalized variable errors in my format lines and the one line where I use the variables $name, $stock, and $shown - all of which are DECLARED at the beginning of the program with my.
<P>
Obnoxious.
<P>
However, I believe there's a way around it.  I'll just declare those variables *INSIDE* the function.  I don't need them outside of it; I declared them globally because I always had trouble with local/global and variable assignment before, when I was working with...
<P>
...uh, let's not go there.  Kind of embarrassing.
<P>
Anyway, the point is, I *think* I have a solution.  (I really really don't think the code for the sort/insertion is going to be hard at all.  Now that I know how to stick a value onto the end of the array, I just need to figure out how to work that whole circular-revolving list thingie, shift, I think, and it's essentially done.)
<P>
And to think you have a solution is to be partially there.</p>
