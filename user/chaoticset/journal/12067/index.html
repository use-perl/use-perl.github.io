Ah, well.  If whatever I'm doing is already half implemented into a module on CPAN, that means it was a good idea, and that a better version of it's probably already been written by someone else.
<P>
FIDO continues.  I'm focusing on whatever I've got to do to documents to make them conform to my arbitrary notion of homogeneity (lowercase, no punctuation, underscores between certain terms to provide two-word functionality, etc.) because it sounds like the funnest part of the work, really.  The interface is probably going to be more boring.
<P>
I wrote for a few moments tonight, wrote English sentences strung together.  They're arranged roughly as the beginning of a short film script, and it may well be a workable idea if I can write the whole thing.
<P>
I've gotten one of the new <A HREF="http://www.dunkindonuts.com/images/catalog/product_catalog/item_sippers_s.jpg">Dunkin' Donuts frozen coffee mugs</A>, and let me tell you, this is what I envisioned when my history prof said:  "More More More, Now Now Now."  :D  It's the size of my head, maybe bigger.  This is a great, wonderful, absolutely lovable mug, and I'm not just referring to the fact that it's apparently heat-tolerating enough to steep tea in (although that's a great thing about it, believe me) but the fact that it's just FUCKING HUGE.  If I fill it first thing in the morning, I have a beverage the whole rest of the day.  It takes roughly 96.5% of a 2L bottle of Dew, meaning there's enough for a starter gulp left in the bottle.  It's so pretty to take one long swig from the bottle, then overturn it into the mug and watch it all drain in <EM>and it all fits</EM>.  Sigh.  Loving sigh.
<P>
I made myself a 12 ounce glass of cola product today, and it just didn't feel right.  I drank, it was gone...I felt empty, alone, confused, broken.  The Mug Is Superior.
<P>
I've considered going to a bar with it and asking if I can get a rum and coke that size.
<P>
Oh, gracious Chao!  A 64 ounce rum and coke!  If my faraway dream of owning a beach ever happens, I shall sit on the beach and listen to the water while I sip from that wondrous mug a rum and coke (or possible Barq's and Bacardi) mixture, and heady shall my thoughts become.
<P>
In other news, my birthday is the day before _Matrix Reloaded_ comes out, so there's a fair chance that I'll get dragged down to the movie even if I don't want to be.  Ah, well.  Worse things have happened to me.  I saw X2 on premiere night, and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  (Premiere night, not the film.  The film was about as good as I expected it to be.)
<P>
Laura's seeing a new guy, and it's...well, it's a little strange here and there, but she seems pretty happy, and he's a very nice guy.  It feels weird, yeah -- but it's a good weird, like when I tried peanut butter and bacon sandwiches a few weeks ago.  (They're remarkably tasty, in case you're curious.  Not even really an acquired taste -- just try it sometime, you'll like it, probably.)
<P>
I'm trying to stay focused on the code, seriously.
<P>
I figured out while sketching a new chunk of the module that I had some options -- build a super object to contain both a likemap and a wordmap, or else build likemaps as wordmaps.  (The first option's probably best, because that way I can build docmaps as crazy and disorganized as they'll need to be for my nefarious scheme.  The problem is that my notion of encapsulation isn't the best yet, but I'm working on it.)   Basically, separate the important bits of Wordmap into Map, then have submap objects Word, Like, Doc, etc.
<P>
I fired up a wiki clone on my perlmonk.org account, but I'm not posting its location here.  It's not meant for public consumption, really -- just for note-taking while I'm away from home.  I haven't done enough with it to find it truly useful just yet, but that will follow.</p>
