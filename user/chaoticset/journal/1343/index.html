<p>I got lucky.  (There are those who believe luck is just the intersection of patience and preparation; who am I to argue with them?)
<P>
Some things can only be so f*cked up and do what they're supposed to do.
<P>
I was going to attempt an analogy, but it's better to explain.  (Especially for myself.)
<P>
I had this problem:  How do I make a subroutine stop iterating across a list of checkbox values once it's reached the end?  As far as I can tell, if there's a checkbox that's not checked, it doesn't return anything that I could look for to indicate that the list is still going but not checked at that point.
<P>
I had some funky-ass nested IF and UNTIL statements, trying to check for the existence of something and then for a slapdash 'ending value' I was artificially inserting into each page.  I had noted (rightfully!) that I would have to fix it someday, because it was sloppy, but hadn't changed it because there was no better alternative coming to mind.
<P>
"Gee," I mused, "wouldn't it be ultra-helpful if I had that checkbox info in a hash, so I could just check keys and all that?"  I nodded to myself.
<P>
"But how would I fill a hash with the info?  What would I set value names to?"  Blah, blah, etc., etc., and then something odd occurred to me:  I'm *counting* how many times there's a checkbox dumped onto the previous page.
<P>
Why not store that in a hidden value?
<P>
If it works like I think it will, this will fix the last problem with the cart checker *and* allow me to move up to my security issues, which definately need dealing with.
<P>
I got lucky on this one because I was moments away from deciding that I wasn't getting any work done and, therefore, should just go to bed.  (I probably should anyway, but the hell with it.  I believe it was Erdos who always said that 'there will be time to rest in the grave'.)
<P>
I'm going to be so glad to be done with this thing.  I honestly found it hard to believe I've been doing this thing for over <B>three months now</B>.  It will feel like a little slice of heaven to watch this thing operate; it will make me smile all the time for a week; it will make me want to kiss people.
<P>
For now...it just makes me want to be done.</p>

<h2>Iterating over Parameters</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2001-11-23T05:47:52</h3>
If I follow what you mean, here are two things that could come in handy.  First, CGI::param() returns a list of the form parameter names, if you pass it no arguments.  Combine that with a grep, and you can pick out all parameters that begin with 'card_', for example.
<p>
Of course, if you give the same name to all of the checkboxes in a group, you can call CGI::param() with the name and assign the results to an array.  That'll give you all the values.
</p><p>
Iterating over an array is easy.</p>
