<p>In a mood tonight.  Feeling better than earlier today, or last night;  my foul mood seems to have mostly lifted.  Good thing, too.
<P>
Learning about CGI::Application, specifically how to combine it with HTML::Template.  Call me crazy, but this looks like a fairly powerful solution I'd be able to use anywhere that provides Perl at all.  (Mason and Embperl and whatnot all seem to require lots of other funky things (and yes, I realize Mason can be used as a straightforward template solution, but I don't want to do that, it feels like a waste) or else have a learning curve I haven't quite managed to travel much of yet.  (Despite being essentially finished with my first reading of the Mason book, I still have these very vague notions of what I can do with it, and my urges waver between wanting to learn how to use Bricolage and wanting to learn how to use Mason itself.  It won't go away, but for now I want some quick results, plus I've been meaning to get around to fiddling with CGI::Application for a while now.)
<P>
Felt like tossing _On The Night_ into the CD player tonight.  I haven't listened to it in ages, and I realize now that I kinda miss it.  Haunting in places and cavalier in others.  :)
<P>
Not really tired.  Felt tired all day at work.  Cranky is a very understated way of putting how I was -- I was actively angry with just about everybody I had to talk with, and that makes for a bad, bad day sometimes.  I got lucky this time.
<P>
I spoke with my father last night, and he tried again to convince me I should be writing.  I'm not at all convinced.</p>

I hope you share some more of your thoughts about CGI::Application and HTML::Template in your blog space here.  I'd be interested in hearing about your experiences with it.  I think the demo I'm working on right now would be well suited for the combination if it goes into development, and any lessons, advice or otherwise I can gather between now and then would be terribly useful.<br> <br>Good luck!<br>CromeDome

You don't have to applogize for using CGI::Application and HTML::Template!  I've been using them together since the day they came out on everything from tiny 100 line CGIs to 30,000 line mod_perl applications.  During that time I've seen a lot of Mason, but I can't say I've liked what I've seen!
<p>
Welcome aboard.

Not so much an apology as an explanation -- I had just picked up the Mason book, so it seems odd that I might suddenly be "switching tracks".
<p>
I don't see it as that, frankly.  I see it as different tools for different jobs.  I don't see why I can't standardize my use of CGI with CGI::Application and my use of HTML through HTML::Template, considering that they're both pretty easy to have anywhere.
</p><p>
However, should I need to have components that stay in memory for quick use and work in a mod_perl-enabled environment, I'll look at Mason.  (And I'm drooling over the screenshots from Bricolage, I just haven't found the time.)
</p><p>
Nothing wrong with either approach -- each has problem spaces they appear to be well-suited to.  I already know HTML::Template fairly well, though, and I'd like to make something that's visible quickly.  I'll take the tool I know and add the tool I think I understand a little bit and throw them together, instead of grabbing something that requires a lot more installation savvy than I currently have and mucking around in it, almost completely unawares of what I'm doing.  I'll fart around with Mason someday soon, and when I do, I'll walk away from it with an understanding, and I'll use that for something informal, and I'll gain applied knowledge from that...and the rest, as they say, is history.
</p><p>
Excellent module, BTW.  I used it to turn in my final project for my Perl class a while back, a quick little Slashdot knockoff.  Thank you very much.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
