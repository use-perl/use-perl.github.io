<p>...from my useless brother that I don't want to end up like him.
<P>
It looks very much like I'm going to spend the rest of the day dealing with his inability to work in Office and his inability to write efficiently by doing these things *for* him.  (How someone can learn English but not know their way around Office, when they *own a laptop with it*, is beyond me.)
<P>
There's a Heinlein(I believe) quote to the effect that if you don't know simple mathematics, you're essentially a housebroken monkey.  What are you if you can't learn how to change font sizes in Office...?  Housebroken monkeys could learn that, I think.  Perhaps "furniture" is a good word for someone who can't be bothered to learn an interface that was specifically dumbed-down for people of his level of intelligence.
<P>
Perhaps I'm a little harsh on my brother.
<P>
Oh, and Tk seems to work...!  I ran some other thing it came with, just to see what would happen, and it *ran*, but still returned an error on (I think) line 350 of Tk.pm or somesuch.  Not something I was really worried about last night at 1:20 or whenever I noticed it.
<P>
I'm ill, somehow and with something.  I don't know what yet, but I know that last night I took a slug of NyQuil and today I downed some DayQuil, and I'm *still* not quite up to speed.  If it can defy DayQuil, it's *strong* bad mojo.</p>
