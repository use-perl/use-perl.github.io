<p>The <A HREF="http://www.majcher.com/nytview.html">NY Times subscription spoofer</A> has been rendered semi-useless (I couldn't get it work with prodding, and I suspect a large section of people are unwilling to go through the work of prodding).  However, it occurs to me that someone could probably just build a NY Times <EM>story</EM> generator and produce results that are just as accurate and well-researched as the stories that have been running there the past few years.

<h2>why do you need to spoof?</h2>

I've never understood the need for fake logins for sites like this. They're putting an awful lot of work and money into their site and they're asking from you the bare minimum in exchange. It seems like an equitable trade to me. What do you find objectionable about it?

It's not so much that I feel the need to spoof -- I don't -- more that I found it interesting that a tool to provide false information to gain access to true information was actually providing false information to gain access to <em>false</em> information.

<p>Actually, asking the bare minimum would be to ask nothing at all.  A bit more than that would be to have us put up with ads being slung at us, as with most of the rest of the web sites.</p>
