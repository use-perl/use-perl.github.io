<p>A friend of mine at the campus gave me an old 540 meg HD they didn't need, along with an eight-port network hub.  I've managed to physically get the drive and network card installed and install RedHat 5.1 on drive, so now I just have to move it physically into the office and figure out how to get Linux to realize I have a network card.
<P>
I'm not entirely sure that I can do much of anything with it once it's done, but I'm sure I'll get some learning out of doing it, and it'll be neat to fiddle with Linux.  I miss typing system commands.  :)</p>

<h2>Upgrade RedHat</h2>

<p>I think it will be well worth your while to get the RedHat 7.2 $10 bundle from <a href="http://www.linuxcentral.com/" title="linuxcentral.com">Linux Central</a linuxcentral.com>.  You will probably be much more likely to have your card detected and just DWIM.</p>

It's even cheaper to get Linux at <a href="http://www.cheapbytes.com/" title="cheapbytes.com">cheapbytes</a cheapbytes.com>.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Well, I hope that's the case; I'm fairly sure I picked the right driver out of the list, which worries me (in the sense that I'm terribly new to installing my own hardware and think I might have destroyed a vital component during the upgrade).
<p>
Also, I'd have to find some evidence that 7.2 will do okay with 10 megs of RAM.  In theory, I could get that up to 16 or possibly 32, but I don't know how easy that will be.</p>

<p>I managed to wipe the EEPROMs on my two network cards.  Always heed the warning that says, "Do not choose this option without reading the source code and configuring for your situation."  Sigh.</p>

<p>I'm guessing a text-only 7.2 should do fine with that much RAM.</p>
