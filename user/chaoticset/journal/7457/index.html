<p>Ugh, ugh, ugh.  I'm torn between being angry for not noting my loss of productive coding time and being accepting of the fact that -- sometimes -- I'm not always going to be doing things worth noting here.
<P>
I'm going for the second, I guess.
<P>
I have signed up for one class this fall -- a database class, 350 -- and my internship, which counts for credit but starts whenever the folks at the school get around to approving it.  Sigh.  I get fingerprinted next Saturday and after that I can start working any old time.
<P>
Of course, I'll be keeping notes about my internship (and, hopefully, any Perl-based solutions I should devise/locate) and my class here, but they'll be rather sparse, I expect.  I'll be attending class, going to my 30+ hours job, etc., and very likely won't have any time to devote to personal projects...except for, well, some too personal to name.
<P>
Regardless, I'm not down and out -- I'm just warming the bench for a while.  I have to remember that, or it'll be way too easy to ignore personal projects come next spring and just waste a lot of time playing GTA3.
<P>
Which, by the way, I have played for a couple of days now, despite significant slowdown, and I must say it's pretty damn hard in places, but well worth the challenge.  It makes you feel weird internally, because you'll realize the game actually <EM>rewards</EM> ruthless and amoral behavior as well as more standard game behaviors (for instance, you can carjack a taxi and play taxi for a while, picking up passengers and getting them to their destination for a chunk of cash, or play ambulance driver in a similar way).  You realize that -- in this game -- running over a paramedic and being a paramedic are both things that result in positive reinforcement.  It's really, really weird, and if I didn't know better, I'd say that the whole game is an attempt to comment upon society's bizarre fixation with horrible things, where serial killers become media stars and vigilante cops are lauded for their efforts.
<P>
However, since I know better, I'll just say that the game makes me think, and maybe thinking is good -- and leave it at that.</p>
