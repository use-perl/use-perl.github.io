<p>It honestly did not occur to me to ask the guy who first evangelized Slackware to provide me with a copy.  Yes, I'm not always that bright.
<p>
On the other hand, I told him I was going to try to get a copy, and it never occurred to him to burn me a copy, either, so...I don't feel <em>that</em> bad.
<p>
I've been footling around with <a href="http://www.orkut.com/">Orkut</a> so much the past couple days that I'm slacking off on writing code, which I need to be doing now that my work schedule has provided me a few hours of morning time where the SO is at work, my parents all don't know I'm home (I've effectively got 4 parents total, 8 if you count the SO's as well), etc.  Quiet time.
<p>
And <em>I</em> keep trying to spend it socializing.  :\</p>

<h2>Orkutting?</h2>

<p>
I have been to the Orkut site but of course I can't get in. What is the attraction? Is it the features of the site? The other members? The fact that it is exclusive (at least somewhat)?</p>
<p>
I know you are on at least one other site where you can socialize even if the male/female ratio is a bit lopsided. And there are many places on the net to socialize that don't require an invitation.</p>
<p>
This is not a knock on Orkut. It is just my curiosity meowing.</p>

I think the exclusivity preserves a certain semblance of order.  There are a few trolls here and there, but in general, if you don't behave, you don't get invited in the first place.
<p>
I don't know how I feel about that -- kind of like I've been brought into a country club, as if it's elitist -- but on the other hand, I generally think I'm an elitist anyway...and I don't know many people I haven't invited to Orkut at this point, informally or otherwise, so I don't really feel like I'm excluding anybody specifically.
</p><p>
There's some neat stuff at Orkut, that's all.  Let me know if you want an invite.</p>

Frankly, I don't know wether I want an invite or not, although I do thank you for the opportunity. I spend most of my 'web time' either here or at PerlMonks. On the other hand it might be nice to talk about something other than Perl once in a while(did I say that?).</p>
<p>
Yes, please arrange the invitation. If nothing else I would like to see what they say about themselves. Do you need anything from me? Once again, I appreciate the offer.</p>

Just an email address to send the invite to.  If you send a quick message to rover at sdf dot lonestar period org the invite will probably arrive within an hour or so.
