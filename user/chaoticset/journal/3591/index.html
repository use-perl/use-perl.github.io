<p>Here, here, don't beat on me any more!  I give up, I give up...I can <EM>no longer keep up with all the journal entries just by watching the Top 10 like a hawk</EM>.  Either my life has become too busy or else there's just way too much volume now.
<P>
Now, I have to go look at my settings and see if I can get a notification for <EM>every</EM> journal entry that's posted, or if I have to make everybody my friend for that.  (I like friends.  That wouldn't be so terrible, I guess.)
<P>
I broke down and ordered the Wolf Book at Borders.  (I realize that Bookpool has lower prices, but I'm a damn fool with no credit cards or checking account.  Besides, I feel guilty about always going there and reading their comic books.)  Hopefully this will help me advance my Perl-fu to the next level.</p>

I'm too lazy to learn SOAP, so I wrote a simple screen scraper that gets "http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=top" and looks at the by-date stuff, and notices whether there's anything new since the last time it ran.
<p>I should probably do it up in SOAP tho, since then it won't be fragile HTML-scraping.
</p><p>Aren't there already CPAN modules for talking to use.perl.org?</p>

That gets the journal entries, but it doesn't find the replies.  Especially on Monday, you can get replies to an entry that was made a few days ago, long after you read the original entry itself.

<p>It'd be cool to have a way to "tag" an interesting journal entry (or articles in general) and receive messages whenever a comment is posted.  Already, journal writers get a message for any comment posted, even replies to comments from other people.  I think.</p>

<p>So, the question is, does "tagging" scale?  Obviously, on slashdot, it could shut the whole world down if you allowed it on any article in general; hmmm... given that most articles would be tagged toward the end of the initial furor, that might not be too bad.  Very few comments are posted 24-48 hours after the article runs -- but if they are, some people would like to be notified.</p>

<p>But for journals this seems like a neat idea.  For here, at least.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, pudge, I'll quit having ideas!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

For the parent of the article to which I reply: the module in question is WWW::UsePerl::Journal.<br> <br>I'm slowly getting around to making some modifications so that it gets replies as well as the articles.<br> <br>The problem of making an emailer of journals is the replies - as jmm points out, they don't spring into life with the post to the journal, they accrete.<br> <br>So my journal mailer (available <a href="http://eh.org/user/koschei/code/perl" title="eh.org">online</a eh.org>) uses a modified version of WWW::UsePerl::Journal where the recentarray function returns the list of articles on page 2 of all recent posts rather than page 1.<br> <br>Means I'm a few days behind, but it seems to work.
