<p>In order...
<P>
<H2>Linux</H2>
<P>
Lovely, lovely, lovely.  Feels so nice against my brain.  I explained the whole thing out to my father, and he said two fairly astute things:  "Wow..."  when I explained that it's free, and "So the graphical Windows thing is just kind of watered-down stuff anyway?"  He knows how to turn a computer on and play F-15 Strike Eagle on it, so I felt I'd explained things properly at that point.
<P>
<H2>Perl</H2>
<P>
My attention span has gone to hell; sometimes I find myself looking at the cursor, trying to figure out what I was just *trying* to do.  In today's case, I figured the essentials of Vim out, and I'm fairly happy with it.  Attempted to write a filter today, but haven't tested it yet.
<P>
<H2>Zip Drives</H2>
<P>
Rooting around on the web has produced good news.  I want to use my parallel port Zip drive on the 486, and it appears that's entirely possible.  (Hell, some ambitious types figured out ways to boot directly from a Linux installed entirely on a single Zip disk from an IDE Zip drive.  Doesn't help me, but it's nice to know it can be done.)  If I can get the Zip working with it, I'll multiply my storage capacity by a factor of 3 or so.  That would be handy if I decide to use this thing as a DNS server in the future or keep it around for minimalist web browsing or something.
<P>
<H2>Tortellini</H2>
<P>
My SOTF showed me something about three months into living together that I'd never known:  If you *boil chicken stock*, you can *cook noodles in it*, and it's essentially *soup*.  (I hear you.  "Duh."  Well, sue me, I miss the obvious sometimes.)  Anyway, I picked up a couple bags of frozen tortellini specifically for use with Better Than Boullion(sp?), a marvelous little product.  Not any safer for the animals, if that's one's concern -- but that is only marginally my concern.  It makes delicious broth.</p>
