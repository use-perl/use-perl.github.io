<p>That's <a href="http://www.inpace.com/vik.html">Virtually Indestructible Keyboard</a>, if you're curious.
<p>
This model and another model they have -- the <a href="http://www.inpace.com/flexi3.html">Flexi</a>, which can actually roll up -- look as close as I'm going to get to a full-size keyboard that can actually sit on my lap and not be a complete encumbrance when I'm walking around.
<p>
I'm hoping to attempt to build a complete <a href='http://about.eyetap.org/tech/howto.shtml'>wearable computer</a> interface -- eyepiece and full-size keyboard included -- during this year.  This would be one of the first components that I've found that, almost off-the-shelf, will be what I need.
<p>
I'm actually hoping I can figure out a way to cut one in half, rewire it, and then keep each half on each half of my lap.  (This would also facilitate keyboarding properly standing straight up, I think.)  If it can't be split, then it'll have to pivot -- like, attach to a belt and roll up when not in use, that kind of thing.
<p>
Even barring all the wonky stuff I want to do with it, it just looks so damn cool anyway...!</p>

<h2>Flexi</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2004-02-10T22:25:29</h3>
I saw a guy using a Flexi in Kuwait.  His laptop was almost totally trashed---the hinges on the disply were broken so he leaned it against the wall at the back of the cubicle.  Other bits and pieces had fallen off or were cracked, and his laptop keyboard reminded me of Arnold at the end of Terminator---one eye human-like and the other the red dot of machine fury.<br> <br>However, wearable computing is not my thing.  The whole idea of computers is to liberate us from the workplace so we do not have to wear anything (if we do not want to).  In reality, without pants, or a thick magazine, my PowerBook burns my thighs, and not in a good way.

How'd the Flexi work?  I mean, I'll probably not get the chance to see one in action.  Did that guy seem to have a lot of problems with it, broken wires after rolling it up, etc.?
<p><blockquote><div>However, wearable computing is not my thing. The whole idea of computers is to liberate us from the workplace so we do not have to wear anything (if we do not want to).</div></blockquote>
See, but that's the thing -- some folks want and attempt to ensure a distinct separation between 'computer time' and 'non-computer time', and some cannot imagine why anybody would want the separation.
<p>
I fall into the latter, and some fall into the former, and it seems you do.  I don't really think either one is better or worse -- but all the same, I can't help but be tickled about the idea of having a wearable computer, to the point that I want to build one myself.  Oh, it'll be ugly, and bulky, but it'll entertain me.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

He said he loved it.  He crumpled it up in ball, wrung it out like laundry, and then rolled it up and put it in his bag.  It does need a firm surface to support it, unless you like a really mushy keyboard.

I'll have to bulk up, then.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D
<p>
Actually, I was thinking about putting smallish foam pads (perhaps cut from mousing surfaces) to provide minimum support.  I can experiment with that once I've got one in my hands, cut in pieces...</p>

<h2>VIK uses</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jbodoni/">jbodoni</a> on 2004-02-11T05:25:48</h3>
At $work, we gave up on replacing keyboards every two months on the computers in the extrusion department and replaced them with VIKs.<p>
The machine operators can toss the VIKs out of the way (sometimes as far as the floor!), spill as much coffee / soda<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/whatever as they want on them, and generally abuse the hell out of them.</p><p>
And I can still touch-type on them.  Simply a marvelous product!</p><p>

Sounds perfect for a home keyboard, honestly.  It's not so much the abuse -- I'm actually fairly careful with the keyboard myself -- it's the cat fur, and dust.
<p>
I found a place selling refurbs, so I may end up getting a few from there and whacking away at them.  I didn't realize the pound was doing so well until I converted the cost.</p>
