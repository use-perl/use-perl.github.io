<p>Well, after a bunch of DayQuil, three of those AMP drinks, and a bit of reading, my mind has finally started to work again.
<P>
Mostly.
<P>
I had a good idea (I think) while I was trying to read _Scene And Structure_.  (I fancy myself a gonna-be writer.  My attempts, fits, and starts don't belong here, but over the years I've probably produced a lot more writing than I should have.)  It occurred to me that I still needed to set up some sort of framework to do my personality exams in (I tend to do exams as my characters, hoping to gain further insight as to their behaviors in any given situation).
<P>
It also occurred to me that, since I started doing that several years ago, I've learned how to use a programming language that specializes in extraction and reporting.  *half-grin*
<P>
So I sat back and jotted down a few data structures, and it occurred to me that something like this might actually make a handy module for someone else.  It *also* occurred to me that a module might exist on CPAN that I could twist to my nefarious needs.
<P>
I'm going on a search for some sort of extensible, modifiable testing system.  If I don't find one...I may well attempt to write one.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Quick Addendum:  Bad enough that my eyes decieve me normally, and my memory the same; worse yet that it happens with such realism during this chemical-enhanced, illness-detracted stupor.  I saw a mouse run into the bathroom; I know for a fact that we don't have mice, and yet I spent the entire time in the bathroom paranoid that it would come forth and bite me.
<P>
I need to sleep, I think.
