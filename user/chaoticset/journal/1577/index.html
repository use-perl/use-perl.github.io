<p>I decided I should keep a journal of the stuff I'm doing on the 486, so I wrote a tiny little script to handle the journal entries for me.  Due to a sudden fit of nostalgic reading and a deranged mind, I decided to format it like an old-time Shadowland* document, like this(pretend the parenthesis are appropriate angle brackets):
<P>
((Date, Day, Time))<BR>
<BR>
)))))[The body of the entry is here.](((((<BR>
<BR>
<P>
This took a little bit of work, because just writing it directly to the linuxjournal file didn't make it come out right.  Eventually I got to the point where I built an array out of all the lines to go into the journal, then iterated over that array while each last line was in a buffer variable.  If the buffer was the )))))[ starter, then no linebreak was printed after it.  If the current line was FINAL (my signal to the script that I'm done with entering the entry), then it adds a ]((((( without putting a linebreak after the last line.  Otherwise, it just prints the line with a linebreak, just like I stored it in the array.
<P>
It took me maybe thirty minutes to work all the little kinks out.  (If I ever get ambitious I'll try to make it word wrap properly.)
<P>
Oh, and in school news, I'm 100% boned.  :(  Sitting in stats class this morning, I discovered that *everyone else has already turned in their project*!  I haven't even *STARTED* my project...!
<P>
I'll have to put something together and send it to him late.  It was apparently due five days ago.  :(  It's also apparently 10% of the grade.  Not a huge problem, but I could use it.
<P>
I haven't set up my English report, either.  I have the basic outline -- that was fairly easy, because the fact Zen Buddhism went here and there is well documented -- but details are lacking.  This indicates more research is necessary, which it is.
<P>
I have to go see my parents.  My brother offered me US$50.00 to clean his car out (something I did for a living about four years ago).  I was initially insulted, but it has occurred to me that there's little reason to be.  (Well, except for the fact that 50 is probably twice as much as a non-professional detailer would get.)  It's work, it's not like he's asking me to go back to the job, and it would be a nice change of pace.  Might even get me used to cleaning cars again so that I'll actually clean *my* car.
<P>
All that...plus I could use US$50.00 pretty badly.  It's nearly Cashmas, after all, and I've got to buy presents for some people.
<P>
Oh, and I'm sorry these are so friggin' long.  I guess I have a lot of muddle going on these days.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
*Most likely nobody here even cares, but Shadowland was supposed to be a pirate BBS used by criminals and sort-of-criminals in the game Shadowrun, and many of the supplement books would be formatted as documents from Shadowland. (I only know because I own 95% of the SR2 product line.) Blame Nigel D. Findley.  :)
