<p>I'm doing the second-to-last bit of my Cashmas shopping today, Somebody help me.
<P>
This is not made better by the fact that roughly half of it is going to be mailed.  If I owned a plane, I'd fly it there:  I AM SO SICK OF MAILING THINGS!  Holy moly.  Every time I look at a UPS truck, I contemplate suicide; mail this, mail that, recieve this, go to FedEx's stupid customer area for that.
<P>
I never wanted a job as a delivery man; why have I let myself fall into one?
<P>
Bitterness over, now a little plug for Taco Bell:  I ended up with a Grilled Stuft(sic) Burrito last night, and I must say I was pretty happy.  TB at its best (which is admittedly mediocre, but at least it isn't another effin' burger.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Effin'!  Whoa.  Where did that come from?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
In other news...perl.  This weekend I'm going to work on the script if nothing else goes wrong, and nothing had better go wrong or I will go utterly ape shit.
<P>
I already have some Dew (sampled yesterday to ensure its good quality) and my enormous drum of Maxwell House Master Blend is 1/3 full still, so I'm well armed for the weekend.
<P>
I wonder how a FPS where you run through a mall and kill people while you shop would sell for the 2002 holiday season?  *evil grin*
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Quick Addendum:  Okay.  Everything except my Californian friend's present has hit the UPS line, and I'm considering sending it USPS instead (since it'll take too long anyway, and seein' as how I'm almost completely out of money now.)
<P>
Anyway, I have to go figure out what the USPS can do for me.  (See, there's an organization I have had good experiences with.  The USPS has normally been a good standard method of mail delivery for me.)
