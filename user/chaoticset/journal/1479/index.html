<p>Now, if you change 'Linux' to 'love', it sounds like a country-and-western song, doesn't it?  *drawly background guitar*  "I laaaawwwst tha furrrst raaaaaaauwnd teeew love..."
<P>
Well, I tried, but I just couldn't fathom what I'd have to do without setting up a new partition on this machine's hard drive.
<P>
"But, chaoticset," I hear you say.  "You can do ANYTHING with this machine!  It's going back!  The hard drive will be wiped clean anyway!"
<P>
Ah, that is *true*...but, there is another problem.
<P>
For some time now, scandisk wouldn't finish on this thing.  I think I've narrowed the problem down in a sense; I know where it burps, near the 80% mark.  Then it decides that life isn't worth it, it's too hard...it *can't* go on.
<P>
Regardless, I can't defrag the drive because I can't fix the drive.  Whatever's wrong with it, my limited MS tools won't do the job.  (I'm not entirely sure *I* could do the job with any tools.)  I'm going to call and see if I can't get the drive fixed at the same time.
<P>
Long story short:  I can't make a decent partition on this drive, I can't figure out how to make the CD act like a partition, and I'm kind of fuzzy on the whole thing.
<P>
It is only the *first* round, though.  I will prevail eventually.  :)
<P>
One of my (damn few these days) friends suggests that I should take the Linux problems as a sign.  "Go OUTSIDE," she says.  Crazy.
<P>
I'll probably do just that, though, and try to stay minimal with my journal entries due to their low perl content if I put them in.  (I did say this was also going to be about school, so you've been warned.)
<P>
Speaking of school...I didn't have my persuasion paper done today, so that's what I'm doing tomorrow before my networking class.  (That and studying...my finals are coming up, and I've consistently scored very low in that class.  The final needs to be 85 or above.)
<P>
A shortish semi-vacation, and then it's back to the grindstone.  I'm still under the possible delusion that I can give myself the present of the test version of this script, fully implemented and ready for debugging, before the 25th rolls around.
<P>
I'll probably end up re-reading _Learning Perl_ during the interim, just so I don't forget what perl is.  ;)</p>
