<p>Well, for three or four it felt like I was playing catch-up all the time.  Call about this, be home for that, go take an exam, go turn in another, get up in two hours for class, blah, blah, blah.
<P>
I wouldn't mind rushing around if it were more focused.  If I were rushing around for a series of reasons related to a larger goal, I wouldn't mind it so much.  These things seem so unrelated as to be laughable.
<P>
Worst of all, in the midst of the VD, here I am, giftless for the SOTF.  Bad bad bad.  I've promised her that next week, my vacation, is going to be Valentine's Week, and I'm pretty sure I'm in the shitcan if'n I don't deliver.
<P>
What's all this got to do with Perl?
<P>
Glad you asked.
<P>
Forgive me this:  Engrish.  Sometime between my hopeful bedtime and my actual bedtime, I play in an IRC channel with a bunch of collegiate lowlife types (hi, guys).  One night, I started talking like I was a poor translation of English from Japanese or Chinese, like instruction manuals for Nintendo games tended to be.  "Shooting will make very the happy!"
<P>
This, we called Engrish.
<P>
Now, it's occurred to me that word <EM>could</EM> be taken as an ethnic slur.  It isn't; it's the product of ignorance, not malice.  Still, I won't call it the Engrish generator.  It will be the <B>Poor Translation Converter</B>.
<P>
Once I do it.
<P>
I'm working some rules together.  First rule of PTC:  "If an even word is plural, singularize it, and add 'many' in front."  Once I get a few of these, I'll build the regexes to do it, and see what a few documents look like in PTCish.
<P>
I also need to check CPAN to see if something's there (probably is) for getting word info, like plurals and what-have-you.</p>

Damn, and here I thought I'd coined the term.  Clearly I'd forgotten hearing it somewhere else.
<p>
I'll have to scour it.  Perhaps I can make something truly entertaining.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I've never heard of that before.  What is it?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
</p><p>
Actually, I spent about an hour doing some analysis of the sentence-mangling over at engrish.  I should probably pick apart the AYB script and see if something else drops out.</p>
