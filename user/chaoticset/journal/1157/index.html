<p>At least, I'm told this is what passes for normal.  Walk around a mall with a friend, shoot things in the arcade, make fun of people with poor taste in clothes, listen to other people's screaming children, eat out, drive around, etc.
<P>
I'm so glad my relaxation is over so I can get back to my work.  :)
<P>
I probably won't do much tonight but I do want to *try* to do something.  That something, I have decided, is figure out how I'm going to make *identifiable* carts in the cart system.
<P>
I think I've figured a way out.  It's *stupid*, but it'll work.
<P>
If I create an index value somewhere (probably some tiny little file) and use that to keep track of the number of carts, it'll work.  I believe.
<P>
It's not great (I'm pretty sure this isn't how you're supposed to do it) and it's sure as hell not secure.  It will work, though.  I think.
<P>
It'd be nice if the rest of the script were working.  It isn't.
<P>
I'm going to give that a shot while I eat the rest of my fries from Denny's.  Maybe I'll have some kool-aid too.
<P>
After the half-bottle of wine, I don't want to think about alcohol.</p>
