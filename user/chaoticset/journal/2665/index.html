<p>My wretched printer pulled another sick day on me, so I couldn't print my homework out.  That's why I've got to go to school early this morning -- I saved four different "print at this stage" snapshots of what I was working on to print once I got to school.  Let's hope I wasn't addled last night at 1 in the morning when I did it.
<P>
And <EM>yes</EM>, I had better results doing my homework the day it was assigned or the day after.  I'll go right back to that plan.  :)
<P>
It'll leave me some time to fool with OO stuff.

Have to go to my brother's for a few hours today; he's got some sort of problem with his machine, and since I'm the closest thing to an actual technician he knows, he's decided I should take a gander at it.  There's probably nothing I can do, but I'll try anything once or twice.
<P>
Plus, he makes really good chili sometimes.  ;)  Good chili could lead me off a cliff.

I found one of the webcomic artists I admire on AIM and gave him the bare-bones introduction to Chat Protocol.

He says I type fast.  I had never thought about it -- I clock around 80 WPM, not that speedy but faster than hunt'n'peck.  I won't fill this space with needless fanboy-ing, I just wanted to point it out.  His strip is <A HREF="http://plufim.keenspace.com/">here</A>, if anybody's curious what I read in my spare time.</p>
