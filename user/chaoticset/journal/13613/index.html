<p>Wrote a letter frequency analyzer, because I wanted to.  (Actually, it's the first step in a not-altogether ambitious project to write something that attempts to solve simple shift ciphers automatically.)  Did a baseline frequency on a dictionary file and used Storable to keep those stats.  (I know, I need something better, but it was the biggest wad of English text I had available that I was reasonably sure wasn't riddled with errors or "stylistic" typos.  Any suggestions for a better text are appreciated.)
<P>
Started learning how to footle with CGI::Application and HTML::Template, and I'm pleasantly surprised.  One little hangup -- not being able to make clickable images -- is not such a big deal, and I suspect there's a way to do it that I haven't discovered yet.
<P>
No other news...</p>

If you need any texts of any size check out Project Gutenberg.

Any specific ones you'd recommend there?  I wouldn't be against using a group of texts -- the process takes about two minutes with a 1.3 meg text file, and I want this to be really good, so I'd be willing to stick a couple hours to it.  I'd like the stats to be <em>much</em> more precise than normal, so I'd be all for processing ten or twelve texts.  It's just that the ones I happen to have on my drive at home (forgive me) aren't <em>normal</em>.  Perl docs, while reasonably grammatic and spell-correct and all, aren't normal text.  Neither are Trek fanfic (yes, I have a few, yes, I've read a few, and no, I'm not ashamed).  Neither is _The Crying Of Lot 49_, unfortunately.

Funny you should ask. About a month ago on the Perl Quiz of the Week mailing list, one of the quizzes concerned repeated substrings. One of the folks used the following text (extracted from an email):<br>-----------------------<br>'The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman' by Laurence Sterne, which when downloaded weighs in at around 1 Mo (as compared with 27 Ko for Dan Schmidt's US constitution).<br>-----------------------<br> <br>The location of these (from another email):<br>http://www.dfan.org/constitution.txt<br>http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg<nobr>/<wbr></nobr> etext97/shndy10.txt<br> <br>Enjoy. However, for frequency analysis just about anything might work on Project Gutenberg. Well, maybe the chromosomes might not.

If you're intending to solve short newspaper ciphers, consider that they tend to be quotations. Doing a frequency analysis on a set of quotes files might not be a bad idea. Having a separate distribution for "First letter of first word in a sentence, by wordlength" might help gain a toehold.
