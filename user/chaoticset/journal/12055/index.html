<p>Yeah, I know.  Stuff like that doesn't help one's indigestion or one's credibility.
<P>
It is what I'm snarfing right now, while I consider what else I have to do for FIDO.  Right now I've got the Wordmap module working (in the sense that it does almost everything I expect it to).  Next up is something to keep track of "preferences" (which is to say, weights about how much the current user likes this word or that word) and the document analysis portion of the mess.  (That's going to be the truly tricky part, requiring some interesting strategy -- for most documents, taking it line by line is the best solution, but as documents get larger, that solution gets worse in a geometric fashion, due to all the cross-checking that has to be done (sucking words out = linear, linking words to other words = geometric, I think.)  A 4 megabyte document shouldn't make this thing break, but neither should it be handled by time-consuming full processing.  Benchmarking will show just how much it takes for this thing to start to choke, and once that's figured some sort of estimations could be made in the program as to how to handle the problem -- figure out how much of the file it can reasonably handle, then attempt to gather a sample of that size from the carcass of the main file.)
<P>
Tired.  Reabena got a job, which is good -- but she's getting paid an (effectively) obscene amount of money for it, which is good and bad.  I don't like being dependant on people (in theory or in practice) at all, and I have a sinking feeling I'm going to end up that way.  It's not sinking into concrete, though, because things are mutable -- I may just get one of the other jobs I'm currently attempting to get, I might win an inheritance, etc., who the hell knows.  Not I, so things are in flux, as usual.
<P>
Is this how every creature in the world gets by?  Saying to itself, at the end of each day, "Things could be better tomorrow.  Yes, let's wait until tomorrow and then pass judgment on whether it was worth it."
<P>
I guess there are worse ways to survive.</p>
