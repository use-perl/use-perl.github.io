<p>I should be a *lot* more frustrated about this, but I'm trying to ride the feel-good wave from still being in school.
<P>
Turns out the VA thinks it doesn't have any requests from me since *2000*.  This isn't as bad as it sounds -- I didn't take any classes the spring and summer semesters last year -- but it does mean that whatever benefits I get from last semester are going to be VERY long in coming.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Bloody wankers.  Wait, those aren't U.S. adjectives, are they?  Stupid jerk-offs.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Tomorrow I need to call the ever-so-helpful (no sarcasm, they normally are) VA liaison office first thing in the morning and get everything straightened out.
<P>
My classes look pretty good.  (I didn't get two math classes like I wanted, but it's not a big deal; I have a full plate.)  Something called Information Systems Hardware/Software, retaking Intro To Application Development, Discrete Math II (to which my advisor pointed out, "You don't *need* this,") and CIS 131, Web Somethingorother.
<P>
Right now, I think I have the best feeling I could have about the semester.  Not the overly optimistic ones I've had in the past, nor the dreary ones I've had on occasion.  I just don't feel worried about any of it in the slightest.  It's a faint, faint confidence, but it doesn't feel false.
<P>
I think it's a good sign.
<P>
My eye has finally convinced me to purchase some Visine, which seems to help but then the strange irritation returns.  I would think it was pinkeye except it's not irritated enough and it hasn't spread to my other eye (or to my SO's eyes).  Very minor discharge.  All of it goes away after a day of not rubbing it, though.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Yeah, I probably overstepped the boundaries of good taste with the discharge reference.  :\
