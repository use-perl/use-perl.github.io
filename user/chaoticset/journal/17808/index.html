<p>As I'm new at work, I've never had the misfortune of filling out one of the "timesheets" until a very short time ago.  Disastrous.  It's an Excel file that has a VERY PRECISE set of formulas, all the dates must be entered manually, etc.
<p>
Time to learn how to use the Excel::* modules, I believe.
<p>
I'm fiddling around with AI::Expertsystem::Simple, partly because I think I'll do better having a little experience with XML now, and partly because I have need of something that can parse rules.
<p>
I haven't quite reached the point where I'm interested enough to learn the API for the Timex dev kit, nor am I hampered by the software provided to the point that I feel I need to break free.  I consider it a testament to the software's design that I haven't broken it significantly or found a huge, irritating limitation.  I never seem to run out of good stuff to say about the watch, by gum.
<p>
I'm still hoping that I can learn enough about the API to make the watch usable as a control device for my wearable computer (once <em>it's</em> built), but that's probably at least a few years off for now.</p>

<h2>Auto::Timesheet</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dws/">dws</a> on 2004-03-09T02:04:47</h3>
One of my first jobs out of school was for a large, now-defunct company that sold timesharing services. For arcane reasons having to do with some contract my division had nothing to do with, we had to fill out timesheets every week. One of my clever coworkers quickly whipped up the automatic timesheet generator, which asked the single question, "How many hours did you work this week?", then generated a timesheet with suitable random variations in how time was distributed. As far as I know, nobody ever either noticed or challenged the numbers.
