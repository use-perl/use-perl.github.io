<p>I found my TI just in time for my stats exam (I'm guessing I scored a B on it; everything looked right, but it always looks right on 2 hours of sleep to me) and got done with it just in time to get home and retype my English paper (wondering if I needed to do a retype of my *other* English paper, knowing I don't have my research done for my BIG English paper) and then I come home and I'll be just in time to clean up the house and go to my parents for dinner and then I'll be done that just in time to SLEEP.
<P>
I hate looking forward to sleep, but I am.
<P>
I'm going to miss this machine...I have everything set up exactly the way I want it.  The school computers are set up with a deranged security system where if you have to install things they vanish after the reboot; if you have to reboot to make it work, tough beans!  I hope it comes back okay.  I hope I don't have to do complete recoveries on it.
<P>
(But at least it's not like last time.  Last time I invoked a warranty, it was on a hard drive that had three months worth of novel -- some thirty pages or so -- on it.  I lost the whole damn thing and haven't started it over.)
<P>
At least I'll be able to play with Perl, my new favorite toy.  :)
<P>
(Heh, a toy Swiss Army chainsaw.  "When is a croquet mallet like a billy club?  I'll tell you:  Whenever you want it to be.")</p>
