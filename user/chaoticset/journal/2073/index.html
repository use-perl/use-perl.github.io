<p>Fool that I am, I emailed my advisor (late Wednesday) and gave him my notions for classes, asked him when I should come in.  He wrote back Thursday morning at 8:40 in the morning and said before noon, that day.  I didn't check my email until 3 or 4 in the evening.
<P>
Crap.
<P>
He said come in Monday.  Classes start Tuesday or somesuch, and I'm ready to start.  I think I can do better than this last semester; I don't see a replay of previous semesters as even a possibility.
<P>
It's slow, but I *am* improving at this school thing.
<P>
While I was at Borders, I read three-fourths of YASTCB*, this one going on about the differences between algebraic and geometric thinking, imagination's role in innovative thought, etc.
<P>
Those kinds of books tend to grab my attention, mainly because I'd like to produce more clever things before I die.  Right now, I'm so far behind in all the things I have to do that I will never catch up.
