<p>Man, ain't that the truth.
<P>
Today, I have a 7:00, a 10:00, and a 1:00 class.  Between the two last classes, I've got to return a box to a furniture store (futon, futon, futon) and after my last class I have to get my car fixed.
<P>
I know, you're wondering what the upshot of all that is to Perl.  I have an answer.
<P>
(leans in close)
<P>
It means I can't write any until at least 5.  And that pisses me off.
<P>
(leans back)
<P>
I found out you *can* push things onto an array, though I couldn't get it work properly.  All the warnings and errors in my current code (where I handle each card as an array element and then split it just before I print it) are gone except two, and they both state that I'm using uninitialized variables - but those three variables have been *declared with my statements*.
<P>
More research on my statements, and then check this push thing out again, and I should be back on track.
<P>
That's for fivish.
<P>
I wish I could do it now.  My Discrete Math class makes me want to die.  I took it last semester, and I'll never fail a class this boring again because I *might have to take it twice*.
<P>
Oh, and I've only had maybe 45 ounces of Dew, so I'm a little off kilter.  (I'm not good with ounces.  I've had roughly one liter.)  That's why none of this sounds like the rest of my journal.  (It doesn't, does it?)
<P>
<P></p>
