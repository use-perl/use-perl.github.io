<p>I've been playing Neverwinter Nights again (I never beat it in the first place, although I did manage to persevere all the way to the end of the first campaign part, the bit where you've gotten all the "pieces of the cure").  This time I decided to go a little more traditional than I normally do (usually I'll construct some hyperconvoluted three-class monstrosity) and make a fighter/sorcerer.  It's been going remarkably well, although I am feeling the pinch in a few places (my fighting is okay for random encounters and thugs, but bosses whup me hard).
<p>
I've been working on the CGI::Application for a site I've been noodling around in my head for a while, and (shamefully) have been setting up to use HTML::Template in it.  (I want to use something more fully engineered, but I'm not well-versed in Mason and TT...yet.)  The lie that I'm telling myself for now is that I'll shift into high gear after the prototype is complete and bust it into Mason or TT...and I'm hoping it's not a lie.</p>

HTML::Template is simple, fast, stable and well documented.  If its simple approach to templates works for your application, what is shameful about using it?<br> <br>-- Douglas Hunter

Amen!  And as I've said before, H::T is a wonderful way to constrain yourself from bleeding logic into the presentation layer, maintaining a strict sense of <a href="http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/smarch/st-docs/mvc.html" title="uiuc.edu">MVC</a uiuc.edu>.

Part of it is that I keep meaning to learn Mason and TT (at least a little, so I can intelligently decide between them when I need to) but I keep <em>reading</em> about them and not using them.  I worry I'm taking the easy route when I should be climbing a learning curve.
<p>
There's nothing wrong with me using it, per se.  I'm worried I'm using it to avoid learning other tools.</p>

Ahh, gotcha.  I can understand that.  I most commonly reach for Mason, possibly because I have used it the most.  It certainly takes some discipline to maintain a clear separation between layers when you have the templating system constantly tempting you to put application logic inside the templates, but it's possible to do {grin}.<br/><br/>-- Douglas Hunter
