<p>I rooted through the CPAN for no less than five whole minutes before I found the module that makes mine unnecessary.  Yay me.
<P>
It does indeed appear to have a much better implementation (I haven't installed it or anything -- I didn't have dire need of logging, just figured it would be a useful thing to code for myself) so I'll probably get around to learning it some day.
<P>
Right now, I've been madly scrambling to look at things I really, really don't want to look at most of the time (VB and cross-platform networking with Macs) to prepare for my internship.  I have two professor meetings scheduled this coming week, will probably end up meeting with the person who would effectively be my boss for some sort of pre-job rap session, and I get fingerprinted at the end of the week as well.
<P>
My printed materials on networking are both a bit out of date and don't cover much by way of Mac issues, so I'll have to go scroungin' on the net and see what I can dig up.  My copy of the VB Working Model is unfindable, too, so I'll have to skate off to school sometime this coming week to fiddle with a little syntax there, so I'm not completely ig-nunt when I get to the actual job.  Oh, and lucky me, I know someone with both a network-ready PC and a network-ready Mac laptop of some form (I really do know that little about Macs in particular, unfortunately, due to shortsightedness) so if I really, really hate myself, I can attempt to network them at that person's home.  Chao help me, I think I'll give it a shot.
<P>
I've been re-reading the intro chapters in _Programming Jabber_ in my spare time (*insert manic laughter here*) and it seems to make more sense now, probably because I can read OO Perl a little better now than before.  Interesting, and hopefully I'll be able to wrap my head around it in the near(?) future.
<P>
Re-read the Reefknot whitepaper.  Must read the RFCs mentioned, see if I understand them.  If I don't, I must get to the point that I do.  Also, need to read more from the Ruby website, the online _On Lisp_, and I need to visit Perlmonks more.
