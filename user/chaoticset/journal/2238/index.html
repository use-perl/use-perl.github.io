<p>The first third of the money for the water bill problem is due today.  I still say I'm not 50% responsible (I mentioned the toilet problem to him months before that, but I couldn't pin down the leak until December and I didn't want his jackass plumber in my home during the holiday season), but it's kind of irrelevant; legal fees would cost a lot more than half this water bill.
<P>
Still, it's a good reason to sell my Sony PlayStation and the games for it.  I figure with a turbofire controller and probably around 10 games, I can score at least US$80 for it.  That would help a lot for keeping gas (er, petrol) in the car.
<P>
I gotta say -- I've got a really, really good feeling about this semester.  (Even though I'm in a web design class the textbooks of which don't even <EM>mention</EM> perl.)  I just think I finally got the hang of it.
<P>
Speaking of things and hangs of them, I need to play with my Dutch translator some more.  (Actually, it's just an interface for sending a list of Dutch words to a translator page that only deals with one word at a time.  It just strips the translated words out, returns them in a file, calls it a translation.  As if.)
<P>
Oh, and the VA!  Turns out my apps got sent with the wrong claim number.  (Insert appropriate symbol-based cartoon foul language here.)  The helpful VA person at the parent campus oblingingly dealt with both this semester and last semester.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>Good news:  I'll be getting all my benefits for the last two semesters.
<LI>Bad news:  I'll be getting them in eight to twelve weeks.

This means that, yes, once again I'll be providing nothing.  :\  I realize this seems lazy -- hell, perhaps it actually is.  However, I view my academic situation as too dire to endanger at this point.</p>
