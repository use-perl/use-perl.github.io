<p>Okay -- who remembers the final episode of St. Elsewhere?
<P>
Well, I don't.  I just found out today that the last ep of that show apparently indicates that the whole series was the (day?)dream of a child.
<P>
Now, if you say something happened during a dream, that means it's not real, right...?
<P>
Okay -- then Oz, all the Law & Order series, Seinfeld, Picket Fences, etc., they all never happened.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.poobala.com/crossoverlistb.html#St. Elsewhere">Follow the logic here</A>, but it's fairly reasonable.  If character A showed up on Elsewhere, and (we'll say) showed up on Show B, then B never existed.  If B never existed, and character C on show B appears on another show, then <EM>that</EM> show never existed either, and vice versa -- if someone from Show Z appeared on Elsewhere, they never existed, so their show never existed, so...
<P>
Moral of the story:  Be careful who you do TV crossovers with -- you're crossing over with all <EM>their</EM> crossovers.  Practice safe role reprisal!</p>

<h3><a href="/user/jordan/">jordan</a> on 2003-09-10T18:27:45</h3>
The child who daydreamed St. Elsewhere could have been daydreaming about "real" people that he/she knew.  In fact, people usually <i>do</i> daydream about  real people.<br> <p>Therefore, the characters that crossed over could have been based on the real people the child knew or  had observed.</p>

Yeah, but the <em>specific crossovers</em>, at least, never happened.
<p>
If those crossovers never happened and aren't referenced in any way, shape, or form by the rest of the series in question, then it could be argued that somehow it was a daydream.  But a character from St. Elsewhere (assuming that it was really meant to be whole cloth fiction) showing up on another series pretty much means either that episode (and, usually, that means the series) is part of the dream or else it's not part of the series.
</p><p>
Of course, it's all just TV...but I've been curious what all these attempts to produce an internally consistent narrative across multiple shows would eventually result in.  This is reminiscent of quantum wave mechanics, in the sense that where (and what) you "measure" determines how much you know about the rest, etc.</p>
