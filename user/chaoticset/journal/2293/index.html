<p>Among other things.
<P>
I have a hundred neat things to check out and I can't think fast enough!  Trillian, CVS, PHP, and the whole rest of my list from my home node.
<P>
I ended up sleeping late.  I sleep so soundly that most alarm clocks can't wake me, so I trust my SOTF for wakey wakey.
<P>
Which means that if she wants the computer, I won't be woken up until at least 11:00 AM.
<P>
I have to call and try to get an appointment.  That's made easier by the fact that it's MLK day, so I don't have class.  (Which irritates the hell out of me.)
<P>
Now that I have some idea of what CVS does, I can't help but wish I could use it!  I need to reinstall that and see if I can get it operational.
<P>
Further, something's wrong with this system.  Adobe Acrobat won't last past a single run, now WinCVS won't last past a single run.  These are precisely the problems that are fueling the Shift OS Initiative at my home.  ;)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Quick Addendum:  Spoke too soon.  After some fiddling, I've discovered that (for reasons unbeknownst to me) it'll run any way <EM>except</EM> through the handy-dandy link it slapped into my start menu.  Normally I don't use those -- I make my own links in places I've already set up on my desktop for quick access -- but I was having trouble finding the WinCVS executable.  Found, noted, and linked.  I'm playing with it right now.

Trillian rocks - VERY useful for the Win platform so I don't have to run (N) IM's to accommodate for all my friends.  I just wish they'd hurry up the port to the Linux platform.
<p>
CVS is cool, though I gave up on it.  I had it installed, but couldn't get a system going like I wanted.  Too lazy, I guess.  (I have other folks [from the graphics department] and they're MacOS folks and not techies when it comes to things Web-related).
</p><p>
PHP is also very cool.  It's very easy to become a PHP coder instead of a Perl coder, though (if you're mostly Web dev), so watch out!  You may want to check out <a href="http://www.masonhq.com/" title="masonhq.com">HTML::Mason</a masonhq.com>, a mod_perl extension that allows you to embed Perl code in the HTML code.
