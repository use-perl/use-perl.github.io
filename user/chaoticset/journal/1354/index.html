<p>But I didn't click 'write in journal' to discuss my bills.
<P>
I came to talk about Perl and what I'm doing in it.
<P>
The secret project has back-burnered for now; I want, so badly, to get this friggin' site up and suddenly it has grabbed my attention with both hands and yanked.  I'm awake, ready, and I'm going to go in and code this thing.
<P>
My only problem:  Start on the security issue first, or start on the cart-view first?
<P>
That's easy...security first, pretty things later.  That way, when I'm getting tired and I'm tempted to go surfing, I'll watch the pretty things.
<P>
I have no junk food, save for some small Ghirardelli squares, but that's okay.  I have coffee, and with enough coffee, I can do anything.  :)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I forgot how good this programming stuff felt...I pretty much stopped my second year of HS, and didn't do any on my own time (except for that little stint with VB...but I was taking a class, please, don't judge me!) until September.
<P>
I missed this stuff.  I like it better in Perl.  I'm glad I found this language.  I owe my friend thanks.  :)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The session ID will involve the IP, the time and date, and a random number.  (As far as I can tell, that's not heavy-duty secure - one random number isn't going to prevent duplicate file IDs - but I'll beef it up later.)
<P>
Maybe if I use *all* of that as the file name, but still check the date chunk and IP chunk, it'll be secure.  Need to research this.  (Someone on Perlmonks had a link to and article at O'Reilly, so I went there, and it was all about this security ID stuff, so I printed part and read part.  I should finish it.)</p>
