<p>Which is to say I've decided to actually start doing things again.  I'm nearing the end of the Wolf book (finally, something with nuts-and-bolts cryptographic code so I can see how things work for myself!)
<P>
The temperature up here is unbearable, though.  It's 80 degrees due to the gas furnace repairman being a complete moron of some form; he told my landlord that "one zone should heat the house fine".  Note that the word 'evenly' did not factor into that description.  I'm sure that if it were all a large enclosed space with no dividing walls and ceilings, it might heat evenly throughout; however, realistically, it's 80 degrees in here and 70 downstairs.
<P>
I can cope with 80 degrees, but my fiancee and her snake cannot cope with 80 degrees for too long a time.  This should all be rectified by Monday, but it's been a very bothersome week, so to speak.
<P>
None of which is an excuse for not having the order script done, but I'm hoping to work on it tomorrow.  Tomorrow is the one day this week that nobody has decided what to do with my whole day.  Anybody who calls me tomorrow and asks me to help them, drive out, or do something for them is going to be the proud owner of a bleeding eardrum after I get through with them.
<P>
Just kidding.  :)  (I'll track them down and remove their ears with potato peelers.)</p>
