<div class="span8">
<p>Concerning previous entry -- I'm aware that this is one of those ideas that <EM>sounds</EM> so good that it cannot possibly be so.  Either I'm missing something vital (like, say, that the complexity of such a monstrosity would prevent actual creation of nontrivial structures) or else this is one of those ideas that every computer science student gets eventually.
<P>
I'm aware it's probably a bad idea for some reason.  I just don't know what yet.
<P>
Anyway, I'm not here to talk about...me talking about things.  Every once in a while, a well-meaning voice in my mind says, "Y'know, you hear about Emacs now and again.  Why don't you go see if you can learn how to use that?  You like complex things."
<P>
That voice is never around when I discover, say, how many floppy disks Emacs would fit on, or how long it would take to download the source.  No, it's run far, far away, and in its place is another voice, one saying "PFE doesn't even take up a whole disk.  What the hell does this thing do?  Does it write code for you?  Perhaps it's a faithful brain copy of the author."
<P>
About then, I get distracted and go somewhere else, typically <A HREF="http://www.penny-arcade.com/">Penny Arcade</A> or perhaps <A HREF="http://btc.bolloxcomics.co.uk/">Bigger Than Cheeses</A>, and like any simple animal, I forget all about it until next time.</p>
