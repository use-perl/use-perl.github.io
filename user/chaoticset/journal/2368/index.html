<p>I have yet to see if the U.S. is really any worse than any other place, or if I'm just being oversensitive because I never used to hang around places where people regularly ripped on the U.S. so much.
<P>
Literally didn't get anything productive done today except remember fondly the story and engine of _Deus Ex_ by replaying about 1/3 of it, between cleaning, cooking, a little sweeping, etc.</p>

<p>you live in one of the few states who voted for Pat Buchanan so it wouldn't be terribly surprising that you don't come in contact with many people critical of the US.</p>

<p>I don't wave any nations flag to be honest as nationalism is too much like a religion...unquestioning and blind. I like the US but I'd like it more if it seemed like people were more interested in making the US part of the world instead of the world part of the US.</p>

I don't think either one of those cases is true.  I think Americans are primarily interested in not getting dragged into the rest of the world against their will.  And I can't see that there's anything wrong with that; it is kinda why the country was formed, and all that.

Don't forget our 1% Perot anomaly, either.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
