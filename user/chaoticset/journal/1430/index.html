<p>I've been skulking around in my first hard drive.
<P>
(Pervert.)
<P>
That is, the first actual, honest-to-God computer I ever owned (the 486 PS/1 that took me from 1993 to 1999(!)) is sitting in the other room, hard drive nearly empty, ready to have Linux installed.  I spent a few hours making sure I'd archived only the useful things.  (It's only a 120 meg HD, sure, but getting stuff off it is a bit of a pain.)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's so strange to be looking at things from three, four, five years ago and knowing that somehow a record was kept of almost everything I was doing then.  I spent most of HS half-awake, because when I got home, I sat in front of the computer and essentially didn't move.  It produced an odd focus in me; it's when I started to write.  Lots of early writing, lots of discussions on IRC that I logged, lots of old email, old friends, old SOs.<P>
It feels so strange to see an archive of your life -- even if it's just for a (3|4)-year time span.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Man, if I was so keen on just getting Cygwin working, imagine how giddy I'll be when I'm a real, actual Linux user!
<P>
I suspect I'm not smart enough yet to make the thing sing and dance even if I can get Linux installed properly on it, so I won't be web-capable through it.  (I hear you out there.  "Good thing, too.  Less of his buggered insanity.")  If I do figure out a way, I'll have to post a journal entry just to prove I did it.  :)
<P>
Most likely, I'll just end up getting my hands in some more Perl, which is a good thing too.  I still have to do the backups on this system of all my new stuff (it's backed up on the drive, just not on CD where it should be) and set up the campaign for tomorrow night.  I'll probably do the campaign tomorrow and the backups Saturday.
<P>
A friend of mine is coming over to crash at my place a few nights, and we're settling in for MST3K and alcohol.  Nothing better than robots making fun of movies and drinking.  :)  Between all these things and the Xmas party I'm going to on Sunday night, I won't have time to perl before Monday when the machine gets shipped back.  (Hell, I'll barely have time to do my homework.)
<P>
I feel tired.  I only have to get the installation attempted a few times, and then I get to go to sleep!  Yay!
<P>
I hate looking forward to sleep.  I feel old.  :\
<P>
Oh, and I'm...uh, I guess the word is engaged, technically.  I'm *preparing for a handfasting*, and if you know what that is, you know why I didn't want to use the word 'engaged' as is.  The word 'marriage' seems to conjure a lot of legal stuff for most people, and I find the legal concept of marriage utterly abhorrent; it seems to imply a zero-trust relationship.  I had one of those with an employer, and it's not pleasant.  I'd rather not be legally required to be in love, thank you very much.
<P>
As an alternative, my SO has suggested handfasting.  My SO is an occasionally-practicing Wiccan (I believe this is appropriate terminology) and explained it to me in fair detail.  My own religious beliefs being what they are (don't ask), I had been searching for a ritual that could somehow fit within their framework, and this will do okay.
<P>
That is way the hell too much about my personal life.  Something about perl...
<P>
I'm probably going to turn into an actual Perl Monk tomorrow.  I find it a little anticlimactic since I'm going on a mini-hiatus for the next few weeks, but I'll take what I can get.  It'll be nice to really be a Monk.  :)
