<p>OW.
<P>
I haven't gotten a lick of work on the fuzzy module done, destroying my vision that it might be finished this week.  Ah well.  I know I can finish it -- I just can't seem to write anything that works, in terms of code.
<P>
Tomorrow I have the day off (due to some rather sudden changes at the phone farm I work at, about thirty people got the weekend off, me included, and all it took was completely changing the contract we worked on from one customer service contract to another customer service contract...) and I plan to use my spare minutes to cobble together the actual geometric solution to this whole mess, then slap together the algebraic solution, and then write the code directly from that.
<P>
All this farting around with triangles has made for real fun.  I miss doing proofs...!  Back when I took discrete math structures (&lt;shame&gt;the first time... &lt;/shame&gt;), my car was at an acquaintence's home getting the entire front end replaced along with the radiator and some other equipment, and I spent hours and hours a week on the public buses, going through pad after pad of paper working together proofs.  Usually I was pretty lucky if I could build a working proof at all, but if I did it right I could keep the conceptual model in my head long enough to try to write another proof of the same thing.
<P>
It was entertaining, and I got this weird little circuit going in my head where the proofs brought me some odd sort of satisfaction, the same sense I get when my code works or when I finish cooking.  I guess I could say that I find congruent conclusions pleasurable.
<P>
Anyway, I missed it, and started to get the same feeling working with the triangles and trying to calculate the area of this and the angle of that (when I didn't understand the bounded sum operation and was trying to fudge it the hard way).
<P>
It's not as though I didn't do anything, though.  Found some spiffy stuff -- notably Lingua::LinkParse (which is something I've been looking for, in the exact form it showed up, for several months now -- I just didn't realize that it was something anybody would have written already.)  Also <A HREF="http://freevo.sourceforge.org/">freeVo</A>, which purports to be exactly what it tries to sound like -- a free software package that, if it's connected to some media devices for input/output, can record instances of media.
<P>
Assuming everything works perfectly, there's no reason you couldn't pipe cable to a spare Linux box, freeVo just like you'd TiVo, and then switch to the output station and watch whatever you recorded.
<P>
This is quite a leap, though.  (The tricky bit with any 'free' version of something tends to be the initial set up, I've found.)  I doubt most people have the perfect setup, and I'm certainly not one of them, so I don't have a lot to say by way of reviewing just yet.
<P>
Slashdot posted a link to something called WASTE, and I followed it when I first saw it...and it worked then.  By the end of that same day, it was gone.
<P>
Such is the ephemeral nature of the net.
<P>
In the very thread underneath the newspost, I found three different mirrors of the software.
<P>
Such is the permanent nature of information.</p>
