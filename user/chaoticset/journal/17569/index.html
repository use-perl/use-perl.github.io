<p>Still having trouble getting Net::AIM working.  At this point I've stripped out niceties, compared to examples, etc., and can find no significant difference.
<p>
(I know, 'significant' in my mind is clearly not quite matching up with 'significant' in terms of actual characters in the code.)
<p>
I drag out the debugger section of the Camel and start sticking breakpoints, like voodoo pins, into some of the problem areas.  Stepping through the debugger...
<p>
...everything works.
<p>
I figure I've just missed that it works, and rerun it sans -d.  Still doesn't work.
<p>
Maybe I'm going insane.  I need more coffee.  Once that is fetched and I call my father, I'll slap my eyeballs against this thing again and see what falls out.</p>

Strangely, it turns out there's not really a bug per se, just unexpected behavior.  See next entry.

<h2>Async Call?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brianiac/">brianiac</a> on 2004-02-23T16:25:05</h3>
When this happened to me while working on a network-related task, I found that the time taken in stepping through the code was either allowing an unexpectedly ansyncronous call to complete, or allowing a remote resource to complete (unintentionally asyncronous).

<p>I've had this problem before.  In my case, I didn't appear to be iterating over a hash properly.  However, when I stuck in debugging code to dump the hash, it worked fine.  When I dropped to the debugger and manually inspected the hash, it still worked.  As it turns out, the problem was because I was calling <tt>each</tt> on the hash and dying if I had problems.  However, I was catching the <tt>die</tt> in an <tt>eval</tt> and reentered the subroutine with correct arguments (this was in a test, so you can see why).  When I reentered, <tt>each</tt> was not reset, thus causing the failure.</p>
