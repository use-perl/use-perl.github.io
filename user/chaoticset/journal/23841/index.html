<p>The results of the extensive testing I took a few weeks ago have been discussed with me; among other things, it looks like they're positive I have ADHD.
<p>
I picked up some books on the subject; unsurprisingly, I'm finding it hard to read them.</p>

<h2>ADHD-Like Symptoms Caused by a Food Allergy</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davebaker/">davebaker</a> on 2005-03-25T16:19:00</h3>
Hello!

<p>My son, who is now 10, has a food allergy that we didn't figure out until he was about two years old; if he has anything with corn or corn products in it (including the ubiquitous cheap All-American sweetener, corn syrup), he almost immediately exhibits ADHD-like symptoms -- hyperactivity, very low attention span, low frustration tolerance. It's amazing. My wife has learned how to cook without using corn products.

</p><p>NONE of the pediatric physicians were willing to entertain the idea that a food allergy could be responsible; we had to track it down on our own.

</p><p>We tracked it down by starting with a very bland diet (mostly rice products) and then adding different things to his diet.  Corn proved hard to pin down as the trouble-maker because it's in so many store-bought things.

</p><p>I know it sounds wierd, but maybe you want to check it out? Heck, you can't even have a Coke without getting a huge slug of corn syrup.

</p><p>Do your ears or does your nose ever get red?

</p><p>Best regards,

</p><p>Dave Baker</p>

<p>Definitely check out the allergy possibility.  It's amazing how many doctors still don't even seem to believe allergies exist.</p>

<p>My father's best friend is an allergist and has been treating us for years.  In that time I've had occasion to read a lot of pamphlets about the allergy  ADHD connection while waiting around in his office.</p>

As far as I know, my ears and nose do not get red.  Of course, most of the time I can't see them.  They don't generally get warm, like my skin gets when it's flushed, though.

<h2>Could be food</h2>

<p>While there are a few people with their brains wired somewhat different, there is good evidence to suggest that many people with ADHD are merely responding to poor diet. Highly processed foods are rich in fat, salts, sugars and addititives known to have side effects. Cut out the junk and processed food, and try a balanced diet. Even if it's not the cause of your problems it's worth avoiding junk food anyway...</p>
