<p>Note to self:  Do not EVER eat that much kielbasa again.  DEFINATELY not with hot dogs.  ABSOLUTELY NEVER when you go to an Octoberfest party after and have even MORE sausage.
<P>
Ugh, my stomach right now.
<P>
I am so tired.  All the non-sleep I've been getting has caught up with me.
<P>
And...yet another admission...I'm kind of afraid to start the CGI.
<P>
Maybe it's just because this will be code that produces such obvious, visually scrutable (is that a word?!) results...or perhaps it's because so many people build webpages, but so few build them well.
<P>
Maybe both.
<P>
Well, whatever it is, I have to get over it.  My project deadline is November 1st, and if it's possible I'd like to avoid delays.  (Of course, I've explained to the client that there's going to be a few rough weeks at first.  He's okay with that, he just wants presence ASAP.)
<P>
Speaking of which, I should mention that I spoke to the client recently.  (He's been in Massachusetts for a while, and won't be back until the coming Friday.)  The process of building the actual inventory file will probably begin the week after he gets back, so that if the CGI is all working by November, the inventory will be ready to be worked by then.
<P>
By the time he gets here, the inventory scripting may be easy enough that I'll just let him do it.
<P>
I think my memory is getting worse, and I'm feeling fairly ill.  I'm going to schedule a doctor's appointment when I get home from class Monday.</p>
