<p>I said I would put a bunch of tests in ulam.pl, and that was an utter fabrication.
<P>
A few months ago, a guy asked me to set up something he needed done for his site.  I told him I didn't know how to do it then, and he hasn't spoken to me since.  The specs for it rose again in my mind, and I realize that it really wasn't as hard as it sounded; I just wasn't as familiar with the CGI functions as I am now.
<P>
So I wrote the whole script, yesterday, and it does the absolute minimum of what he needed.
<P>
Seeing as how my landlord had a fit about the water bill (due to a leak behind the toilet, which I *still* contend was not entirely my fault because I remember telling him about it several times), I need any money I can locate.  To that end, I'm going to put my printed copy of _Cookbook_ and my spare copy of _Nutshell_ up on half.com or eBay, and see if I can't score some cash out of that.
<P>
I still have my _Bookshelf_ copy, so it's no skin off my nose; I've been meaning to sell them for a while now.
<P>
I emailed the guy, and told him that if he still wants the script, I have it done.
<P>
I really didn't want to get into selling a simple script, because it's such unfamiliar territory for me.  I don't know what to charge.  I don't know how this makes me look.  I have only the vaguest notion of what the perl community thinks of doing such a thing.
<P>
Regardless...I need the money.  If he says he'll pay for it, I won't argue with him.
<P>
I got to use Test::More with it, so at least I learned something along the way.</p>
