<p>LOTR LOTR LOTR LOTR.  There.  LOTR.  One more for good measure.  I don't even want to THINK about Fudoodle Schmuno the Burble Creature and his fifteen gazillion friends in Faux-Middle-Age-Earth again.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
That said, I'll probably end up seeing it due to the influences of the SOTF.  *shrug*  I've sat through movies I didn't care about before; I bring a book and a flashlight.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Anyway, I have <A HREF="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=108949&user=chaoticset">problems</A>, and I'm not sure they're getting better.  <A HREF="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=22609&lastnode_id=22609">tye</A>, bless him, tried to help me out; he showed me how to use map with center() to get a bunch of things centered.
<P>
Well, sort of.
<P>
I have to play around with this; I suspect I'm not parenthisizing properly, but I'm at a loss to explain precisely why, now, that there are three checkboxes, no text fields, etc., in each row.  Utterly bizarre doesn't cover it.
<P>
On the up side -- LOTR -- AAAAAAIGH! It's back!
<P>
Seriously.  I gotta say, I'm having roughly the reaction to J.R.R. Tolkien that I had to Massachusetts:  The more I hear about it, the less I like it.  My SOTF keeps telling me vaguely disturbing things, like "Pedestrians never have right of way."  Apparently, in Massachusetts, if you get hit by a car, it's your own damn fault.
<P>
I really, really tried to read _The Hobbit_.  I couldn't.  There was just no way I could stomach all that.  One of the obscure unnecessary descriptions of something or other made me snap, and I just quit, threw it down and never touched it again.
<P>
Yeah, I hear someone out there:  "Just try...read them again...read and become one of us...learn Elvish..."  No thanks.</p>

1. Pedestrians have the right of way, but only if they don't look directly at any of the cars, and give the cars plenty of lead time to slow down<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... a little.
<br>
<br>2. Don't read The Hobbit.  LotR is better.  The Hobbit is dull IMO.

There have been only two books in my rather extensive reading career that caused me such discomfort reading them:  _The Hobbit_ and _Alaska_.  (James Michener at his finest.  If you're fascinated by geological processes and the thoughts of random animals, please, give it a half year of your life.)
<p>
I've never read anything by J.A.M. again, and I suspect I'll never try J.R.R.T. again either.</p>

Don't feel too worried about JRRT.
<br>
<br>What he writes can be quite lovely, unfortunately he tends to give far too much detail and writes in a fairly curmudgeonly style. Some people like it, some people (like myself) don't.
<br>
<br>&lt;sarc&gt; <i>now if only someone had taught him how to write...</i>&lt;/sarc&gt;

<p>In Massachussets?! If they exist clearly they are just begging to be used as target practise for the SUV crowd. Hell, they don't even have sidewalks in much of suburbia. I'm scared to death in my Volvo wagon much less being on foot. Clearly they are just suicidal maniacs.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Tolkien is an aquired taste. Usually there's a line between those who like sci-fi and those who like fantasy...If you liked C.S. Lewis' Narnia then you could probably get into the LoTR...but avoid the Silmarillion and the Hobbit as a first wade into the story since both are long and obtuse if you aren't familiar.</p>
