<p>I did all my screamin' and shoutin' at home, then buzzed straight to the comp lab here at school to update my journal...concerning PERL stuff.  At my HOUSE.
<P>
Because I figured out what I was doing WRONG, and five boot disks (four MS-DOS, one LILO) plus a CD driver later, got LINUX WORKING ON MY 486!
<P>
One moment.
<P>
(pause)
<P>
There, I'm done dancing.  The rest of the people in the lab think I'm nuts, but they thought that already.  To hell with 'em.
<P>
I can't express just how good I feel to finally have gotten Linux working on that box.  It was my first real computer ever, and I'll miss it if it ever truly dies.  I lived on that thing for six years, and it's never failed me yet.
<P>
I really can't express it; it's good, good, good.  Good.
<P>
Oh, and I looked at the Warhol Worms link too.  I always found intrusive programming fascinating, partly because of their apparent simplicity (it always seemed to me that true evolution hadn't happened yet in virii) and partly because of their apparent success in infection.  Systems in action -- no matter their type -- are always fascinating.
<P>
Anyway...lordy it's good to be back at a desk...!  I set up the 486 on the floor, so I sit crosslegged in front of it, keyboard on my lap, and the monitor (a 640x480, max 256 colors!) sits on a cubical chest of my SO's.
<P>
Another shocker:  I sat down and started reading through Llama again...and so far (a couple of pages into Chapter 2) I *understand* everything.  Before, I would read, find a section I didn't understand, and commit that to my 'find a context for this' buffer until it overflowed and my headache came back.  I haven't gotten that yet.
<P>
I feel warm all over.  *enormous grin*
It's good to catch up on everyone else's journal, too.
<P>
In my spare moments (HA HA HA HA) I'm going to plow through Llama, typing actual examples.  Partly, I want to see what I understand...and partly, I want to convince myself that I really got Perl working.  :)
<P>
