<div class="span8">
<p>Feh upon myself:  In an attempt to demonstrate my Perl-fu (only to myself, mind you) I tried to write a simple screen scraper in just a few hours, as step one to something a bit more ambitious (something that would randomly rearrange panels of a webcomic I read and generate "new" comics from those panels).
<P>
Of course, I've only ever written one screen-scraper before, one for use.perl.  (Actually, it took a URL and a template ID and returned all instances of that ID on that URL.  Indicating no ID returned all instances.  It wasn't efficient, although it was a good way to start with LWP::Simple, IMHO.)
<P>
Tomorrow I'll toss another hour at it somewhere.  It's close to working -- most of what's working against me isn't ignorance so much as inconsistent coding on the part of the webcomic author.  (Part of the strip's run, they're in a subdir for images, part of it they're just in the main directory; part of the strip's run, wonky formatting prevailed, etc.)  It's stuff that I should learn to work around anyway, though.  It mirrors real-world conditions to a greater degree than I'd want to think, probably.  :(</p>
