<p>I came by the campus to check on the script issues and helped the same person find a squirrely little bit of the start_html syntax.  Felt a little better about taking the money.
<P>
Regardless of how I feel, it seems that there's another person they know who might need similar help.  It would pay more, but it's in a couple of weeks, so more on that as it develops.
<P>
The internship is looking more and more likely, which is a good thing; it's looking less and less Perl-related, which is an okay thing.  (I've been worried lately that I'm specializing too much by doing nothing but Perl all the time, and that maybe I should get out and see some other programming languages.  Python -- nobody hit me now -- but Python, from the little bits I've been seeing of it, has made me very curious.  So has Ruby, but as I'm less likely to find a used Ruby book I want than a Python book, I'll probably stick to Python.)  The internship looks like it'll be network-y, although I'll find out some specifics today around four.
<P>
I've been toying with writing the six-degrees thingie that finds links between pages.  The biggest problem is that I'm going to have to put a cap on it, since there's no guarantee it'll find a route and there's no way to tell that no route exists.  I haven't put together reliable estimates for a cap yet, but I'll probably use 100 while I'm just farting around with the code.
<P>
Once I get home, I'll just start coding, drinking coffee, and relax.</p>

<p>
You can find used copies of "Programming Ruby" on Half.com and Amazon for about $15.  I think you'll find Ruby a cleaner language in general, and it's certainly a greater departure from Perl than Python is.  When I learned Python it felt like it was only slightly different than Perl, and both the syntax and indentation rules annoyed me.</p>

Downloaded, along with the Win32 installer, thanks.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Oops.  I forgot to mention that.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(
<p>
One nit I have with the online version, and a minor warning for you chaoticset, is that it will sometimes refer to page numbers.  Unfortunately, there are no page numbers in the online version.
</p><p>
That nit has come up in the mailing list recently, so maybe someone will hyperlink those references to the proper place in the book soon.</p>
