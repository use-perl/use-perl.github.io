<p>I remember the first time I saw a stress inventory (those little questionnaires that have things like "Got a raise in the last three weeks.  Married in the last year." and a set of values for them).  "What do you mean, getting a raise is stressful?"  The book went on to explain that *any* change is stressful, no matter if it's positive or negative.  (Hence the reason that rock stars tend to self-destruct; they're under huge amounts of stress due to significant environmental change.)
<P>
And, now, I remember back to my doctor visit, what she said about the headaches.  "These would seem to be stress-related, but there's no sign of that."  She meant I seemed calm.  I was calm; I am calm.
<P>
But I am still apparently stressed, considering that I changed jobs so drastically.  I guess that's the headaches.
<P>
It may be time for a little R&R -- and on that note, I have to send the computer back on the 3rd.  Six days or so.
<P>
Still gotta fix the logos; I think if I make them high-res and then jpg them I should get decent resizing.  (OF course, I'm probably wrong; the amount of web design I've done in my life is less than 24 hours worth.  Maybe I should get that up to a few days worth.  ;)  )
<P>
Oh, and my SO came up with the obscene notion of a Computer Professionals Union.  ("Hey, the CPU says I don't have to do anything without a work order.")  Won't THAT be a fun thing...
<P>
Oh, and horrors!  I've lost my TI-86!  That wouldn't be so bad, but I had programmed *everything* I would need for my stats test into it.  The stats test is 10:00 tomorrow morning.  If I don't find that calculator, I'm screwed.  I don't have another one at all, certainly not a scientific one.  :\
<P>
Networking class tonight.  I get to find out what my partner for the project has done with our notes and my photos.  (Let's hope it's good.)  We had some communication problems due to where he's living and his unwillingness to use chat programs (and my inability to make long-distance calls).
<P>
Need to fix things, need to fix things.  Gotta brew some coffee, too.</p>
