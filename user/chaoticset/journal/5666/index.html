<p>I guess I've always been easily impressed.  I'm not "Oooh, shiny!" all the time or something, but all the same, I find myself smiling and grinning at things that other people find either mundane or hopelessly arcane.
<P>
Take DBD::CSV.  (Please.  *rim shot*)  It impresses me greatly that I'm going to be able to work out simple SQL on DBD::CSV, and then, essentially just by changing my use DBD::CSV; to use DBD::MySQL; , I'll be able to use roughly the same syntax with MySQL.
<P>
I realize that this is the goal of modular code -- to be able to use as much of one thing in another, and to provide standardized syntax as much as possible for things that should have standardized syntax.  I further realize that it didn't happen all by itself; it was the effort of other people that allows such neat, easy tricks.
<P>
I can't help it.  I think it's really, really slick.</p>

<h2>Other standalone DBD's</h2>

<p>There's also DBD::Sprite, descended from the Sprite module developed for the first edition of O'Reilly's CGI Programming on the World Wide Web.  Or to be really fun there's DBD::Excel.  Matt Sergeant was also working on writing a DBD for a standalone file-based database awhile back; it was in his journal.</p>

<p>That standalone DBD is DBD::SQLite -- very nice.</p>

It's been a dream of mine to get around to writing DBD::DBM. Utterly useless, but, you know,<br>for completeness' sake.
