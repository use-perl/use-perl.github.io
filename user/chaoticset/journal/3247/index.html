<p>Good:  A VA check came.<BR>
Bad:  It was only for one month worth of go-to-school.<BR>
Good:  I think that means that this semester is set up normally.<BR>
Bad:  I think it <EM>also</EM> means that they don't think I applied for last semester's benefits.<BR>
<P>
This does, however, mean we do not have to live in perpetual fear of the phone, power, or cable being disconnected (and Laura won't let me get the cable disconnected, either, claiming that _Farscape_ alone is worth money to her).  It also means that I can focus on something else, and perhaps even take my fiancee out sometime later this month.
<P>
I will be SO happy when I've finally embraced my evil nature and taken the world over.
<P>
Have decided today would be best for doing both the exams.  Pick up Laura at seven, pay the power bill, go pick up a package at my parents' house...the rest of the day is going to be a little busy.</p>

Kill two birds with one stone.  Replace cable tv with cable modem.  Install TV tuner in computer.  Split cable line to tuner, modem and any other TV's you can reach.
<p>
Voila!  You now have high-speed access *and* cable tv.  Plus, you can watch TV on your computer and surf during the commercials.  Or, you can record (.mp2 or<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.avi generally) straight from your computer to disk.
</p><p>
Oh - make sure your splitter(s) are rated high enough (I think 700 MHz).  I bought one at Radio Shack that was only 600 MHz or so and would cause sporadic outages from time to time.</p>
