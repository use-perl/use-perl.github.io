<p>Time, wrong, late, too, fuggle.
<P>
Didn't get the discrete math exam done.  Kept waiting for caffeine to kick in (because I felt so godawfully tired) and it only kicked in now, at 2 in the fucking AM.
<P>
Never again a 7 AM class.  Never again.  I don't care if it's a class on how to make crack out of Drano, I don't care if it's a class about the meaning of life.  I don't care if it's free money with sexual favors included.  I swear, Chao as my witness, that NOTHING short of nuclear armageddon or accidental personal organ failures will make me get up before 7 in the morning ever AGAIN.
<P>
I love the math.  I hate the time.</p>

"Never again a 7 AM class."
<p>I had an 8am Tuesday and Thursday statistics class my first quarter of grad school.  I think I probably went it at most five times, and maybe twice actually on time.  The memory of it fades, like some movie I only half-watched, but I swear that every day, I <em>meant</em> to go.  And yet, something about getting out the door by 7:40 in any kind of Chicago weather is just not such a great plan, next to sleeping in.
</p><p>Going the other way, I had a 7-10pm Thursday night class once.  Not so fun either.
</p><p>I'm too old and lazy now, and proud of it!!</p>

Serious consideration is being given to the don't-show-up plan for the now four-hours away class.
<p>
It's just that I've done so damn well so far, and in 280 with this guy last semester I scored a hard C...
</p><p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>...well, it'll only be the second class I've missed.  I think...crap.  Wish I could remember.</p>

I had a 7:30 a.m. Philosophy of Ethics class once.  The professor was very old -- and often quite wrong<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D -- and no one else in the class was awake enough to talk, let alone think, so it was often a dialogue between the two of us; and most students, who wanted to just sleep, ended up really regretting the whole thing.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br>

8:00 AM stats classes - that brings back memories.<br> <br>I got to mine about three times in the term - in each case I got to it because I was <i>still</i> up after an overnight programming session.  The prof didn't believe I was in the class when I went to the exam.

Sometimes when my sleep schedule has me up at a weird hour poking at something or other, I hear my neighbor leaving the house for work at like 5:30.  I have no idea what he does, but I doubt it's going to class.  Maybe he's a baker or something.
<p>So anyway, one part of my brain says "sit in class at 7:30?  HAH!  Try doing hard manual labor at 6AM!".  The other part of my brain says that the other half should shut up I can go back to sleep.</p>

Well, last semester the 280 class was at the same time and my stats class was immediately after.  Nothing says shock to the system like four straight hours of math, first thing, at 7 AM.

<h2>Consider avoiding the military</h2>

People often seem to think that in Basic Training that our troops get a shortage of sleep.  Except for day one (when you're simply too stressed to sleep anyway), that's not true.  We always got 8 hours.
<p>
However, Tech School (Keesler AFB) was another story.  Our classes started at 6am and went until noon.  Now if you figure in the fact that we had to get dressed, get breakfast, line up for formation and then *march* to school (about a mile), we were generally up by 4am (at the latest)!  Curfew was 10pm, but many went to be long before that.

Did I mention that it was uphill both ways?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>
