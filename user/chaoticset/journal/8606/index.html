<p>Outlook, in its infinite wisdom, produced a directory of files named the email they contained.
<P>
And Windows 2000, in <EM>its</EM> infinite wisdom, will not handle filenames longer than a certain length.
<P>
The upshot of this is that the script which should be able to burn through a whole directory of student emails and attempt to filter filth from them is stopped cold merely because one lone student decided to send an email named 'doooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood'.  Further, it fails silently (possibly because there's really such a low-level system issue with the filename being a couple hundred characters).  Even worse, it only gets through 91 messages out of 1600 or so.
<P>
Just have to zip over to the Cougar and see about that "check if the file's working, if not, skip and keep going" script.  I may have to write something that parses a Win2K dir output, too, because opendir fails silently and disgustingly at email 91.
<P>
This is all assuming there's no way to delete that file that Les can find without me.  There's got to be a way.  I mean, <EM>something</EM> has to be able to delete it...
<P>
...right?</p>

<h2>DOS file names</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2002-10-27T00:27:23</h3>
Your problem is getting rid of a file with a far too long name? Have you thought of using the 8.3 filename (AKA "DOS", or "short" file name) to identify the file? In case you didn't know: ActivePerl has some functions to convert the long file name to the short file name and vice versa, built in. See `perldoc win32`, under "Win32::GetLongPathName" and "Win32::GetShortPathName".
<p>Granted, I don't have W2k here, so I can't be 100% sure it actually works.</p>

A <tt>dir<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/x</tt> will do the trick and show the 8.3 names. This works for those 'undeletable' files and folders.
