<p>Managed to irritate someone in the IRC room on aniverse that I had been testing in occasionally.  (I like to read through logs of Yaz and other people to see what's entertaining them most.)  Made a joke that I was going to create a one-dimensional bot to imitate him, and I thought he knew it was a joke, but he didn't, and he left.
<P>
Hey, Deon, if you're reading this, it really was a joke.  I never had anything like that made, and I'm not considering it.  It was just a joke.
<P>
Anyway, I added a 50/50 split; it will either change r's to l's or l's to r's.  I've seen a few translations either way now.  (Which is odd, really.)
<P>
Another neat suggestion was made to build IRCbots that *fight*.  Hit points, stats, etc., and you set them on each other.  I actually kind of wonder what it would look like.  :)</p>
