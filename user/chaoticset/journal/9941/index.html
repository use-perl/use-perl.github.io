<p>Hey, the good news is right there!  <A HREF="http://www.masonbook.com/book/">Embedding Perl in HTML with Mason</A> is online!
<P>
Gorgeous.  I have no problem with HTML::Template, but Mason's what's in demand and I've been bugging myself to start reading this book.  I don't own it yet, but now I'll have the chance!
<P>
In other news, I got a speeding ticket.  Sigh.  Long, long sigh.  I speed up and down the highway all day long, 90 mph one way, 90 mph back, pass ten or twelve cops a month doing this...and the one time I open the throttle up to 60 on a back road that's marked 45, a cop passes me, turns around, and gives me a ticket.  Selective enforcement is total bullshit.
<P>
And anybody who says that speeding isn't <EM>really</EM> breaking the law needs to ask themselves why the law exists.  If selective enforcement is expected -- nay, encouraged -- then the law means nothing, the <EM>cop</EM> is the final arbiter of what the law is because any violation is <EM>technically</EM> illegal, but you'll only be charged/convicted/fined with the ones the cop cares to bother with.
<P>
Of course, it's hard to look at any system with zero tolerance and find anything charitable about it either.  The world is a place of grays, if only because we speak about it with such poorly defined words and think about it with such poorly defined thoughts.  The difference between one day and the next is minimal, yet if it's the difference between the last day of your 20th year and the first of your 21st, drinking a beer is no longer illegal.  If it's the difference between the last day of your 17th and the first day of your 18th, you get to vote, it's legal to have sex with you, etc.
<P>
These are numbers as arbitrary as anything else, in place because nobody's willing to attempt to come up with a better system.
<P>
That, or there is no better system.  I refuse to believe that, though.
<P>
Anyway, I'm in a philosophical mood because I'm waiting.  After a few more CDs of archived sound information (leftovers, I believe, from a culture preservation program -- an attempt to record a great deal of local oral history) finish burning, I'm writing the RedHat 7.0 install disk images to blanks and attempting an installation.  Some of the older hardware from this place is still floating around, and the request has been made to find out if anything interesting can be done with it.
<P>
I'm very, very tired, and very, very stressed...but at this point, it's better than not being tired and not being stressed, so I'm happy but busy.
<P>
I'm looking to attempt to find some sort of low-experience position at <A HREF="http://jobs.perl.org/">jobs.perl.org</A>, because any experience I can get at this point is a step in the right direction.  It turns out there's actually a few web design places in Maine, and while it remains to be seen whether they're hiring, they might be looking to catch a young, possibly talented individual such as myself.</p>
