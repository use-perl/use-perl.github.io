<p>Scouring Borders for tech books recently, for the first time in quite a while, and what do I see?  Perl Bookshelf 3 -- with Mastering Perl/Tk, with Perl & LWP, with Perl & XML...!
<P>
This irritated me for a while, until I realized I could now just purchase physical copies of the last two and I'd have everything in Perl Bookshelf 3.  :)  Yummy.  My love/hate relationship with the last Perl Bookshelf was due to the fact that I could easily transport it, but unfortunately could not browse it as night reading.  Now, I'll be able to sleep on top of copies of Perl & XML and Perl & LWP!
<P>
Well, once I actually purchase them, which won't be far off here, most likely.  I can usually convince myself that self-gifting is okay around Christmas time, and I typically recieve a few Borders certificates anyway.
<P>
On to actual work-related things:  The code I used to glue together multiple listboxes.  Still crude, because I've got to provide a unified interface to them and I haven't done that yet, but they select together, and when one is selected the others show that same selection; drag-selecting moves them all to the last one dragged to, as I intended.
<P>
It's always spiffy when a plan comes together.
<P>
I am worried that selecting on each one will actually trigger selections on each one, which could cause problems; probably, the easiest way around that would be to catch and nullify the selection events of three of the listboxes, so that one is always bringing up the email text popup.
<P>
Every once in a while I hit a major snag in the code and become tempted to post to Perlmonks, and I've found that, typically, it's not a major snag -- I only thought it was.  If I throw another twenty minutes at the problem after I become desperate, usually it kind of unravels.
<P>
Someday soon here, I'll actually be kind of useful.  :D</p>
