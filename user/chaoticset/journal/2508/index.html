<p>I don't know how these deranged notions come to mind, but I have this image in my mind of a superhero called Cheese Monkey.  He's a monkey with a yellow latex suit and a cheese gun, and one of those cheese-hats.
<P>
Anyway, in actual computer-related things, I've been rooting around on WF.  I'm both impressed and underwhelmed; their explanation of the situation implied that there would be several working Win clients, and there simply aren't, looks like.  I'll probably work it from Cygwin, which (natchurly) I'll have to reinstall on the home machine.
<P>
I've managed to get all my various interconnecty things to work from school now:  Trillian travels well (which is to say it doesn't have a lot of registry keys or need a lot of such-n-such in certain places) so I installed it to a Zip disk.  If I get ambitious I'll write something to fix the log-file rift that this creates (logs on the Zip being separate and different from logs on my home drive).
<P>
Got most of my math quiz done.  Wretched paths on relations!  The book's explanation of this is hideously algebraic, and I do better with geometric descriptions.  I'll slog through it sometime when I get home.
<P>
The Monastery's front gate is open, but my pass card doesn't work.  Oh, the snafus...  :\</p>
