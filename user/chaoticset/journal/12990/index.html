<p>I hit the hay pretty hard last night around 7:30, and woke up this morning at 9.  13.5 hours wasted of my weekend time!
<P>
Regardless, I've been shanghaied off to breakfast whether I like it or not, and have only a few scant moments to recount the notions from this morning.
<P>
Firstly, it occurred to me that once this whole thing's working and in place, that a graphic display of rules, result rules, and the whole range of results possible as three different PNG files would be useful, and a Perl/Tk interface wrapped around the tools that generate these images would be uber-handy.  (Yes, I'm already working on metatools to affect these fuzzy systems, and I also realize just how pointless it will be if I cannot create the fuzzy system itself.)
<P>
Unfortunately, my mental wranglings with the system for calculating "curves" in this have led me to the conclusion that I'm going to have to perform three passes.
<P>
In the first pass, turn all firing rules into the equivalent triangles.
<P>
In the second, calculate all overlaps and add y values.
<P>
In the third, determine if any points are completely bounded within other points, and remove them if they are.
<P>
This should produce the final curve no matter how many inputs are coming in, which was what I'd hoped to implement in the future.  I can't imagine any reason this won't work, so it's technically good news.  It just comes with a huge pile of tedium (both in the coding and testing, because this thing's going to have plenty of places I can go wrong) and probably significant speed issues.  (There's already lots of square-rooting that I'm doing in other places per input, so this is going to increase the math overhead significantly.)</p>
