<p>Tried something -- the Makefile.pl file had Unix line-endings, and someone on some newsgroup seemed to think it was related to that, so I ran it through PFE's conversion utility and tried again.  No go.
<P>
I did manage to forget something that totally irritates me, although I'm sure there's a good reason I'm not aware of because I've been slacking off on keeping up with Perl Stuff In General:  Log::Easy <EM>requires</EM> Perl 5.8.
<P>
I felt bad enough looking at the docs on Log::Easy (I had smacked around the concept of writing Log::Simple only a half year ago, same idea only not as well done) and realizing that it was simple, straightforward and something I wanted to try immediately.  I felt worse realizing that I would need to upgrade my entire Perl to do so...!  Feh.  I'm not that bright.  I'll just force it tomorrowish after work, or maybe Sunday when I've got the whole day to myself (insert bitter, knowing laughter here of a person who knows those words mean nothing in his life anymore) I'll do it then.  I mean, worst case scenario, I shove a round hole into a square peg and break part of my toy.  I'll just copy my toy.
<P>
Okay.  So that's "line-endings in the Makefile.pl are wrong", so far, just for my personal records.</p>

Perhaps check locale settings.
