<p>FROM MY LAST JOURNAL ENTRY:  "I need Cygwin. Guess what I'm doing for the next hour? Right. Finding, downloading, installing."
<P>
Next hour?!  HA HA HA HA HA HA.  And HA HA some more, too.
<P>
And that's all I have to say about THAT.
<P>
I almost died today.  Well, that's a little hyperbolic (is that a word form of hyperbole?), I guess.  My car was nearly struck by another car.  Very nearly.  (Note that I didn't say I was *nearly* in a car accident.  I was.  The other person didn't mean to do what they did, so that was an accident.)  They tried to turn right *through* my car.  I attempted to brake fast enough to prevent it, and also keep from hitting the lamppost.
<P>
They failed, I succeeded on both counts, and then I managed to recover quickly enough to see them at the stoplight ahead of us and assure them that I was fine - I was laughing my head off.  It's not often that I see a streetlight that close to my car.  :)
<P>
I did actually manage to flip a truck over once in a blizzard, rebound it off the trees, and land in the ditch.  I walked home.  Not even bruising, and I bruise pretty easy.
<P>
I guess I should be dead.  Good thing I'm not.  ;)
<P>
Bizarre behavior from the program.  Whatever I did *last* time with it, the checkboxes always cleared; whatever I'm doing with it now, they're not.  Really weird, since I'm doing identical stuff AFACT.  :\  Oh well, if it doesn't shake loose while I (fix|add to) the code, I'll shake it loose later.  Not a big deal right now, just something I figured I should document.
<P>
Friggin' Cygwin...!  I honestly thought it was small.  I didn't know what it was.  Clearly it's gonna be a lot more than I thought, because apparently the whole ball of wax weighs in around 55 megs.  (For .mp3 whores, that's about 10 songs, or 6 Pink Floyd songs, or 2 live Pink Floyd songs, with the thirty-minute guitar solos.)
<P>
I don't think I need all that, so I'll be doing a pick-and-choose, eventually figuring out what I need and doing the download.  I just find it funny that I thought 'oh, I'll just have it download everything and when I get home later, I'll set it all up'.  HA HA HA.
<P>
I still don't know why it's pretending some of the cards aren't in the inventory.  I have it *print* the inventory hash as it builds it, and bang, there's the card it says isn't there.  Maybe I'm destroying part of the hash somehow, but that seems very unlikely.  I don't even refer to it most of the time - built arrays of keys so I don't have to touch keys(%inventory).
<P>
Deep breath.  Fingers at home row.  Keep going.</p>
