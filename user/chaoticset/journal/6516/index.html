<p>I did indeed find the reference I was talking about several posts ago; the work was <A HREF="">jdavidb</A>'s, and the post was <A HREF="">this one</A>.  Upon examination, however, I realize that the changes he describes aren't precisely what I would need, though they parallel it.
<P>
I'm going to start plumbing the modifications I'd written to WWW::UsePerl::Journal, see if I'd managed to produce the things I'd needed or not, and request from jdavidb the changes he made so that I might look over them.  If one changes my requirements so that the other isn't necessary, that's good too; if one fails, then perhaps the other will succeed.
<P>
So, um.  jdavidb!  If you're reading this -- could I take a look at the modifications you made to WWW::UsePerl::Journal?  Large piles of thanks in advance...</p>

<h2>Back</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-07-29T16:45:13</h3>
<p>Been out of town for a week.  (No, <a href="http://www.singingschool.net/" title="singingschool.net">not</a singingschool.net> at OSCON.)</p>

<p>As I recall the change centered around the text pulled from the user info page.  The text is different (for your own user info page) based on whether you're logged in or not.  Basically I just needed a less specific regular expression.  A workaround was to change the order of statements in the script to make the module get your user info before you log in.  Or something.  Been awhile.</p>

<p>I'll try to remember to post the change at some point; it's on my home laptop and I'm at work.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>You post too many entries, man!  If I hadn't clicked "previous 10," I never would've seen it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
