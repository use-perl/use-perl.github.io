<p>I've hit a happy medium; I'm alternating between Visine when my eye's irritated (to reduce the inflammation) and water when my eye's irritated (to flush it out more thoroughly).  I can see again.
<P>
For a few hours after my first class today, I was literally leaving the eye shut all the time, even while driving, in order to reduce my urge to rub it.
<P>
(And yes, I'm aware of the depth perception risk.  However, as any one-eyed person will tell you, there are other ways to ensure accurate depth perception.  You just have to be aware of it.)
<P>
Got a GREAT link for a Lisp book!  BazB over at the Monastery gave me it; it's, uh...well, I can't remember the link or the title, but it came highly recommended in other places.  Apparently the author put it on the web when it went out of print.  I hope more authors do that; it would be a nice trend (and a lot of saved money tracking down old stories).
<P>
My 135 class looks like most of my classes have always looked:  25% fluff, 25% stuff I mostly know, 50% stuff that'll keep me awake.  The trick is focusing my attention on the 50% of interesting stuff.  Shouldn't be hard; this is a class I took before and wished, at the end, that I had paid more attention to.  I will this time.
<P>
Don't have any homework between now and Thursday; tomorrow is my 7:00 Discrete Math II class.  Right now, I have a little under twelve hours.
<P>
Oh, and I had a weird idea for a web-based calendar system to keep track of my homework with.  I'd have to run it through the www.perlmonk.org servers, so I'd have to get space there first, and write it, and all...
<P>
...hm.  Wonder if there's anything like that already?  Should check around and see before I start coding it.  Would seem simple enough, though.</p>
