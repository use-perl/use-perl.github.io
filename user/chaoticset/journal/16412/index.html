<p>Yesterday I took advantage of the fact that I was stuck at Best Buy for an hour, waiting patiently to pick up a friend from work (transit back home is 15 minutes, and going home to sit around for 30 minutes didn't seem worth it) to try out <EM>Ratchet And Clank</EM>.
<P>
I haven't played a cartoonish platformer in a while, and about twenty minutes into the endeavor, said friend who works at Best Buy says that the phone's for me.  What?
<P>
It is.  The SO has called, actually wanting to leave a message for me to contact work ASAP as they need someone.  This can be chalked up to an irritating coincedence.  So far, anyway...
<P>
Today, while waiting for the laundry to dry and talking to an ex-co-worker, I hear my name, and realize that the person working the counter at the laundromat has a call for me.
<P>
Is there some way to detect if you've been LoJacked?</p>

<h2>Try This!</h2>

Ignore the phone call!  <br> If it isn't your signifcant other, who cares who it is?

Both times, it was my significant other.  I just found it, well...<em>odd</em>.
<p>
It wasn't even that I didn't want the phone calls -- they were both about important stuff.  I'm just used to being able to dodge the phone if I don't own a cell and I'm not home, and...now, it seems, I'm not.

I'm just waiting for the day I get a call over the PA at the mall somehow.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:\</p>
