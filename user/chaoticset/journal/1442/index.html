<p>Wow...comments.  I didn't mean to run out onto an old battlefield and start shooting, folks, sorry.
<P>
I suspect it's a problem with me.  (That is, I think I'll be better off trying to build the thing myself instead of working through an installer.  (I know, I'm probably wrong.))  I'm working with 120 megs of hd space, 10 of that for the swapfile, and the base installation package that the installer would provide was around 169.
<P>
The problem here, really, is the installer, not Red Hat.  Please don't hit me!  :)  I would pick the smallest bunch of things I could imagine needing (and I don't really know what I need for this, I'm really just fartin' around here) and it would start the installation before it told me how much drive space that it would take up.
<P>
The smallest I could get it with regular options was, as I said, 169.  I fiddled around, found I could pick specific things out of the option list, and did that; I shaved it down to a sleek 82 megs...which didn't work.  "Some of the things you've selected require other things..."  Something to that effect.  I let it pick the needed components and then it couldn't access the data for some bizarre reason; it said, I believe, that the drive was not 'mounted'.  (Odd, since it was 'mounted' enough to put a partition on five minutes beforehand.)
<P>
Now, I don't know what this means, so I'm...uh, I'm not giving up, I'm just trying something else.  If I really have a 'mounting' problem, it'll show up when I try the other thing.
<P>
Trust me:  I'm not *abandoning* anything mentally, I'm just getting sick of the installer and hoping something more hands-on will work (or at least help me understand the problem).
<P></p>
