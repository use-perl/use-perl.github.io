<p>I'm told that I talk in my sleep, and I've been told it my whole life.  Nothing new.  However, Laura says that I've been talking Perl in my sleep.
<P>
Now, I've always been interested in what might result from such things (assuredly not gorgeous code, but perhaps interesting stuff nonetheless), so I'll be making an effort to record it in some fashion.
<P>
Maybe I should lay off the O'Reilly books for a day or two.  Just until I start babbling about ducks and piles and clouds again.  :\</p>

<h2>Dream in Perl</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-06-18T14:45:18</h3>
I was dreaming in Perl within the first week of reading the pink Llama book.  I took it as a sign.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)



<h2>Dreaming in Code</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2002-06-19T23:12:43</h3>
I don't think I dream in code.  But I have been known to think/speak in code when I wake tired in the morning.
<p>
About a year ago, I was writing an intro to XSLT course.  One morning, I swear I was wide awake, very tired and started talking about "instantiating towel templates".  Went back to sleep, and when I got up the second time, I spoke in a language that more closely resembled English.
</p><p>
I was reading a Lisp book as I fell asleep last night, and this morning I was thinking in Lisp macros.  Pretty strange, that.</p>
