<p>I got sidetracked.
<P>
What can I say...?  The old allure of games drags my brain around every once in a while.  (Well, a lot, but...not as much as it used to.)  While I was searching around for something to author within (there's some long-term kinda game projects I've been toying with for a few years, and I'm still looking for the software that can support them), I found <A HREF="http://www.croteam.com/engine_features.shtml">this link</A>.
<P>
Now, if you played _Serious Sam_, you know what I'm saying when I claim it's a gorgeous, gorgeous FPS.  It is eye-meltingly beautiful and the attention to detail is shocking.
<P>
The engine is no less beautiful and amazing.  I keep waiting to find a down side to it of some sort; but I keep reading and find nothing.
<P>
I had forgotten just how beautiful it was; as I remember now, I'm going to reinstall it and fire it up.
<P>
Ugh.  It's 3.  Maybe I should go to bed.
<P>
Especially seeing as how I'm kind of babbling here.  *half-grin*</p>
