<p>I spent a truckload of time away from Perl, essentially, after my layoff in March.  Which, frankly, was fine.
<p>
I wasn't earning anything through Perl and I was having trouble learning anything about it.  Which, considering my social issues, my anxiety problem, and my ADD, wasn't terribly surprising.
<p>
As far as the ADD goes...well, I'm coming to the end of my second-to-last semester at school.  In May, I will finally graduate with my AD.
<p>
I'm not terribly well-credentialed in terms of past work or anything -- at least, nothing that I can honestly figure out a way to put my hands on -- and therefore have decided I'm going to build myself a Mason experiment, from scratch, with a few specific goals:
<ol><li>Use good coding practices during the entire project -- CVS, test-first, etc.
<li>Use good design -- clean, straightforward, feature-balanced.
<li>Interesting gewgaws.
</ol>
<p>
You might ask me -- why Mason?
<p>
Well, first -- it's installed at PM.  Second, it will stifle this incessant voice in my head that keeps hounding me that I <em>bought</em> a book on something, I better damned well <em>use</em> that something.
<p>
Third, of course...it does show up every now and then in job specifications...  :\
<p>
I'm only vaguely worried about job possibilities -- May's a long way off, and I'm going to start as soon as finals are over.
<p>
*breathes out deeply*
<p>
It's good to be back here.</p>
