<p>I have seen the doctor.
<p>
He agrees that it's probably GERD and not an actual heart problem, although he did schedule what I believe he referred to as a "stress echocardiogram".    More on this when it's available.</p>

<p>First, let me state that I am not by any means in shape.  I'm ~40 pounds overweight (giving myself the benefit of the doubt) with high blood pressure and high cholesterol.</p> <p>I asked my doctor to check the state of my heart two years ago, and had one of those echo-thingamajigs performed.</p> <p>Now considering my state (or lack thereof) of physical fitness, I was surprised that I passed with flying colors.</p> <p>Even MORE surprising, though, was that my calves were burning long before I felt that I was in any other discomfort.</p> <p>Oh, one other thing.  Depending on your own personal hairiness, you might have some other pain points as well... they dry-shaved me, the bastards.</p> <p>John</p>

My calves are pretty tight these days.  I'll get right on that.  Do you remember roughly what they had you do?
<p>
I think I was a little overweight before this happened, so now it's a lot worse than it really should be.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(
</p><p>
Uh...shaved?!  Shaved.  Where?  All over?</p>

<p>They put me on a treadmill, and increased the incline and speed every few minutes, checking my blood pressure as they increased the incline.</p>
<p>And no, not shaved all over, just the spots where they attached the leads for the echowhatsis.  If you're hairy-chested, you're going to be in some discomfort.</p>
