<p>Well, actually, it's an entry, but it's not a REAL entry, it's...
<P>
...okay, I guess it's an entry.
<P>
I came to a great conclusion during English class.
<P>
"...then comes the fun of sorting it...how on earth am I going to sort this whole mess...?"
<P>
So it occurs to me that if I made the whole thing a *circular list of arrays*...
<P>
Well, let me explain.
<P>
The new inventory is a short, probably alphabetic, list of products (okay, they're Magic The Gathering singles, but I didn't want to refer to something copyrighted in here) and numbers.
<P>
The main inventory list itself is also alphabetic (it certainly will be if it's sorted like this every time I add inventory) and it occurred to me when I saw the <B>Cookbook</B> explanation _Implementing A Circular List_, if I had both of them (or even just the main file) set up as a circular list, I could do some nifty things.
<P>
The problem was that in addition to adding all the entries, I had to make sure there were no duplicates.  My original notion was to solve this with a second pass, dropping the entries into the file in sorted order on the first, then removing duplicates on the second.  Bleah.  Line this...no fun.  Too hard.
<P>
Well, the thought came to me that if I do the *pass* into an array of arrays (or possibly a hash, with names for keys and numbers as a list for an entry), I can do all the manipulation I need, then delete the file and dump all the new data in.
<P>
Now, it turns out it's going to be easier.  If I do the first pass, and *do the comparisons as they are put into the circular list*, I can determine immediately whether I have to add cards and do it to the value when it's set, or add a whole new card altogether.
<P>
Which means that the new inventory adder is going to be significantly reduced in size from the 50-60 lines I thought it might become soon.  Saved code, saved sanity, and if this all works, I'll feel like I did it right.  That's what I'm going to be doing later, once I've got Chinese food here and three or four 2-liter Dew bottles.  There will be copious notes.
<P>
I love this stuff.</p>
