<p>I dislike NYE resolutions.  The very concept bothers me:  "Decide to improve yourself once a year."  I realize that's not quite what it's supposed to be, but that is how it's taken by most, I think.
<P>
Having said that, it seems like I'm going to have a few.  Quite a few, actually.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now that I know *why* I seemed to have such trouble at school and work and such, I fully expect myself to truly get things in gear.  I want to see a lot of credits show up the coming year.  I need to get a second line, in order to keep the business line clear (I think it's pointless to hand out business cards that have a phone number that's busy 75% of the time).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I need to deepen my appreciation of music.  Now, I already listen to a fairly diverse selection of things, I think.  Sure, about 50% of all the artists I listen to are partially technoish, but the other 50% make up a wide demographic.  However, I have deprived myself of classical music and study of it; I have also tried not to delve too deeply into study of any other music.  I need to study these things.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I firmly believe that a good thing in life is pursuing things one finds pleasurable.  As odd as it seems to type it, I find meditation extremely pleasurable at this point.  There are also some people I miss greatly; I need to bring them back to my life.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have a whole list of things on my node at monks that I've been interested in learning about:  Python, Ruby, OOP, etc.  I need to learn them.  Pretty straightforward.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I need more math.  I need lots more math.  I read _A Tour Of The Calculus_ a while back, and flipped through the first 1/3rd of _Calculus Made Easy_, but I don't grasp second-tier stuff in it; I know some of the most basic things, and I understand a few of the most basic precepts.  I need to understand more of that.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
I have my package of business cards sitting out where I can see them any time I want.  I look at them sometimes.  They don't look like me; they look like someone else, someone more knowledgeable and with more experience.
<P>
I need to become that person.
<P>
Happy New Year to you, happy New Year to everyone else, and may this be the best year yet for all of us.</p>
