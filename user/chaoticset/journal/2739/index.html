<p>Went to bed around 4, got up at 7:30.  Feel awake and well-rested; best kind of overnight.  :)
<P>
Today's agenda is, now that I've managed to restore perl to the Zip disk, to fiddle around with the new things I've been reading about.  perlsub, most notably, was chock full of interesting stuff.  Especially about 'prototypes'.
<P>
Stumbled across an old friend's website; good to see that her sense of design is just as cluttered as ever.  Words splayed across the page, as if thrown there by accident; boxes existed in places boxes just shouldn't exist; dead link after dead link.  I suspect those are from disrepair, but the rest of it...
<P>
Part of the reason I chose the name Straightforward Designs was because I believe there's a lot to be said for a simple UI.  Making a web page with fancy-schmancy whatchamacallits everywhere, in my opinion, either alienates low-bandwidth readers (who wait five minutes for some horrid graphics and a huge Java applet to load before doing something simple, like viewing a forum thread) or else impresses twits.
<P>
Which is nothing on Java; I'm referring to unclear, unintentionally obfuscated web design.
<P>
That's the kind of thing I never wanted to do, never wanted to be known for, and never wanted to have to use.
<P>
Oh, and don't tell anybody, but I'm nearing friar.  :)  I'm always paranoid that if I say something in the CB I'll gain the attention of large clusters of personality voters, for whom my personality may not pass muster...</p>
