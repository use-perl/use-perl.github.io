<p>Slow going on the censor-aid (which, in retrospect, might have been a better name than the one I settled on).  Found Regexp::Common, though, and that should help significantly with the profanity regex.
<P>
No other Perly news, except that I'm trying to build a simple web-based calendaring system so that the various people who have dibs on my time these days can set up appointments without having to actually track me down or deal with each other.  Pretty much just indicating when things start/stop, removing activities, adding activities, preventing one activity from writing over another, and autopopulating with regular schedules (so that regularly scheduled standing appointments are easier to put in).  The version in my head shows five weeks, centered on the current week, and provides links to each activity and each individual date.
<P>
More as it comes...</p>

We use this as an online "uptime schedule", with people all over contributing; maybe you could use it as a codebase.<br> <br>It's the WebWebX WikiWiki codebase, drastically pruned and with extras added to create a multi-user calendar. Check out<br> <ul> <li> <a href="http://redhook.gsfc.nasa.gov/ims-bin/uptime-cal.cgi" title="nasa.gov">this</a nasa.gov> for how the application itself looks<br></li> <li> <a href="http://redhook.gsfc.nasa.gov/ims-bin/uptime-cal.cgi?Summary" title="nasa.gov">this</a nasa.gov> for how the quick summary looks</li></ul> <br> <br>If it looks useful, let me know and I'll see about getting you the code, or getting it onto the CPAN scripts site.<br> <br>Most of it is pretty easily alterable; all the text attributes, etc., can be set by the calendar admin, and the password maintenance is all done inside the application as well.

I'll have to take a second look when I've got a little more time, but I'd love to check the guts out.  You can drop a line to chaoticset at hotspam dot com, keeping in mind that I want <em>mail</em>, not <em>spam</em>.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

okay - you can grab the source <a href="http://ibiblio.org/emusic-l/uptime-cal-1.3.tar.gz" title="ibiblio.org">here</a ibiblio.org>.<br> <br>Have fun. I'm probably going to be doing some more on it pretty soon (more granularity of entries, aging, etc.). I'll let you know.
