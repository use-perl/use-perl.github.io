<p>I was about to post something fairly normal-looking here, and then I saw that little quote from Jarkko Hietaniemi (sp?) concerning haggis.  How disturbing.  Haggis is one of those things that I suspect people unfamiliar with it wouldn't immediately identify as food, such as sushi or (lord help me) vegemite or pork rinds.  (What they would probably be identified as, in order:  Bait, brewery waste, and packing materials.)  Haggis frightens me.
<P>
Some of the things we humans eat.
<P>
Anyway, that's not why I'm here; I'm here to spur myself to write a little more code before I fall asleep.
<P>
In an effort to organize my thinking, I organized my code (by what kind of sub it is -- all the text/HTML-throwing subs in one place, all the file handling in another, etc.) and printed a copy.  I am toying with the notion of trying to force a routine on myself for this code, but forcing routines on myself usually doesn't work.
<P>
The routine I have in mind:  Work on the code during work time.  Twenty minutes before work time is over, print a copy and don't touch the actual code again until the next work time.  Take the printed copy and write new code in the margins with arrows pointing to where it will go.  Next work time, pick up the printed copy, look at what has to be done, and do it.
<P>
Now, that all *sounds* fine and dandy to me, but I get the damndest notions at the damndest times.  It always seems easier to compose on the fly, even though I know that's caused some errors in the past.
<P>
I believe the term is mental diarrhea, isn't it?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Quick Addendum:  Well, I have been promised favors if I go to Wally World and retrieve various snacky things, along with perhaps a sum total of six liters of think-juice.  I think I'm up to the challenge; after that, well stocked with snacks and beverages, coding will commence.
<P>
And, while I'm gone, I will bring the paper copy to read while I stumble along, shopping in this post-holidaylyptic world.

<h2>Haggis</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-01-10T07:37:25</h3>
There's definitely good haggis and bad haggis out there. Watch out for cheapo butchers or supermarket haggis (I suspect that's not an issue for USians - haggis is probably hard to get in most supermarkets). When cooked it should have a delicate odour to it, not smell like boiled insides.
<br>
<br>The most delicious haggis I've ever had is at a small restaurant called Dubh Pres (pronounced presche, meaning "black pot") off the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. They serve the most amazing food there, and their haggis is a speciality. Instead of being wrapped in a bladder they very carefully wrap the contents in breadcrumbs and pan fry it. The taste is out of this world (but then so is everything else on their menu).
<br>
<br>And they serve haggis for desert too. I kid you not.
