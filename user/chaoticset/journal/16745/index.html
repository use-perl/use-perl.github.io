<p>I was just about to post a huge, vaguely malevolent journal entry here, and decided it wasn't...what's the adjective I'm looking for here?  <EM>Professional</EM>?  <EM>Appropriate</EM>?
<P>
It occurs to me that there are probably very few people here with a vested interest in my journal entries being either of those things.  Perhaps I'm just not comfortable with myself these days.
<P>
There's a powerful sense of not belonging, a leftover of my life.  I don't know why I believe I don't belong here -- if there is a community of people who are more diverse, I'd be very curious as to what community that would be.  I guess it has to do with a lack of skills, perhaps (I hope) a <EM>percieved</EM> lack of skills.
<P>
I guess I worry a little too much about being irritating or stupid.</p>

<p>These feelings you describe are known to me.  I find that I get them most frequently when I'm not taking very good care of myself.  Inadequate sleeping time can trigger very foul moods and minor depression.  The most important thing to understand is that what you're experiencing is just a phantom or artifact of your biochemistry.  So, get a good night's rest after taking a long (45 minutes - 1 hour) walk.
