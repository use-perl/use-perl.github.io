<p>First, I thought I'd posted a journal entry about how I thought I'd posted a journal entry.
<P>
Second, I managed to leave <EM>two</EM> pots of water on the stove and not realize I had done so for over half an hour tonight.  Or was it three?
<P>
I found out why my script, now that I did my hokey little work around (more on that momentarily), managed to increment the cart to 4 when there were only 2 available on the shelf.  I forgot to subtract $got from $want before I updated the cart line.
<P>
Okay, hokey work-around time.  I found out that what I had been using before,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
open("filename.thg", FILE)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
won't create nonexisting files.  That's why the script was always crashing right after the logo and search box; it was checking for a file, not finding it, and wasn't able to create it.
<P>
Clearly, I had somehow been appending to the cart before I was reading the cart, which makes sense in my old transfer model; but in the new one, I have to know how many are in the cart before I can decide where anything's going, so I have to read it first.  If it's not there, that presents a problem.
<P>
So, in desperation to see the script do <EM>something</EM> properly again, I just added a call to my cart-appending sub in the cart-reading sub.  That's as sloppy as using the mayonnaise knife in the peanut butter jar, but at least I <EM>know</EM> it's that sloppy now.
<P>
Knowing is half the battle, or a third of a muffin, or something, right?  So that I can MAKE MONKEYS FAST?</p>

Looks like you could use the filetest operators (described in <tt>perldoc -f -X</tt> and <tt>perlfunc</tt>) and a helpful die with $! (see <tt>perlvar</tt>).  You also have the arguments to open backwards, but that could be a transcription error.

Funny.  I did put those down in reverse, didn't I?
<p>
I actually had a die, I just didn't do it here.  The thing was that $! was "No such file or directory" on die, and I had been using the append open mode to create new cart files if they didn't exist.  I made the error of calling the file earlier than I previously ever had.
</p><p>
I got so confused about the open modes that I printed the Camel page it's on, and posted it on the wall next to me.  Just called in the wrong order, I think.  Once I fix that, the problem will sort itself out.</p>
