<p>I'm toying idly with the idea of <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/ref=sc_bb_l_3/104-0116842-1154342?no=3435361&me=A36L942TSJ2AJA&node=3434671">signing up to develop Amazon apps</A>.
<P>
Emphasis on the <EM>idly</EM>.  I'm not a huge Amazon user, I don't like their patenting, etc., but on the other hand, it may just be too cool to pass up.  I'll have to look at it in more depth.
<P>
In other news, I'm wondering just how often I should find myself getting sick of looking at a specific project.  Is it generally accepted practice that working on one and only one project causes stagnation?
<P>
Or, if a project is large enough, is switching between different parts of the project (say, from the UI to the internals) generally enough to provide a contrast?</p>

Huh, I just 30 minutes ago downloaded the SDK and applied for a developer token.<br>
<br>
I tend to believe that working too much on one task can cause stagnation.  Yes, if the project is large enough, it can help to alleviate the <i>strangled</i> feeling, but even the largest project can seem small after a long enough time.
<br> <br>
I don't even know if I'll ever do any kind of Amazon program, but the idea seems interesting.  Who knows?

Well, there might be incentive -- it appears that some people believe there's a salable product in writing an Amazon app and setting it up for the right customer, and I'm not sure they're wrong.  (I don't know that they're right, per se, but it can't hurt to look.)
<p>
I also just signed up for my PAUSE id, so I'll see if I get that later today.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
