<p>It's rare that I am able to look at myself and honestly evaluate that my reactions of ludicrous proportions to the incident.
<P>
Which is to say, I generally don't think I overreact.  (Although tonight I seem to be laborious and methodical in my verbiage, probably overly so.)
<P>
I'm really not trying to spew these sentences out, trust me.  I think it's just the first time I've been awake this late in at least a couple of weeks, and it's had some sort of effect on me.
<P>
Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that I need to understand just how <EM>unimportant</EM> the average job application truly is.  If I apply for a job, odds are I won't hear anything back, especially if it's being applied for via email.
<P>
I <EM>need</EM> to understand that.
<P>
Once I do, I won't attach such significance to each job offer I see somewhere.  I won't wait eagerly for any replies, I'll merely note if they happen in and not mistake them for spam.  I'll be more casual about the whole event.
<P>
My blood pressure's gone up twenty points or so, and I've gained probably around ten pounds over my standard weight since mid-highschool.  My body's been going through serious stress reactions and I haven't been taking the appropriate countermeasures, and my body's been taking hard hits because of it.  I Need To Calm Down A Whole Freakin' Bunch.
<P>
So I will.  Starting now.  I'm going to send the application, complete with what I hope is a good example of my work and --
<P>
Urgh.  Now I have to convince myself that I <EM>have</EM> good examples of my work.
<P>
-- like I said, I'm going to send an application with a price and an example and I'm just going to pretend I never sent it at all after that.  If something shows up, it's time to crack out the champagne, and if nothing shows up (according to plan) I won't even notice.</p>

That is the best plan possible.<br> <br>Once, back in the '80s, I sent out ~<b>200</b> resumes and cover letters to targeted job inquiries.<br> <br> (You know, I mean in response to posted job applications in the newspapers, not just cold-call letters asking for a job).<br> <br>
I got <b>two</b> responses saying "No thanks".<br> <br>  All the rest just disappeared into limbo.<br> <br>
So, if you <i>even</i> get a response, be happy.  If you get a job, be ecstatic!<br>

About the first link:  Thank you, thank you, thank you!
<p>
About the second:  I had heard about this years ago, but I might actually have the chance to track it these days, so I may give it a shot.  There's also the good chance that once my stress levels return to normal (which is happening already) and my blood pressure goes back down, my weight will return to its relatively static value.</p>

<p>Don't thank me; thank <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/petdance/" title="perl.org">Andy Lester</a perl.org>.</p>

<p>I found that after I graduated college my weight immediately went up ten pounds.  It slowly crept up another 16 until I was diagnosed with cholesterol problems.  My low fat diet started slowly draining the weight off, without my being concerned much with calories.  I'm currently tracking my weight as described in the hacker's diet, and following the fitness program.  I'll probably start using the meal planning described in the book some day soon to get rid of my last few pounds or so.</p>

<p>In my case, the stress of college actually kept my weight down.</p>

Well, I'm such a head case that I have multiple types of stress.  Some I feed off of, some feed on me.
<p>
Good stress drops my weight ten pounds or so.  Bad stress makes it start to rise.  I haven't seen it fluctuate past 5+ in a few years, though, so it worried me.  (Especially along with the BP increase, that really worries me with my salt intake.)</p>
