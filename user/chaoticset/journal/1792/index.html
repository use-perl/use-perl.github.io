<p>Well, that and other things.  My natural impetus, when left with nothing to do, is find something to do.  (This is a result of my father's patient, numerous explanations to me that the rest of the world was not specifically there to entertain me.)
<P>
To that end, I've been puttering around the computer.  I've been looking for handy modules to add or start using, and I've been trying to learn <A HREF="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=117316&lastnode_id=6364">Object-Oriented Programming and a few other things.</A>
<P>
I think I get the basic idea.  I just need to A) Read more about how it's actually done, and B) Make myself write a few examples and see if they work.
<P>
Mostly the second part, I think.
<P>
On the useless end of things, I've been playing M&M VII.  Honestly, I liked VI a little bit more, but it's still quite engaging.  Seems like the death machine curve isn't quite there (in VI, I was always just on the brink of dying up to a certain point, and from then on I could slay almost anything) but it seems to lack the grand scope.
<P>
It's also reminded me of part of the reason I so desperately want to excel in the programming arts:  Games.  I want to be able to write games.  I want to be able to write bizarre, immersive games that make a person's brain run circles around itself and scream.
<P>
Eventually, I suspect, there could be an Ultimate Gamer tournament.  Unlike the Q3A tourneys and such, this would measure your ability in a variety of genres:  The FPS portion could take place in a few hours, same for fighting games, and then the RPG portion might take a few weeks, and the puzzle portion would be maybe a whole day...you get the idea.  There could be an assload of awards, one for the best competitor in each event, and then the Ultimate Gamer trophy would go to the best overall competitor.
<P>
I'm so glad school's out for now.
<P>
I have roladen steak in the fridge thawing for tomorrow.  (I won't be making roladen out of it, though.  Probably steak sandwiches or stir-fry.)
<P>
Oh, and I helped my <A HREF="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=121829&lastnode_id=6364">shallow half-brother</A> today.  He needed to fix a few things on his massive resume, and whether I like it or not, I can't charge him just because I know my way around a word processor.
<P>
Yet.  *evil grin*</p>
