<p>I generally dislike being surprised by a gift.  Typically, the people getting me gifts have ended up getting me the wrong gift in some fashion, and I have a hard time putting on "the face".
<p>
As such, R decided to show me my present before purchase, and it was a good thing and a bad thing.  It's a <a href="http://www.timex.com/datalink/index.html">watch</a> that manages to actually fit my wrist, which is no small feat.  It's also meant to provide appointment/timer/etc. storage, and has a USB link.  This is not astounding.  Skimming through the poster-sized manual before purchase, I noted happily that it can take in CSV files, so I had hoped that I would merely cobble together some Perl scripts to massage various things together.
<p>
However, in going to the website, Timex has two things for this watch that absolutely floor me:  <a href="http://www.timex.com/developer/datalink/">Developer resources, complete with SDK</a> and a <a href="http://www.timex.com/developer/datalink/legal.html">legal agreement that doesn't sound draconian</a>, but actually seems to encourage production of new products for the USB link.  In fact, it goes so far as to provide what sound like strict but fair guides for <em>advertising</em> said products if you create them, and doesn't seem at all interested in controlling anything but the trademark and where people go for tech support.
<p>
I'm pleasantly surprised by my unsurprising but pleasant gift.  :)  Expect more in this space about anything neat I manage to create for said watch.</p>
