<p>A couple of rum and cokes.  Stress has been killing me lately.
<p>
I am way too stressed.  I blame this on my inability to play <em>Halo</em>*, because shooting things has always been very therapeutic for me.
<p>
Monday, in an attempt to provide myself with distraction and exercise, I will be going along with a friend of mine to the gym he goes to.  I have no details but it's better than sitting around Monday night, obsessing about heading in to work in less than 12 hours.  :\
<p>
I'm probably going to head offline in a few minutes and attempt to install Slack on this machine.  (I understand that it has a partitionless install option, so I'm probably going to do that first and leave X out so I can fart around with the console, and get some idea of what the installation process is like.)
<p>
I'm not remotely tired at this point.

<h2>Halo</h2>

Halo can be quite therapeutic, but holy cow can it eat time. I get into an online game and suddenly 2 hours have gone by.<br> <br><br/><br/>"Just one more game and I'm done..."

My previous experiences with playing online were pre-broadband 56k modem stuff, so I've got quite a bad taste in my mouth from R4nd0m 5h1tHedz doing dumb shit constantly, and haven't felt the DEEP NEED to get broadband in order to play online yet.  Although I do miss the furious trash talking.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<p>
Oh, eventually I'll have to do it, just to see what it's like, at least.  At that point, I will probably find out that I have absolutely no spare time left for trivial things like eating and sleeping.  Gaming used to consume me in disturbing ways.</p>

<h2>Slack Gym</h2>

<p>
Good luck with the Slack installation. May it work as you wish!</p>
<p>
Take it easy at the gym if you haven't been exercising much. A little can be a lot if 'Long time, no gym'.</p>

Believe me, I'm not planning to jump in and attempt to finish a marathon or anything.  Just some movements in a desperate attempt to make my body reclaim lost muscle tissue.

Reclaim lost muscle tissue? Oh, that's easy. I've done it a dozen times.</p>
