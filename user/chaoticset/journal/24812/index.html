<p>Need to get used to CVS.  I can do CVS.  I can do test-driven.  I have, with exactly one project, managed to do test-driven development and regular CVS commits.  I need to get the hang of this.
<p>
Need to build a portfolio site, still.  Damn.
<p>
Need to work on the module idea I had for a color-matching algorithm.  (While I'm probably not the best person to write it, hell, <em>I</em> need one.  I can get some people to improve it later.)
<p>
<blockquote>&lt;huey-lewis-impression&gt;I need a new <em>editor</em>...&lt;/huey-lewis-impression&gt;</blockquote>
Need to post here more regularly.  I have four years of journal entries, some of them apparently worth reading; I'm wondering if it would be a shame to let that die off.
<p>
Applied for more jobs today.  Seriously considering work as a pizza delivery guy at this point.  Have sent a volunteering app to the < a href="http://www.mesda.com/">MESDA</a>; it's not like I couldn't use the experience.
<p>
Concerta, Concerta...where have you been all my life?  Fatigue, gone.  Thinking, more flexible and easier to organize.  I can keep a three-list item in my head over a period longer than ten minutes without writing it down.
<p>
Another nice side effect with the Concerta is that my natural memory for numbers is less unfocused, so I've found that I can actually do a lot better with remembering phone numbers and costs and such than I used to.
<p>
Need to DDR, but loaned the mat and game to an aquaintance.  It'll have to wait until Monday.
<p>
Need to report good news -- I'm signed up for classes this fall.  My therapist said that it was definately time to get things moving on the academic front, and so they are.  Not only did I sign up in one day (unprecedented, believe me), but I have also managed to get my financial aid application in within a few days time of the class registration.  Those around me have assumed that the end of days is coming, since I can now do things, even if they involve paperwork sometimes.</p>
