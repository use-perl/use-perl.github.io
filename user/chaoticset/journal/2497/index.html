<p>If I actually get to work on the program today it'll be a surprise.
<P>
I did manage to fix something the other day, but I feel certain I posted about it.  (I wasn't decrementing the amount in the inventory by the amount wanted for the cart, if I didn't post about it.  No biggie, but I chased my tail for a while figuring it out.)
<P>
I still haven't figured CVS out.  I'll throw a few more hours at it Wednesday, in all likelihood.
<P>
I'm hoping, really really hoping, that if the courseload is stable and stays around where it is (virtually nothing), then I'll be able to either pick up a job to supplement our income or else work a lot on the GUICS and perhaps Worldforge.  Or, if I'm really lucky, some of both.
<P>
It's probably totally irrelevant, but it was really good to see Stephen King last night in _Rose Red_.  Since he's started staying in Florida (apparently for health reasons after he got hit by that truck), you hardly see him in Bangor anymore.  It's kind of a shame, since he was really the only local celebrity we had that most people had ever heard of.
<P>
Also -- if anybody knows what's going on with the Monastery, please let me know.  Internal Server Errors and 'We're experiencing technical difficulties, obviously.' are disheartening.</p>

<h2>PM is moving servers</h2>

that's prolly why you're experiencing outages.  They set up a <a href="http://moving.perlmonks.org/" title="perlmonks.org">moving server</a perlmonks.org> to tell more details...

Err<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... looks like that's down, too.
