<h2>31 but....</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2004-09-10T15:38:51</h3>
I have been working on my social skills since junior school, and especially hard since university.
<p>
When I was young I did a few things that I spotted in tCIotDitN such as seperating food on the plate, and deciding if it would be a good day or bad day based on wierd criteria, my wife still hates the way I double-check any door I lock and take so long to clean anything or washup.
</p><p>
My Wife and mother in law both reckon I have difficulty with eye-contact and stuff and insist I always answer the phone or talk to people in social situations to improve it.
</p><p>
I don't get these problems in a professional context -- when at work I am a lot more confident and outgoing, even bossing people around in a way I would never do with family and friends.
</p><p>
my sister-in-law is the same, really shy at home but as a personal trainer in a law firm she wipes the floor with high-flying lawyers and managers.
</p><p>
I don't think I was ever close to having any actual medical problem but that could be because my family spotted problems early and still keep up the pressure to 'be normal'.
</p><p>
Oddly, the positions I am applying for at the moment are senior roles which involve a lot of the kinds of things my family would expect me to find hard but have never been an issue in the workplace.
</p><p>
Maybe its because in work environments I know how things are supposed to happen and have confidence in my experience and skills.</p>



<h2>13 for me.</h2>

Party on, wayne.  Party on, garth.
<p>
However, I suspect that if I had scored this test 15 years ago, I'd be much higher. (Not literally, but you know what I mean.)
</p><p>
Thank goodness I'm a <i>recovering geek</i>... I'm in a one-four-base-eight step program.  It seems to be working.</p>



<h2>Just 41...</h2>

... yet I've always been told I have traits that point towards authism. I enjoy spending time all by myself.
