<p>I don't even know if that word can be legally applied to me - considering how little I really am doing - but it's all I can come up with.  For a while it seemed like I couldn't even touch the PFE program at all, not even to look at code.
<P>
That, plus this whole episodic memory thing.
<P>
I came online and came here and looked at Recent Updates, and saw myself on there, and thought:
<P>
"But I haven't updated in three or four days!"
<P>
Sigh.  I updated Tuesday, and I really didn't remember doing it.  Even reading it, I can barely remember *thinking* those things.
<P>
Anyway, I am actually working tonight.  My factual memory has no such problems, it would seem.
<P>
The issue now is that I'm having trouble understanding the CGI module; and as <A HREF="www.reciprocality.org">some people will tell you</A>, understanding is important to some people.  Me, for one.  Hopefully everybody at the site.
<P>
I'm starting to actually worry about this.  The accounts I have read of those with brain damage that precipitates severe memory formation problems are very, very troubling.
<P>
I suppose it's good that I remember reading them.  I wrote down my appointment date, so I won't forget it.  If I have to, I'll write it on my arm every day.
<P>
Back to the CGI module, and figuring it out, piece by piece.
<P>

Quick Addendum:  <A HREF="http://world.std.com/user/swmcd/steven/perl/idiom.html">This</A> has helped immensely in understanding Perlspace.
<P>
Oh, and if you *are* looking for something to waste oodles of time with, check out <A HREF="www.theunderdogs.org">the home of the underdogs</A>, where great batches of old games are available for download.  One in particular is excellent:  _The Fool's Errand_, a huge puzzle game built around a map, a story, and the tarot.
