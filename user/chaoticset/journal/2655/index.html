<p>I sure as hell can't think of one.
<P>
I think I just finished my homework for the Monday class -- in class -- again.  I should probably feel happier that it's not all that challenging, feel glad that I'm just getting it done so quick, but I don't.  I feel bored.  Lucky thing, though, that I get to <EM>leave class</EM> when I'm done.  I like that feature in a class.  It's not as though I'm falling asleep yet, though.  No reason not to keep notes; keeping notes is usually how I figure things out in the long run.
<P>
Speaking of which, if I get more time after I finish my assignments for tomorrow, I'll work some more OO cantrips before I sleep.  I don't have to go to bed too too early, but I'd like to hit the sack before 5 or so.
<P>
Trillian keeps hitting speedbumps (AIM connection problem one day, Yahoo connection problem the next); nothing on the creators (two guys who are doing a damn sight better than <EM>I</EM> could), because it's not like it pays their bills.  I'm just pointing it out.  Perhaps Yahoo and AOL are really trying to prevent Trillian access, but I really can't see them doing anything that intelligent.  Perhaps I'm underestimating them, though.
<P>
Well, I'm going to get the teacher's attention and see if my work fits the needed criteria; if it does, then I'm outta here.</p>
