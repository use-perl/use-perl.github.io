<p>Well, I seemed to remember something in the Cookbook about pulling sentences out of text, so I went searching for the regex grab-bag in there.  Found it, did it.  Got a problem.
<P>
It's showing really funky behavior; on the simple test text:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Chiseling bastard, with his monkeys and cheese!  Whenever the rolling doily
hits the left wing, the whole plane shudders a few times, and burning things
fly out of the engine.  That's probably bad, huh?
<BR><BR>
Where am I?<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
it drops the last line completely on the output.
<P>
I still need to fiddle around a little more to make sure it's not working right -- the first text I tested with was pretty screwed up, all random punctuation and such (I wanted to see how robust this method was), but missing a sentence out of something with such normal punctuation isn't good enough.
<P>
I also have to leave for now, but I expect to get a chance to Perl a little again later, sometime after I watch _Blue Velvet_.  It will be the first David Lynch movie I ever see.  :)
<P>
I hope that's a good thing.</p>

<h2>Blue Velvet</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/shockme/">shockme</a> on 2002-02-17T01:18:04</h3>
It's a kind of "out there" movie, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Dennis Hopper completely rocks, Isabella Rossallini is hot, and Laura Dern (one of my personal favorites) is, well, one of my personal favorites.
<p>
As a side note, this movie sparked somewhat of a comeback for Roy Orbison's music.  I don't want to spoil it for you, so I won't say anything else.
</p><p>
Enjoy!</p>
