<p>This weekend's been a blast of activity on my otherwise rather quiet social agenda.
<OL>
<LI>Met up with <A HREF="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=180961">Limbic~Region</A>, and he's a remarkably nice person, with interesting notions of the end of the world as we know it to boot.  :)</LI>
<LI>Managed to finish _Sanitarium_ over the weekend, and am pleasantly surprised at its level of entertainment.  Excellent purchase for less than ten dollars, but it's also available at <A HREF="http://www.the-underdogs.org/">The Home of the Underdogs</A> for free...</LI>
<LI>Last night, in a panic, I brought Reabena to the ER with Laura in tow.  She wasn't feeling her left side at all and indicated her extremities were all numb, and her legs were purple.  (So I'm told.  My color vision is not splendiferous, so I distrust it on principle.)  An EKG, chest X-ray, and peak flow test later, they determined that she hurt but weren't quite sure why, and provided her with some painkillers.  She still wasn't doing well this morning when we woke up around 5:40/6:20 AM, and I called in to work to try to make sure she's okay.</LI>
<LI>Laura's moving out, and one car load of boxes has managed to transit from here to there so far, leaving two/three to do today if possible.</LI>
</OL>
Another pleasant surprise was finding that L~R had read _Fuzzy Thinking_ some time ago, and didn't immediately decry it as a crock of shite, so that's a very good sign.  Reminds me to take a look at my fuzzy module and try to figure out whether it needs to be rewritten from scratch or just fixed.
<P>
I'd also like to take a look at the sorted hash module he's working on, but not because I think I can contribute -- doubtful! -- just because I'd like to see the implementation.  I need to ask him for a copy of the current stuff on it, so (note to self) please remember to do this, self.</p>
