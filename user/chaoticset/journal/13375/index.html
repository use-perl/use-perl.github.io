<p>Maybe I'm not cut out for the work I want to do.
<P>
Doubt is no enemy of mine -- doubt is a helpful friend.  Doubt helps me where it doesn't help others, because they <EM>feel bad</EM> about doubt.  I don't feel bad about doubting something I did or something I have -- if I never question it, it could be useless or worthless and I would never know it.
<P>
So the doubtful thinking leads me to the possibility that I'm not really made to be what I think I want to be, a freelance web person.
<P>
Maybe my doubt is correct.  Perhaps I really don't have the ability to sell myself, to seek out new jobs regularly, etc.
<P>
Now, the second one's not a huge huge issue -- people <EM>do</EM> occasionally find contracts longer than a week, I hear -- but I'm starting to think my doubt is dead on about me not being able to sell myself.
<P>
I don't even like the phrase.
<P>
Anyway, I've been looking through <A HREF="http://www.asktheheadhunter.com/">Ask The Head Hunter</A> and I'm starting to think maybe I should just ask someone else to sell me instead.  Maybe I should ask someone I know who doesn't seem terribly unable to sell things to people.
<P>
I used to be pretty good at it, I thought.  But I've spent a long time away from trying to convince people of things, and maybe I just kind of lost the knack.
<P>
So, I'm considering asking someone else to act as a headhunter for me.</p>
