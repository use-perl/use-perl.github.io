<p>Okay.  I pulled a McDonald's today.
<p>
I purchased coffee at a drive-through and managed to spill it on my lap not even ten minutes later, still blazing hot.
<p>
I've been to the E.R., and it looks like things are fine (fortunately, nothing more important than skin was seriously damaged; unfortunately, this means I have no chance of becoming sterile as a result of this).  Fine in the sense that I brought home a shopping bag of gauze, three prescriptions, and burn cream, but that's a lot better than, say, having my <em>face</em> burned, or chest, or hands, or feet, or whatever else.
<p>
So, uh, I might not be sitting down by tomorrow.  I was informed that I'd probably be sore as hell within ten hours, and that would be about tomorrow morning.  (Not that I post in here so regularly that anybody would notice if I didn't post for a few days, but I figured I'd get it out of the way.)
<p>
I'm a little proud to report that I finally took the plunge this morning and wiped my broken Mandrake installation, replacing it with Slack.  Things are good.  I'm still working some kinks out -- soundwise, for example -- but that's fine.  The times that I remember most fondly about my first computers were the times I spent farting around at the command prompt.  It's nostalgia, all over again!  :D
<p>
Getting a migraine.  Need to sleep anyway.  Exhausted.  Going.</p>

Did you know that <a href="http://lawandhelp.com/q298-2.htm" title="lawandhelp.com">there&#8217;s much more to the &#8220;McDonald&#8217;s lawsuit&#8221; than common folklore has it</a lawandhelp.com>? It&#8217;s tragically comical to consider the perversion of the case&#8217;s meaning over time.

I had read about it before and understood that it was not trivial litigation; I mentioned my blunder this way only because it was immediately obvious what I meant with a minimum of context.
<p>
Plus, I didn't wish to accidentally impugn the reputation of the fine establishment that served me that fateful beverage.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Just saying &#8211; because a lot of people don&#8217;t know. Including me, until quite recently.</p>

It is a fascinating thing, the application of blame.  Law is interesting.
<p>
Of course, I'm reminded of what is said to be an ancient Chinese curse:  "May you live in interesting times."</p>
