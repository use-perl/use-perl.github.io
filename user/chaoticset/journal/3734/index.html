<p>I have been hard-coding HTML all day.  I <EM>almost</EM> have a working, order-emailing placeholder site to hand "the client", so he can start taking bulk orders in a partially-automated fashion.  Should have it finished by sometime tomorrow, maybe tonight.
<P>
Perlwise...I've been using my fear to push me along on this HTML groove.  Not gonna Perl, gotta HTML, at least.  Had to rework some site graphics from scratch; turns out I wiped a bunch of important stuff when the hard drive went format-format in the repair shop.  NBD, just YAPITA.  (Sounds like something you can get at YogurtTime, doesn't it?  "I'd like a vegetarian YaPita."  A pita sandwich with yogurt dressing or something.)
<P>
The seductiveness of a futon in front of a TV should not be underestimated.  I realize now that since it's been built, the fiancee has made a habit of laying on it and finding something to watch, instead of having something to watch and laying down to be comfy while watching.  The upshot of this is that she's watching a lot more TV than normal.  Perhaps I need to remove some screws and pretend it's broken.  :\
<P>
I want to say something about Tilly, but I get the very real feeling he doesn't want any more discussed about it.  I also want to say something about the DMCA and the consequent SSSCA, but it's so damn depressing.</p>
