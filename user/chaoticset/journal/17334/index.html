<p>Progress -- writing the bits of the thing that will be using _calc_schema_value (the sub called _calc_schema) this morning went well.  Didn't finish, but it's a good start.
<p>
I'd have written more of that, but I ended up writing some subs I really should have had from the start -- a pretty-printer for the matrix object's main data structure, $matrix->{MATRIX}, and a couple of accessors I apparently forgot.  (Planning isn't my strong suit.  Can you tell?)   Instead of looking at Data::Dumper output (which is useful, don't get me wrong) I can actually look at something which visually matches what I'm scribbling on paper, and it's been a huge help.  Next time I need to write stuff like this right after writing the tiny, do-little-thing subs, and then I'll be ready to write the big stuff.
<p>
I did manage to burn a copy of Slack 8.0, so I've got something to work with until Slack 9.1 arrives in the mail.  (Thanks again, Mr. Muskrat!)  Now, I just need to get the chutzpah to actually back up all my data, wipe my drive, fix it (there's apparently a few problems in some of the last few sectors, something that's prevented me from defragmenting it <em>ever</em>) and partition the frickin' thing.
<p>
Right now, just from guesswork, I'm planning to cut the drive roughly in half for each OS, 30 gigs for each.  We'll see which side cries uncle first.  :)</p>
