<p>Well, it looks like all signs are go for the internship.  All I have to do now is call the school and actually figure some hours out; I'll probably want to come by the place and physically talk to them, mainly so I can suss the place and the people out while I'm there.  Never hurts to get familiar with your surroundings as early in the game as possible.
<P>
Tonight I check to see if my scheduling change got approved, and then I can set up hours for the internship, and then...then I'm working two jobs for the first time in my life.
<P>
Should be a trip.
<P>
I'm also going to have to ditch all the little wanderings I've been making around other languages (Ruby, Python, etc.) and focus on my Perl and VB (shudder!) and try to strengthen my network-fu.
<P>
Anyway, my journal will probably become hyperactive again shortly because of all this.  I'm planning to log stuff that happens on the job here if it's workable (I'm assuming that there's no reason that non-detailed information posted publicly would be a problem, but it could be, so I'm not sure it's okay) and that alone should provide lots of material at least one day out of the week.
<P>
It's good to be coming back.</p>
