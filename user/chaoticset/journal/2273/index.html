<p>...that is, I need to code more robustly.  All too often I find that what appeared to be lego-style construction was really a house of tiny cards, and placing one solid brick in one spot collapses several others.
<P>
Well, doesn't matter.  I installed the door-return spring, and it doesn't quite work.  (Well, to be fair, I couldn't quite install it properly due to metal door frames, but I did what I could.  I may give it another shot later.)
<P>
Spoke with the gentleman concerning the Sourceforge game; he said he'd be happy to entertain the notion of my help, but they're doing it in PHP.  At this point, I wouldn't care if it was being done in Swedish as long as there's a manual.
<P>
I just downloaded two versions of said manual; one that's a huge long HTML file (for starting to wade into it, so I don't have to find what I need in another file) and one that's broken into lots of small files (for later, when it's irritating to search through a whole long file for one thing).
<P>
Tomorrow is my first web class.  I'm hoping the instructor (whom I've never even <EM>seen</EM>) is both competent and not a language racist.  ("Perl?!  HA!  You call that a language?!")
<P>
The 220 instructor is the school's resident network guru; he comes from an electrical engineering background and focuses mostly on hardware.  Good deal, because I'm short on hardware familiarity.  I want to be able to field strip a Pentium by the end of the semester.  ;)
<P>
Oh, and the skin I rubbed raw around my eye has finally flaked off.  Thank Chao; I thought the itching would drive me sane.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Just had a quick talk with Kyle (project head, and the name of the project is Spehereal) and I get the feeling I need to go find out what CVS is.  (Don't they sell makeup and Tylenol?)

Wouldn't that be a "linguist"?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

That did pop into my head for a second when I was reading.
