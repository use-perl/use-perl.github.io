<p>Both on my post at the Monastery and from the program.
<P>
Everything was going peachy right up until I expected the cart to actually update properly; then, my expectations and reality diverged, as so often they've done before.  ;)
<P>
Well, it doesn't matter for now; tomorrow, if I get a few spare moments, I may fiddle with it.  My primary goals for tomorrow are only to Prep For School (because I may be going straight to class from my advisor meeting) and Get Some Sleep (because my advisor may be in as early as 9:00, and I want to get there as soon as usefully possible).  If I get some bugs fixed on top of all that, it will be Gravy.
<P>
I like Gravy quite a bit, actually.
<P>
This also reminds me that I should get a doctor's appointment as soon as I've got insurance again.  (Which will be soon, if I'm accepted for this coming semester.  It won't be quite so soon if I'm not.)
<P>
Ah, crap:  I forgot to sign up for VA benefits for this semester again!  Perhaps it's rollover (that is, just sign up for the year and it works all the way through) but I doubt it.
<P>
I'll probably take summer semester if I can hack that, too.  I may not be able to, though.</p>

Nope.  You've got to revalidate every term.

Ugh, lovely.  I'll be late again.
<p>
Good thing I'll be on campus Monday, then, I suppose.  I'll just grab the form and fill it out while I'm there.</p>
