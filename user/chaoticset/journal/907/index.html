<p>Really bizarre behavior from the last sub insert_cards.
<P>
See, I started commenting things out again.  (I don't know if that's acceptable or smart, but it helps me weed out a certain type of error.  The type where you forget something fairly easy to forget, like a right curly brace or a semicolon or something, and the next fifteen lines read in okay, and then there's an error.)  I just start commenting things until there's a few lines commented and everything else works okay, and then I go over the few lines.
<P>
Well, it works for now, anyway.
<P>
For some reason the *outer* foreach loop works.  Commented the whole inside out, slapped a print statement in, bango.  The cards are reading into the main foreach properly.
<P>
The thing that puzzles me are the *KIND* of errors I got for a while.  At one point, it would print the first card, then hang.  And sit.  And look at me.
<P>
I'd break out, fascinated.  Run it again.  Same deal.
<P>
There were several variations on this, and I can't think that somehow the arrays became infinitely long (wouldn't that crash the machine, anyway?) and I don't think that foreach somehow started tracking something else.
<P>
Weird.
<P>
(Okay, okay.  I know that at this point, if someone reads this, they're saying to themselves:  "He doesn't UNDERSTAND.  <insert technical explanation of problem>!"  Yup, you're right.  That's why I'm keeping the journal:  Entertainment of technically able programmers-uh, I mean, to learn from my mistakes.  Yeah.)
<P>
Anyway.  Just wanted to document this and move on.
<P>
(Oh, and I'll probably start deleting journal posts soon.  It would be a little embarrassing [not to mention I'd get in trouble with pudge] to look at the Top 10 and find out I have a few thousand journal entries.)
