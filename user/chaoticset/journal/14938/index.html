<p>I've just managed to install binaries of Subversion, and I'm planning to spend what little time I get over the weekend trying to learn about how to actually <EM>use</EM> it.
<P>
I have a sort of interview Tuesday.  Very strange situation.  It is web design, though, and my current job might even still be there after I start at this new place (assuming that I can cut my hours drastically at my current job, of course, and assuming further that I can get the new one as well).  I'll be working off the general sensation of good luck that always seems present when I tell other geek-types that I'm getting an interview, which is to say, I'm sure everybody who sees this or hears about it hopes it works out.
<P>
I want Subversion to work for a few reasons -- one, it'd kind of be nice to have the ability to keep track of versiony things, and two, other people use it.  (Those are really the only two reasons people use software, as far as I can tell.  "It'd be nice to keep track of this."  "Well, that guy's using it, so we should probably do that too."  They're the only ones I ever hear, anyway.)
<P>
Note to self:  Get involved with Phalanx, dammit...</p>

I like subversion in theory, I hate subversion for not working at all.

Please elaborate; I'd like to hear about other people's experiences with it.
<p>
The tiny little test I did -- checking out the currently mostly empty repository that chromatic set up for the XP training thingy -- worked, but I haven't attempted anything else yet.</p>

I finally got it compiled on AIX, only to find that none of the tests passed. I think alot of it has something to do with iconv, but I haven't really had the time to mess with it. Maybe I'll try again at some later date and version...
