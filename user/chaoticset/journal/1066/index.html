<p>That's what I'm giving the client as a delay period.  Two weeks.
<P>
In that time, I hope to have the order confirmation script working, the cart files handled, and the final kinks worked out of the stock-building tool.
<P>
I wish.
<P>
I've figured that the script that handles building the page of singles and matching to the stock file and all that can also drop any check-boxed cards into the cart file for that person, creating one for them if they don't have it already.
<P>
I tried setting it up just to open the file, and it loaded and loaded and loaded and never came up.
<P>

it moves right but it lies, yes<BR>
when will my page load?<BR>
<P>
I haven't written haiku in ages.  I miss it.
<P>
Perl reminded me of haiku when I started learning it.  Haikus felt irritatingly limiting when I learned them, back in HS; but after a while, it seemed there was a certain...dare I say it?  Elegance.  There was a certain elegance in the little structure.
<P>
Perl seems to have that. It has brevity without sacrificing nuance.
<P>
Okay.  'Nuff of that.  I have to make this work.
<P>
I will make this work.</p>
