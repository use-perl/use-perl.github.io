<p>It was pretty obvious why it was taking so long; I dumped the @show array out and found out my grep was matching everything.  I checked the regular expression, but it was clean; same one I'd used before.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
m/^$searchterm/
</BLOCKQUOTE>
was what I'm matching with.
<P>
The problem, then, was $searchterm.  Check check check, all the code revolving around $searchterm was straight from the original.  I'd hashed out all those little problems long ago, I'd thought.
<P>
Then I took a look at my sub fix().  Fix is supposed to return the searchterm with case changes so it'll match the database properly.  A few prints later, I realize fix is returning nothing, so the searchterm is nothing, so the grep matches every single stinkin' line.
<P>
The page loads in under a second now, quick and pretty.  Everything's laid out where it should be.
<P>
I decided on a name for this mess (I always tried to avoid calling it anything before), the GUICE.  Greg's Unique-Item Commerce Engine.  Pronounced like 'grease', if it were spelt 'gwease'.  If I ever get smart, I may even be able to make it workable.  I doubt anybody except game shops will ever need it, though:  Most situations where you deal with unique items for sale that I can think of (diamonds, artwork), the thing is so valuable that you can afford to negotiate each sale individually.  Magic cards are *not*.  (The tentative lowest sale price for anything we're going to sell is a dollar, and the highest is still under US$300.00, so the situation is fairly unique to cheaper collectibles.)
<P>
If it's ever released in some fashion, it will SPECIFICALLY state that NO ONE may EVER sell Beanie Babies with it, under penalty of loss of all assets to me.
<P>
As if I'm ever going to get it that clean or that well-made.  *shrug*  Oh well.  I guess I'll find out...</p>
