<p>I've been theoretically Perling (that is, doing it in my head, trying to write snippets of code to keep my brain in practice, reading the Camel some more, etc.) but have been unable to actually force code from my fingers for perhaps two days now.
<P>
Probably just a little dry spell.
<P>
In other news, I found an <A HREF="http://www.greatmindsworking.com/">A.I.-oriented place</A> and registered.  I won't have a lot to contribute, but it'll be fun reading, I hope.
<P>
In other news, I have hesitantly made my first <A HREF="http://use.perl.org/user/CliffY/">foe</A>, but I get the feeling CliffY is looking for enemies anyway.</p>

I've thought about making him a foe, only after his most recent <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=5005" title="perl.org">reply</a perl.org> to one of my entries though.<br> <br>I am speculating that he would reply to each of my entries in a trollish way. I suppose I should make one tonight to see what happens.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>I'm rather thick skinned so this stuff almost never bothers me. We'll see if Cliffy is up to the challenge (doubt it).

Well, I debated about it.  He's clearly one of those scared little halfwits, the kind who heckle comedians because they themselves would piss their shorts in front of an actual crowd.  Desperate for attention...probably insecure about themselves in several ways.
<p>
Even so, I don't like having made my first foe here, mainly because this has been such a friendly place.  Hopefully he'll either shut up and learn or just shut up.</p>
