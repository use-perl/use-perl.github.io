<p>The myriad thoughts slouching through my mind like college students shuffling around inside a dorm lounge will, like those students, occasionally take off, late for something, suddenly inspired, etc.  My obsession is temporary but occasionally fruitful.
<p>
I sense one coming on for the IF project that's been in the corner, pretending to itself that it's studying but actually staring off into space, waiting for some right moment for action.  I get the feeling it's about to get a jolt.
<p>
Nicely enough, this happens when a lasting quote is in current memory:
<blockquote>
...it's a question of congruence: precision and flexibility may be just as dysfunctional in novel, uncertain situations as sloppiness and vacillation are in familiar, well-defined ones. Those who admire the massive, rigid bone structures of dinosaurs should remember that jellyfish still enjoy their very secure ecological niche.</blockquote>
I know why I haven't been able to work on the IF game I want to write -- I've been going at it the wrong way.  I need a foundation in place, a codebase and a general design, and then I need to write the stuff that's going to make it shine.  The code's straightforward.  It can't really be screwed up.  There's pretty much a finite set of right ways to do it.
<p>
No new ground must be broken for this endeavor, and I keep banging around with shovels.
<p>
I'm going to take a little time off my hyper-webbiness...check my regular haunts twice a day and no more, say...and work on this framework I need.  I doubt seriously that a lot of original code will need writing -- more like a lot of design will need to be done first, and then a bit of code, and then the sit-down-and-sweat-blood writing starts.
<p>
I am so ready for some of that.
