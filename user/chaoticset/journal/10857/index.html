<p>Not that the net has missed the contribution, but I have essentially left off logging entries here.  Certainly, this has to do with my rather extreme personal business.
<P>
On the up side, though -- I've started coding again, and it feels very, very good to come home.  :)  I'm building a Perl/Tk GUI for writing POD into my Perl code (I'm sure this is notably insane/indefensible/pointless/etc., but all the same, I'm a simple person -- I know how to build a simple GUI, I want something a little visual for writing the POD, etc.) and I'm starting to get the hang of it again.
<P>
I've started keeping archives of _The Perl Review_ local and handy so that I can load one up whenever I want to, say, go over the Iterator design in Perl again.  It's handy and entertaining, but I wonder when they're going to have zipped volumes available.  (Probably as soon as they read this.  ;)  )
<P>
Also, I'm looking into Mutt as a mail client.  Heard good things, especially about the crypto support, but I want to research it more before I make the leap.  There's a port to Win32 on Sourceforge, and there's always cygwin, but one of the systems at home doesn't have a working cygwin installation (yet another thing I need to fix someday).  I want to have this accessible on the tiny LAN at home, completely unified, and stop screwing around with all these different mail thingydingys.
<P>
More things have occurred to me recently concerning code, but I've been meaning to start writing regularly in here again anyway.</p>
