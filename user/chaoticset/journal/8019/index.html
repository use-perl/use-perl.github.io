<p>Asked Les if taking photos around the school would be okay.  (I have to do a presentation after the internship is over, so I want to get visuals as soon as possible.  If I start working on the presentation now, by the time the internship is over, it'll actually look professional.)  He said yes, so now I have to remember to bring my cam sometime.
<P>
Les looked at me while we were watching Service Pack 3 install and said, "So Perl's just a scripting language, right?"  He doesn't know yet, but I will do my best to be an ambassador of Perly goodness and convince Les that -- especially since OS X has Perl already installed -- Perl's his best bet for automating tasks, and VB should be used sparingly.
<P>
I kid, partly.  I don't have a lot against VB, it's just bulky and intensely repetitive in some simple things.  It does make GUI design lightning fast, but at the cost of real familiarity with the elements of the design, which is a loss in the long run.
<P>
Gotta bring the cam, gotta bring the Llama (I told Les I'd loan him a copy since I have 2nd and 3rd editions) and gotta let him know I can't be around tomorrow.
<P>
I also have to email my professor and let him know that I'm actually in his class.  I was supposed to do that the first week of class.  Crap.</p>
