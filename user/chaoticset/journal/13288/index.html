<div class="span8">
<p>Working on installing POE, mainly because I can't solve my current programming problems and I can't think of anything nifty to attempt.  I want to <EM>do</EM> something.  Desperately.
<P>
Reading through some of the FM, I come across warnings about ActiveState's PPD for POE, indicating that ActiveState's copy is *ahem* two years old.
<P>
Why?!
<P>
Not that this is going to put any crimp in my style -- I was planning to, as they say, "1n5t4ll 0ldsk00l" and make it -- but why would AS keep something around for two years?
<P>
Is this some bizarre comedy of manners, where POE doesn't want to bother AS, and AS doesn't know any better, and (figuratively) AS keeps spooning peas into their handbag, or whatever this would figuratively be in a comedy of errors, for two straight years?
<P>
If it's a joke, it's an old one.  I wonder how inaccessible AS must be if this is the case -- POE shows no signs of inactivity.
<P>
Regardless, I'll be farting around with POE for a bit.  Please, excuse the vinegar -- I'm not really upset, I just fail to see any reason that something like that should be <EM>two years</EM> old.</p>

<h2>ActiveState POE PPM out of date?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dngor/">dngor</a> on 2003-07-06T20:09:36</h3>
<p>You can try downloading it.  Either it's two years or just three months out of date, depending on which part of <a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Modules/Perl/dist_html?dist_id=9413" title="activestate.com">ASPN's entry for POE</a activestate.com> you believe.</p>

<p>The issue has been submitted to ActiveState at least three times over the past couple years.  We've officially given up on it and begun releasing our own PPDs.  See <a href="http://poe.perl.org/?Where_to_Get_POE" title="perl.org">"Where to Get POE"</a perl.org>.

It seems that the Linux version fails the automated build process: <a href="http://ppm.activestate.com/BuildStatus/5.8-linux/linux-5.8/POE-0.26.txt" title="activestate.com">build status</a activestate.com>.  The other platforms seem to be <a href="http://ppm.activestate.com/BuildStatus/5.8-P.html" title="activestate.com">up-to-date</a activestate.com>.  Send me email after OSCON and I'll check what is going on.

Would it be a daft idea to suggest you get in touch with module authors whose modules are failing builds?

No, it is not.  But for now I'm not sure if the automated build process doesn't need more work before we start spamming the authors with build failures.

<p>The problem, as usual, is the tuits to improve this situation.  But it looks like we get approval to hire more people for the Camel pit (they tend to get stolen by the other teams).

</p><p>I <em>am</em> trying to improve the situation (the automated build process was broken for almost 9 month and was fixed just 3 months ago), but progress has been slower than anticipated (see above).

</p><p>As I said earlier, email me after OSCON, and I'll try to get things fixed "manually" for the more popular modules.  But in general I want the automated process improved, as we just don't have the resources to continue building things manually.

</p><p>You can also send email to the ppm@listserv.ActiveState.com mailing list, although you must be a subscriber to get the post through.</p>

<p>Thanks for looking at it, especially while you're away from the office.  The failure reads:</p>
<p>couldn't connect to display "gimlet:10.0" at<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... line<nobr> <wbr></nobr>....</p>
<p>It looks like you have a DISPLAY environment variable set without a valid, reachable X server.  The test normally will skip if you don't have DISPLAY set.  I'll treat the condition as a reason to skip the Tk tests in future versions of POE, and I'll e-mail suggestions to you on Friday.</p>

<h2>Should be all good now</h2>

Both the 5.6 and 5.8 repositories should have the current POE release now.
