<p>Color scheme I tossed down in the CSS for the final project site today.  I'll probably abandon it altogether within a week, just getting sick of it, but at least I only have to rewrite part of the CSS instead of the whole damn thing.  The joys of compartmentalization.  :)
<P>
I'm considering pulling one of my classmates in 232 aside and asking for a few quick side lessons in CSS-building, since I'm botch awful at it, and don't get the advanced stuff like DIV and whatnot.  (This would be the classmate who is a faculty member.  At my school, this is something of a novelty -- a faculty member attending one of the classes in the department they teach in -- but I couldn't think of any good reason the teachers at my school shouldn't be learning new things.  Is this unique?)
<P>
I ended up withdrawing from an introductory Java class some time back; I still have the textbook.  When I've had enough of the project for a few hours, I plan to start working through the intro examples in the book and familiarizing myself with Java syntax.  (I realize now that the entire barrier to my understanding anything in Java was my non-understanding of OO principles.  Now that I have a passing grasp of them, I think Java may be surmountable.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Is surmountable a word?  I can't remember it being used, but 'surmount' feels like a word for some reason.  Damn.  Should check this.

<h2>Professors in classes</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-06-19T18:09:08</h3>
<p>I impressed my networking professor ("Ziggy", but not the ziggy of use Perl;) so much with <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyhttpd/" title="sourceforge.net">this webserver</a sourceforge.net> that when he learned we would be taking compilers together the next semester, he asked me to be on his team along with another professor.  Neither one had a doctorate [yet], but they were both smart and qualified lecturers.  Ironically, Ziggy got a spectacular job offer during the semester and left the class, while <a href="http://ranger.uta.edu/user/kearny/" title="uta.edu">our other partner</a uta.edu> and I finished up (thanks to Ziggy's head start on the lexer).</p>



<h2>Java and OO</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-06-19T18:11:36</h3>
<p>Did you, like me, learn OO first from Perl?  I thought OO was a buzzword until Perl convinced me otherwise.  I didn't learn C++ until my second AI class, and learned Java on my own because I thought it would be useful.  Both of these were long after I had a firm grasp of OO and was using it routinely in Perl.</p>

Well, if you watch Kids In The Hall, you might remember a sketch about a guy who understood no English, but could speak several hundred sentences by rote.  This meant that, when someone came in and asked him a question, he responded that he didn't understand what they were asking, or what he was saying, even though it was in perfect English.
<p>
Similarly, I coded for a short time in Inform, Graham Nelson's language for writing interactive fiction.  Inform is object-oriented, and I wrote working code, but I didn't understand a damn thing about it.  My understanding was related to the results, not the actual code; essentially I was cut-n-pasting with my brain.  (It got me through a few prototype games, so it was effective to some degree.)
</p><p>
Maybe two years after that, I bailed on the Java class.  One year after bailing, I started this journal, and you can see when I started picking it up.
</p><p>
I did get a basic "understanding" of the concepts from my Intro To Programming, but zero actual implementation.
</p><p>
So, um, sort of.  I grokked it (hopefully) in Perl.  I learned it in 210.  I 'roted' it in Inform.  (I'm worried now that I'll start working in Inform a few years down the road and use -&gt; all the time.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:\  Oh well...)</p>
