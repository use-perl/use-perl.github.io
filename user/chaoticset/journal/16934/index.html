<p><BLOCKQUOTE>While I realize the game would look horrible without the required things that the other cards do, why on earth wouldn't you let the purchaser of the software decide whether they want the game to look bad and run as opposed to look good on someone else's computer?
<P>
I bought this for myself for christmas.  I've never had to worry about specs on ANYTHING, because *the specs are for people who care about it looking nice*.  Seriously.  I don't check specs, and I've never had a problem with any game except PoP:SoT.
<P>
Every other game I've played has ALWAYS given me the option of turning virtually every decent feature off, so I can *play the game*.  BG&E did that.  You guys made that.  Who decided PoP shouldn't work on my machine?
<P>
And why are they still working there?
<P>
And why haven't you released a patch yet?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Honestly, this is infuriating, and it feels irritatingly personal, as if the designer of a line of clothes issued guidelines about not allowing ugly people to purchase their clothing.  While I realize it says right on the box that it won't work, specs have <EM>never</EM> caused a problem before, not with anything.  Slowdown is sometimes apparently, but I can <EM>play</EM> a slow game.  I can even play a game that doesn't look as good as the designers intended.  This just seems to be a very "we're taking our ball and we're going home" kind of thing, trivial and childish.
<P>
And yet...I still beg these same people to put out a patch so I can play it...</p>
