<p>The argument in my head is running along the lines of
<P>
"You should re-write almost the WHOLE script.  In fact, I'm thinking you should break it into three scripts for the sake of readability."
<P>
versus
<P>
"The script isn't great, but it's not totally shitcan terrible either.  Work on it and it'll serve well."
<P>
Now, realistically, the first voice is righter than the second.  (I didn't know what grep did a week ago.  Go ahead, laugh all you want.  I know where you live.)  But, because I try to make correct decisions instead of fast ones, I'll compromise.  I'll start my vacation early, get all my backups made at a leisurely pace (instead of all of them Thursday!) and prep the stuff for the rp'ing campaign.
<P>
Oh, right, I didn't mention that.  The client (in a non-client role) has confided in me that several of our mutual acquaintances are hurtin' for rp'ing, so would I please GM?
<P>
I pretended to hold out.  I love rp'ing, and I haven't in at least the three months I've been working on this.  Maybe longer.  :\  I'm not sure.
<P>
Of course, because the allure of this language just seems neverending to me, I'll rig up a linux distribution on my 486 in the living room.  If I feel like coding on the script, I can - I just won't be able to test the same way.  If I feel like playing with the language a bunch, I can do that too.  (I can also access a bunch of stuff through my Zip drive, handy little bastard that it is.)
<P>
I can make a bunch of handling routines, stuff that wouldn't even touch the HTML, and see if everything's updating properly.  Then, when the big bad box gets back, I can clean things up, fix things, properly test things, etc.
<P>
Glad it's under warranty, though.  :\
<P>
What else...Buffy!  I probably wouldn't be so mad at it if I could figure out WHY it nags me on the periphery of my mind so much, or why I can't seem to stop *watching* it.  :(
<P>
I'm playing around with PerlMUD and I'm playing around with Perl.  I tried to write a filter today, but I lost a finger in the process so I quit playing with it for now.  Probably fix it later this week.</p>

<b>&lt;NOSTALGIA&gt;</b> <br>
The good ol' days - it was the bane of my college existence back in the day - the reason it took me more than the std. 4 years to complete my degree.
<p>
But it was so fun - I loved coding levels - I put a lot of sweat into one mud called PyroMUD, where I was also an admin.  Then it completely disappeared in a server crash.
</p><p>
I wish they had PerlMUD back then<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... that would be fun to develop/code against!<br>

Now now, Purdy, Pyromud never disappeared.  We just started using invisible code.<br/><br/>Actually, it exists on a little gold CD that I rarely think about, and I have a bunch of college students (formerly 14 and 15 year olds from New Mexico [Kyp, Fishperson, Quasar, etc]) constantly emailing me, asking me to put it on a server somewhere so they can waste THEIR college years reviving the project.<br/><br/>Poor kiddies.  Maybe one day I'll get around to sending it to them and ruining their lives<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:P<br/><br/>--Jason [aka Nightmare/Pyromud]

<h2>Rewriting is Rarely a Solution</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2001-11-28T06:13:56</h3>
For what it's worth, I recommend refactoring.
<p>
Throwing away something that mostly works is a good way to get to write all of the easy stuff and all of the fixed bugs all over again, while making new mistakes.
</p><p>
Think of it like revising an article or a book chapter.  Unless Pudge comes down on you super hard, you're better off rephrasing things, moving paragraphs around, and adding more jokey footnotes than scrapping everything and starting over.
</p><p>
(Of course, if Pudge <strong>does</strong> say "That's completely wrong.  You should delete all copies, grind that hard drive into dust, and set it on fire before I kick your ***!", then you should start over.  I think that's completely out of his system, though.)
</p><p>
Seriously, learning the discipline of <em>improving</em> something that is ugly but mostly working will serve you very well.  You might even get a job refactoring part of the Perl core library.  Yikes.</p>

I was rooting through the code earlier today in my discrete math class and I came to a similar conclusion:  "Most of this works.  I just need to fix some of the way I'm building my data structures and then add new stuff."  This clinches it for me.
<p>
It always feels better when I decide what I'm doing so I can get to the doing of it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
