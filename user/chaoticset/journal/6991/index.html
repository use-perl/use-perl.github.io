<div class="span8">
<p>That's how I've come to view Borders these days.
<P>
I'm not here to wax nostalgic about my book-consumption record of late, I'm here to throw wonky speculation together.
<P>
It has occurred to me recently that Perl has a mutability that other languages, say C++, lack.  This is because Perl (and your Pythons and Rubys and whatnot) are based on either linguistics (like Perl) or Perl (like Ruby).  Language has been mutable, over the millenia; math less so.  It makes sense that something based on calculus cannot truly be given an overhaul; calculus cannot be overhauled!
<P>
The argument goes back and forth; C++/Java/whatever this this this, Perl/Python/whatever that that that.  It's irrelevant.  The resounding cry of "Use The Best Tool For The Job!" is lost on people <EM>who do not realize there's more than one type of job</EM>.  They're arguing that C is algebraically complete, or they're arguing that Perl is more compact.
<P>
Would I ever have a conversation in mathematical symbols?  Not unless it was for the sake of a joke.  Would I ever attempt to communicate deep mathematics without the lovely shorthand provided by mathematical symbols?  Not unless it was for the sake of a joke.  (I'd do almost anything for the sake of a joke.)  The point is that some languages are more comfortable for different things, and it has nothing at all to do with <EM>good</EM> or <EM>bad</EM> or <EM>ugly</EM>.  It has to do with <STRONG>useful</STRONG>.  Useful trumps everything else.
<P>
Regardless of these things, mathematically-based languages will probably always play the card of Running Fast, and linguistically-based languages will probably always play the cards of Easier, Faster, More Portable.  The only problem for math-languages is that Running Fast doesn't matter if you're not in a race.  It isn't going to be such a big deal as the years go by; speed becomes irrelevant after a certain point.  Eventually, Running Fast just won't be enough.
<P>
The other problem is that math-languages <EM>seem</EM> to push people to closed viewpoints.  Note the Inline::* modules.  Note that no such thing exists for, say, Java.  (Well, sure, there are a few efforts -- but Perl's got the monopoly right now, AFAIK.)  If speed becomes a true non-issue, and Perl can parse C, who needs C?  Any old things can be wrapped into "inlined C" Perl scripts.
<P>
I didn't have a point, sorry.  I've just been having this thought since earlier in the day, when I was scanning _Code Complete_ at Borders, and I wanted to get it recorded somewhere.</p>
