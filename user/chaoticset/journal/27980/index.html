<p>I have more interesting classes written and some ideas kicking around for what to do with the resulting framework.
<p>
In discussing it with my mentor at school and a few other folks, I've heard suggestions that the framework and the application I'm building from it might actually serve as the useful core of my portfolio -- or, gasp, possibly a useful item for <em>other people</em>.
<p>
Whether that last magical possibility can come true remains to be seen.  The work I'm doing on MaLToL right now is so scattershot (because my work schedule is currently 40+ hours a week and my presentations are happening this week) that I don't feel comfortable evaluating it in such a fashion.  Next week will be more relaxed -- or at least involve less driving.  :\
<p>
Still, it's good to know that I still understand Perl.  I'd been worried, with the long time I'd had away from code, that I had somehow forgotten.  It's like Splinter Cell -- I haven't played it in years, and the contrast between it and another game (say, Fable) is jarring -- but the old motion was so smooth and practiced that I fall into the groove readily.
<p>
Indeed, the groove of Perl is possessed of great funk.  :D</p>
