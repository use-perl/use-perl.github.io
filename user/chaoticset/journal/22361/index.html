<p>I needed a templating solution for this credit card thing, and I didn't want to use HTML::Template (my memory seems to indicate that it had a few dependencies), but I could distinctly remember having good experiences with Text::Template in the past, and it doesn't have any dependencies at all.
<p>
So I installed Text::Template locally within my space, only to find out that I never actually <em>used</em> Text::Template at any point in the past.  All my memories, well...they weren't about HTML::Template, I know that.  I have plenty of memories about HTML::Template, but this was something else.  I never got Mason working properly, and I can't remember any other templating solutions that I looked at seriously, so I'm kind of at a loss for what, exactly, my memory has dredged up.
<p>
I decided to stick with Text::Template anyway, seeing as how it was already installed.  Of course, it's been pretty clear sailing -- I won't go so far as to use the dreaded term <em>intuitive</em>, because nothing is truly intuitive -- but there's nothing difficult about Text::Template.</p>

<p>
You might consider giving <tt>HTML::Template</tt> another look. The overt depencies are minimal (<tt>File::Spec</tt> being the most unusual thing it uses by default). Other dependencies are triggered by explicit use of features like caching, which cause attempts to <tt>require</tt> things like <tt>IPC::SharedCache</tt>. Even <tt>Digest::MD5</tt> is optional.

I may well end up doing that.  I was under the impression that it required something nonstandard, somehow.
