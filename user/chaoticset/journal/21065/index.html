<p>I have advised my father that I am of the opinion that there may be another country out there somewhere that might suit me better than the United States these days.
<p>
I'm not saying that I'm literally incapable of living here -- I can live under almost any conditions if I must -- but I'm starting to wonder if I might find some other place more hospitable.
<p>
Towards this end, my father suggested I find a place and he'd try to help me take a short trip there -- just to get a feel for the place.  I'm not sure if this is an attempt on his part to get me to be more extroverted or what, but I think I'll probably take him up on the offer after I research likely nations.</p>

I am speaking from a lot of experience here<br> <br>It doesn't matter what the significant changes is<br>A new relationship<br>A new job<br>A new location<br>A new hobby<br> <br>They will all seem like the answer to your problem in the short term.  In fact, psychologically they can even be a temporary cure for situational depression.  The trouble begins when the newness wears off.<br> <br>I am not saying not to visit another country or even not to move there.  What I am saying is that you need to force yourself into the frame of mind of how will you feel about the place when the honeymoon is over.<br> <br>The little things we think we can overlook because of how happy something makes us will be the same things we are complaining about a year from now.<br> <br>Good luck in any decision you make - even if that is to move to sunny Arizona<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
