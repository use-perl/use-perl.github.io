<p>I want to use perl, but I can't bring myself to fiddle with that wretched script somehow.
<P>
Enter A Stupid Idea.
<P>
Now, I'm sure no one reading this will be surprised to find that I don't have a lot of friends at this point in time.  I have serious trouble socially interacting due to A:  Unemployment (no money to socialize with) and B: I dislike pointless socializing.
<P>
The problem with this is, where some people have a small cabal of friends they generally hang out with, I do not.  And where I did, I can't see them regularly anymore.  (My best friend having gone to jail and my other friends having mostly vanished.)
<P>
What's that got to do with perl?
<P>
Glad you asked!  In a fit of utter derangement, I'm writing a script to help me remember to keep up correspondences, call people, etc.  That way my crapped-out memory won't prevent me from at least attempting to engage in social behavior.
<P>
Kind of like an appointment book that writes itself for you.
<P>
(Really, it's not so pathetic as to be laughable!  Please don't call the police!)
<P>
Okay, it's really just an excuse to get used to dbmopen() and dbmclose().  But if it works like planned, it was a brilliant idea the whole time.  :D
<P>
Also, ideally I'd like it to be able to suggest activities for me to suggest to said other people.  I know, I'm getting ahead of myself here -- if I keep coming up with ideas for things it could do I'll never write the thing to begin with -- but this is in an ideal situation.
<P>
I have a little (very little!) code written.  I'll keep tabs in here on what comes up, what's not working, and what went where.
<P>
Oh, and I'm going to try using the <A HREF="http://www.twoshortplanks.com/xmas/about10.html">module</A> I read about in the Perl Advent Calendar.  Since I really don't have the faintest clue what I'm doing, it should be interesting to see if it works.  :)</p>
