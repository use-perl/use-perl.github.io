<div class="span8">
<p>The combination of urging by Reabena and a gift card to Borders resulted in my purchase last night of _Embedding Perl in HTML with Mason_.
<P>
Interestingly, I've just realized that I can use bookmarks at the <EM>site</EM> to refer to places in the book, and keep the book free of bookmarks/constant travel/etc., thereby ensuring the value of my investment, as it were.
<P>
That plus the other tangibles mentioned at the site as to why the book's worth the money -- can't curl up by the fireplace with an LCD.  (Well, you can, but it's not cozy.)  Books aren't subject to power failures, etc.
<P>
I'm planning to actually build a Mason site, if I can swing it somewheres.  I need to find out if either of my free hosting locations currently has Mason and mod_perl installed, so I need to figure out a way to test it without bugging the admins, if possible.</p>

If you can't get it for free, you might want to check out <a href="http://www.johncompanies.com/" title="johncompanies.com">johncompanies.com</a johncompanies.com>. They have a special for OS contributors where you can get one of their virtual servers for $45 instead of $55/65. It's pretty nifty - I have root and can do as I please within reason. The downside is that it was a bare install in that I had to make use of the ports system to install some basic programs to make the system usable (like emacs<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-). But I've learned more about FreeBSD and that is good.
