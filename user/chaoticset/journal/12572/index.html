<p>I got shanghaied into taking a trip to another part of Maine to see Reabena's parents this weekend.  Due to her father's parents running a flea market, I walked away from the weekend with a small box of middle-aged science fiction.  The only name I remember is Zelazny, but I read _Psycho Shop_ and was rather impressed with both authors afterwards.
<P>
_Psycho Shop_ is an interesting exercise in authoring.  Alfred Bester wrote roughly half and then -- the epitome of rudeness! -- he <EM>died</EM>.
<P>
The publishers tapped another author, the much younger (then) Roger Zelazny, to finish the book.  I think Zelazny knew that there would be an inevitable stylistic change, so he manufactured a reason for it (the viewpoint character gradually regains more of his memory and has increasingly surreal experiences) and then made it as prominent as possible by the end of the novel.
<P>
Very readable.  Probably neither author's best work, but that doesn't make it less enjoyable.
<P>
If I'm lucky, it looks like I might get to collaborate soon with another Perl programmer, which would be a new and interesting experience -- and is therefore desirable.  :)</p>
