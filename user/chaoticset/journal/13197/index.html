<p>...I just googled myself a doc which doesn't appear to be one that the author wants accessible.  I found a copy of gnat's slides for Introduction to mod_perl that doesn't seem to be accessible from the outside (i.e., moving up the URLs reveals it's not accessible from there, though it may be from somewhere else, I haven't googled for links to it yet.)  I've been reading through it, but now I wonder if I'm violating some implicit contract I have with the author <EM>not</EM> to read only authorized things.
<P>
I always wonder about this.  Every so often I'll accidentally google out a copy of the Perl Bookshelf online somewhere, usually someone's utility copy so that they can access it remotely.  I own a copy of Perl Bookshelf 2, one that I purchased -- does that mean I can look at theirs, too?  Or am I somehow encouraging further copyright violations?  :(
<P>
Usually I cower from these weighty (legal|philosophical) issues and find myself at perldoc.com, huddling between the tutorials and trying to forget the horror that modern copyright is.
<P>
This is all apparently an introduction to a short list of things I'm wantin' to learn about lately.
<UL>
<LI>mod_perl
<LI>network programming with Perl
<LI>threads and using them
</UL>
And concerning the second one, I'm always looking for Lincoln Stein's book of that name, but my local Borders doesn't carry it.  Oh, they carry the Java Cookbook, and they carry Learning Python, but apparently 'Network Programming With Perl' just isn't sexy enough for them.
<P>
Please, excuse the bitterness.  I'll just special-order it one of these days soon.
<P>
Also -- though it's directly related -- I wanted to relate how <EM>ecstatic</EM> I am that my current SO is also a programmer to some degree.  (And, should my previous SO be reading this...I'm not expressing disgust or something about you, just finding a happy common ground with someone else about something else.)  Actually <EM>pointed at a book on the shelf and said,</EM> "I want to get that someday soon."
<P>
It was Learning Java, but I can excuse that.</p>

Congratulations!<br>
I met my wife while we were both working on our <b>BSEE</b>s.<br>It really makes it easier to talk when you have a common background and interest.<br>
She doesn't care that much about programming, but at least she can understand what I am talking about when I need to talk something out.<br>

<h2>mod_perl slides</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gnat/">gnat</a> on 2003-07-02T16:01:17</h3>
The URL for the mod_perl tutorial slides was posted to the mod_perl mailing list, so it's public.  And it's linked-to from <a href="http://perl.apache.org/docs/offsite/presentations.html" title="apache.org">the mod_perl presentations page</a apache.org>.  Don't get too caught up in the slides, though--they're very old and you'd be much better off with a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0672322404" title="amazon.com">mod_perl Developer's Cookbook</a amazon.com> and <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pmodperl" title="oreilly.com">Practical mod_perl</a oreilly.com>.<p>

When I posted them, I really hoped someone else would be interested in taking them and maintaining them as a free resource.  The easier it is for people to teach others about mod_perl, the more mod_perl will be used.  It didn't happen<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(</p><p>

Aha...thank you.  I have <em>seen</em> both of those on the shelves, but have not taken five minutes yet to scan either one.  Which is a better start -- Practical, or Cookbook?
<p>
Or does that depend on how much hand-holding I'll need?</p>

It's honestly hard to say--I think Practical covers more (administration, installation) in more depth, but in terms of getting your act together fast with mod_perl programming, the Cookbook is supergood at that.<p>

Honestly, buy 'em both<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>
