<p>Okay, that's officially it.  I am calling the doctor's office tomorrow, crying into the phone, and banging on the door.  This <EM>irritates the fuck out of me</EM>, and not many things achieve that.
<P>
It doesn't help that I can't see very well, but have several fairly important things to note.
<P>
First, I got all the functionality back in the GUICS script.  (Lucky me.)  Then I backed the code the hell up, because I managed to delete important things I couldn't see that I'd highlighted several times earlier.  I'm fairly close to getting the cart-removal thing working.  Then it's security (a session id consisting of random numbers, ip address, date and time, a prevention mechanism for accessing things after they're an hour old, a cleanup mechanism to return old cart-stuff to the shelves...) and testing time.
<P>
Second, I spoke with someone on Sourceforge about joining them in a project.  Last time I did this I had to bow out for personal problems, and I'm still kicking myself over it, because the project looked <EM>so</EM> cool.
<P>
Third, I'm going shopping as soon as I get offlin and get a shower.  I'm buying groceries and bandage-style eyepatches, so my eye won't keep drying up.  I can't wait to cook without having to rub at my eye every forty seconds.
<P>
This thing is so raw and so awful that I keep having images of cutting it out flash to mind.  That bothers me.</p>
