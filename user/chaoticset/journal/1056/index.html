<p>Sounds like three of the Major Arcana from some bizarre tarot deck, don't they?
<P>
I didn't get much done the past two days because my father is in town from Kentucky.  Usually, he's only up two or three times a year, so I try to see him when he's here.
<P>
I realize it may have slowed me down on the project, but I couldn't refuse it.  No college student can pass up a free meal.  ;)
<P>
The program is currently doing every thing I've asked it to do properly - now, the fun part:  Asking for more.
<P>
Right now, when you go to the singles page, it gives you the little message to fill in a search term.  If you hit search and there's no term, it gives you the message again.  If you have a term in there when you hit search, all the cards with those first few letters come up.  If it doesn't match, you get "No Cards Matched."  I made the search term case-insensitive, because case is never relevant in this set.
<P>
I have the search tool workin' all fine and dandy.
<P>
Time to build the cart functions.
<P>
There's already a little checkbox and a text box (check to indicate they want some, textbox to indicate how many, defaults to 1) and I just have to make sure the tags are getting set right for those.
<P>
Then, before the check for the search term, it will check if any of the checkboxes were checked; if they are, it adds those items to the cart, then continues with the search.
<P>
This way, if someone wants several cards that have different names, they can get them in their cart with a minimum of page-viewing and page-loading.  To view their cart, there's a 'View Cart' button on every stinkin' page in the place that accesses the cart viewer.
<P>
I ended up reading some of the book <B>Programming Python</B> at Borders waiting for my father this morning, and I suspect I'll be picking it up this year for christmas.  I am fully aware that there is an apparent rivalry between the Python and Perl camps.
<P>
I am also fully aware that I have never let rivalries stand in the way of my knowledge set before, so I honestly don't give a shit.  Python looks interesting, so I'm going to learn it - just like I'm going to give learning LISP a shot, too.
<P>
Just because.
<P>
It'll have to wait, though, until this thing is off the ground and running at a decent pace.  Of course.</p>
