<P>
Not the board game type, either.
<P>
I've lacked true, gainful employment for the past seven months or so (maybe longer, I don't really want to go check right now).  Part of the reason for this has been that I can skate on the VA money I get for being in school.
<P>
Over the summer, however, I won't be taking a full classload and will probably not get as much money.  I need to get a job over the summer -- and if I can't get a job hacking something, I'll have to go ask for a job at what's left of envisionEt or Subway.
<P>
Even if I can get a job coding something, there's no guarantee that I'll be able to put it on a resume.  Some of the leads I have point to porn-style jobs.
<P>
To be truthful, I'm not entirely sure I'm ready for this kind of work yet.  I wasn't sure I could swim when I first went, but I did; I wasn't sure I could drive when I first tried, and I couldn't.
<P>
I guess I'll find out.
<P>
<EM>Any</EM> advice -- about what I can do, how best to look, how best to present myself, how best to dress or talk or <EM>anything</EM> -- will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Emphasize your ability to learn things.  We've all watched you here and know that's one of your strong points.  No job requires the exact skillset any new hire has.  Let them know that you will be up and running rapidly with whatever they need you to know, and that you'll do a better job picking it up than anyone else.</p>
<p>For a more long-term job, emphasize the fact that you are always learning new things and improving yourself.</p>

I never know how to respond to a compliment, so I'll just say, 'Thank You'.
<p>
I do want to ask:  Do you mean emphasize it during the interview, on the resume, or both?  On the resume, would this be listing self-taught languages/protocols/libraries?</p>

<p>Emphasize it on both, but particularly during the interview.  Mentioning things you've self-taught yourself on the resume sounds like a good idea.  Remember, though, that the resume should be concise.  Conventional wisdom says never go over one page.</p>
