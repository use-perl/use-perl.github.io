<p>I figure by around 2 PM my brain will go to sleep and my body will keep running around, due to the massive amounts of ginseng, ginkgo, eyebright, Drano and Chao knows what else I have ingested this morning trying to get my motor started.
<P>
Started.  Revving.  And by this afternoon, the driver will nod off and the nitro will fire.  The results of today are totally unguessable; I'm expecting lawsuits, myself.  :)
<P>
I cannot possibly afford to miss my classes today, yet my car is playing this evil-Bond-villain game with me where it <EM>starts</EM>, and I rev it a little, and then when I shift into drive and tap the gas, it dies.
<P>
I have taken to beating on the steering wheel, but <EM>what more can one human do</EM>?
<P>
My professor for the morning class has been kind enough to email me the take-home test and explain today's curricula -- mostly just overview of relational database stuff -- so I won't be laggin' behind next week.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Curricula'?  Isn't curriculum a singular?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
I have a crazy plan to dump a container of "drygas", which as far as I can remember is just wood alcohol, into the half-full gas tank, hoping that somehow that will spur the beast into true action and not these limping half-starts.</p>

<h2>curricula is plural</h2>

Do you have several courses with this professor or have you missed a few classes? If not he was probably just being a pretentious bore.

He didn't say it.  I typed it, then second-guessed myself immediately after.
<p>
I'm not yet at an expensive enough college to have pretentious, boring professors.  Wait a few years, though.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>
