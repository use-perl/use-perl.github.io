This means I've got to get back to the GUICS.  I suspect I'll end up trashing the code I had and rewriting from scratch (now that I know my way around things a bit better than last time).  I realize that's a lazy way to do it, but I'm impatient.  :)

I also, due to my brain damage, picked up _Serious Sam 2: TSE_, and I must say, in the history of shooting things that aren't real, this is the best experience of not-shooting not-real things.  Due to the specialized gravity effects, you can have multiple gravities in a single level.  What does that mean?  That means that if you strafe left and walk, it looks like the room is turning, but it isn't, as evidenced by the hundreds of enemies that are walking all the way around this thing to come kill you.
<P>
Another good piece of news:  My back money came from the VA, which means I can now afford to not worry about rent and eating, and can get my car fixed.  </p>
