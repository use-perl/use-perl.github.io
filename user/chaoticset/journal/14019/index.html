<p>I've just had a luscious, thick BLT and a glass of Royal Crown, so I'm in a fairly good mood now.
<P>
Sometimes I just try to imagine fun things to do to, say, the RIAA.  (I know, I'm a juvenile delinquent at heart...)  I'll be bored, and I'll imagine going to one of their press conferences, hijacking the PA somehow, and projecting a puppet show up on the stage.
<P>
"You mean the assholes who keep screwing my favorite musicians aren't making enough money because I keep downloading music?" one puppet says to another.  "Yes, that's exactly it!  Don't you feel sad?" the other one says.  "No, I don't.  Let's go download the new Britney Spears album a week before they release it!"  "Me neither!  Let's go!  Woo hoo!"
<P>
I mean, honestly -- how stupid can these people be?  I'm boggled.  My mind is so boggled I want to <EM>play</EM> Boggle.  I'm really, really confused.
<P>
Don't these people understand that they're pissing off the people who pay their wages?  I mean, it's not like they're the only game in town any more.  They're screwed.  If I were them, I'd be very, very quiet and hope to not be lynched to death.
<P>
Honestly, I think Bill Gates is wasting his time.  If I were him, I'd be causing chaos as anonymously as possible -- buying advertising time to run fake PSAs claiming the buying music is wrong, causing as much animosity as possible -- just for the sake of entertainment.  I mean, he's got the money, and James Bond doesn't exist.
<P>
Why isn't he trying to finish a world takeover?  I'd have a bone white cat on my lap and get some sharks with frickin' laser beams attached to their heads by now...
<P>
It's damn hot.  I'm going to play Nethack.  Everybody says I don't have enough fun, well, to hell with them!  I'm going to play lots and lots of Nethack.
<P>
It'd be more fun if I wasn't so bad at it...I've never made it past the fourth floor of the dungeon...  :(</p>

<h2>If you like NetHack...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/WebDragon/">WebDragon</a> on 2003-08-10T07:59:12</h3>
<p>If you like NetHack, then you'll probably love <a href="http://thangorodrim.angband.org/" title="angband.org">Angband Web</a angband.org> and <a href="ftp://clockwork.dementia.org/angband/" title="dementia.org">Angband FTP</a dementia.org>, which is a roguelike that evolved slowly from Rogue and Moria (if you recall those).</p>

<p>Color; Unique monsters, weapons and artifacts; optional <b>randomized</b> artifacts; multiple term windows; ported to every platform in existence (nearly); haggling; very balanced gameplay, etc.</p>

<p>I did a little characterization a long time back of a game I was playing at the time and had some rather incredible luck with. <a href="http://www.webdragon.net/angband/" title="webdragon.net">The tale of Olias</a webdragon.net> should be an entertaining read.</p>

<p>This is very easily my most favorite AD&amp;D simulation of all time. Just be forewarned; it's terribly addicting!</p>
