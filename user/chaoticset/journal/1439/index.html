<p>And I can't afford to be, so I'll probably end up taking a nap soon here.
<P>
I did something stupid.  I got good advice and then ignored it just because my mental game-theory-matrix calculator said there was a possible payoff:  Chip Salzenberg himself told me to get and attempt to install Debian, but when I noticed I had a Red Hat CD kicking around, I tried installing it instead, hoping I'd save download time.
<P>
Note to self:  Take more heed of your betters, because they have good reasons.
<P>
Anyway, it took me all of last night and an hour this morning to find out that it was a mistake.  I'm going off in search of the Debian downloads I'll need, then I'm going to burn a CD with just the stuff I have to have, and then I'm going to install it, come hell or high water.
<P>
Well...I'll try my damndest.  Time is a variable I cannot control; it may take me days to get it installed right, and years more to learn it.
<P>
I can only say that I will be there, trying again.

There'll be time to rest in the grave...

<h2>Red Hat</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vek/">vek</a> on 2001-11-30T15:38:21</h3>
What was the issue with installing Red Hat?  I just recently installed it on a co-workers laptop and had little or no trouble whatsoever - he had a 7.1 cd.

I know that Red Hat may not be as "trendy" as Debian or Mandrake (I'm actully running Mandrake on my laptop) but I've used - and still use Red Hat (on my home desktop for one).
<br>
<br>Sarcasm ahead:

<br>linux geek -&gt; Do you run linux then?
<br>win geek   -&gt; Er, no.
<br>linux geek -&gt; You suck.

<br>linux geek  -&gt; Do you run linux then?
<br>linux geek2 -&gt; Yep.
<br>linux geek  -&gt; yeh, but what distribution?
<br>linux geek2 -&gt; Red Hat
<br>linux geek  -&gt; You suck.
<br>
<br>Shame really as linux rocks - <b>who cares</b> what bloody distribution it is - get a life.

<p>and could print none of them here<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I gave up on RH when the upgrade from 4.0 -&gt; 4.2 went so completely and horribly wrong that I finally embraced the darkness within and went over to the BSD side of the force.</p>

<p>Use BSD. <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/" title="netbsd.org">NetBSD</a netbsd.org> and <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/" title="openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a openbsd.org> are both outstanding products and seem to be free of much of the annoyances people have with RH and other Linux distributions.</p>

<p>"BSD is Linux for grown-ups" -- I forget who said this but I still giggle<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<br>
<br>That's until more of the masses adopt BSD then the <b>old</b> BSD clan will have to move on as it won't be <b>trendy</b> to run BSD anymore.  That new linux distribution that they find will then become<nobr> <wbr></nobr><i>...Linux for grown-ups</i> (grin).

Of course I meant to say <i> That new <b>unix</b> distribution...</i> and not <i>linux distribution</i>.  Just wanted to make that discaimer before I get flamed - I <b>well</b> aware that BSD is not a linux variant but a unix variant.  This will turn out to be one of those <i>my OS is better than your OS</i> if we're not careful and we all know how those flamewars suck.  So this teeny mini-thread should probably die a death now.

<h2>Red Hat vs Debian</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2001-11-30T15:52:20</h3>
<p>I suspect you'll be disappointed. Debian may well be "better" than Red Hat in a number of ways (most of which are purely subjective) but if there's one area where Red Hat, Mandrake and SuSE beat Debian hands down, it's in ease of installation.</p>

Indeed. The thing is, how many times does one install Linux on a single system?
