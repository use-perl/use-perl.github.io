<p>PNY has still not emailed me back.
<P>
A day is one thing.  When we get past the 24 hours mark I'm going to start getting very displeased with these people.
<P>
It won't matter, though.  I've been unable to locate a number for their tech support.  At this point, I'm pretty sure I can write off the data on my Attache altogether, and it pisses me off.
<P>
I'm gonna give it until tomorrow and then I'm going to start calling random numbers.  I got the hang of the Dell phone system; why not PNY's?
<P>
Actually, a memory of my time on the Dell contract just floated up.  A customer called in -- as customers always did -- to find out when his system was going to get shipped back.
<P>
This was not extraordinary.  What was extraordinary was that this customer had called, literally, every single day we had the computer.  Historical phone calls listed showed somewhere around 30 calls concerning a 3 week time period.  (To be fair, this customer had spent a chunk of time with tech support on the horn, too, so not all of those were "when's it being shipped?" calls.)
<P>
But, as if the people on the production floor had gotten sick of it, there were copious notes about 3/4 of the way into his calls, detailing the length of time it would take for the system to get shipped and indicating it was a day or two from being sent to the customer.  I informed the customer of this, and they thanked me and ended the call.
<P>
There is not a doubt in my mind that the next day that guy called again.  Maybe twice.
<P>
I don't know that I want to go that far, but...well, this <EM>is</EM> something my parents got me.  I probably will if it comes to it.</p>
