<p>Every time I start to think I sort of know what I'm doing in this language, I keep getting painful reminders that I know far less than necessary to be proficient.
<P>
Case in point:  I have JUST realized that I can create hashes in hashes and such.  I had read about them some time ago and my mind found it too arcane to work with at the time.  Now, I'd like to slap myself, it looks so simple.
<P>
Anyway, because I am unfamiliar with it, I'm going slow.  First, just try to get the basic commands working (add name, delete name, quit) and see if I can put a list of people whom I know the names of in as keys.  I'll throw initial Friendship Ratings in as values for now; but when the structures are built properly, they'll be in a very different place.
<P>
Oh, and *displaying the current list*!  That too.  I forgot all the stuff I painstakingly read about how to use formats, so I'll go brush up on that and whip something together.
<P>
Then it's time to see where I forgot a semicolon this time.  ;)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Quick Addendum:  Oh, and happy NYE.  I plan on getting fairly drunk and watching almost the entirety of _Twilight Zone_ on Sci-Fi.  Rod Serling was a genius...I could gush for hours about RS.  The stuff he wrote then, 90% was cutting-edge, and even now, the 25% of it that's barely edgy by today's standards is still great to watch.  The other 65% still rank as classics in their own right.
<P>
The 10%, of course, is for the crap he wrote.  (Hey, most people only *wish* they screwed things up 1 out of 10 times, and what quality was hit the other 90%!)
