<p>I may need to start shopping around for a new hard drive, because my current one, bless its filthy little heart, is starting to die.  I've had shit luck with it in the past, and shipped it off to HP for tinkering, and got it back with what appeared to be the same hard drive but in functional condition.
<p>
At the time, a week or so without a computer nearly sent me off into the Wild Blue Crazy, so I didn't bat an eyelash when some errors cropped up again.  That was quite some time back, though, and now it's started the downhill slide.  Access times are going up, occasional boot errors are occurring, etc.
<p>
First things first -- back up all the important stuff, attempt to reformat and reinstall.  (Although this time it'll be multiple-partition, because I want to have Linux on it.)  If that fails, though...drastic measures will be required.
<p>
And if that works out well, I might be lucky enough to be able to stick my head in the sand for another year or so.  Who knows?</p>

What, you like living <b> <i>dangerously</i> </b>?<br>
Buy a new hard drive, they are much cheaper that the equivalent amount of time and aggravation you are going through.
