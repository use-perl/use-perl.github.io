<p><UL>
<LI>I haven't finished the journalizer; far from it, because of an impulsive birthday purchase.  (If you're interested, check <A HREF="http://5050.blogspot.com/">Fifty/Fifty</A>.)
<LI>I've realized that -- once again -- my knowledge is exceeding my experience.  I <EM>know</EM> how to write something that'll parse a web page -- it's not beyond me -- but I haven't done it properly yet, so I'm finding it hard to start.  I've had this problem before, so I need to start watching it and trying to do more little things now and again.
<LI>Just made <A HREF="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=117316">abbot</A>.  I feel fairly guilty about it, though, due to my low lurk/post ratio.  (Hey, there should be some sort of 'days never posted/number of posts' ratio on user pages.  Maybe I could write something to calculate one, as a little thing.  ;)  )
<LI>I realized in the supermarket today that I will probably never be as good and flexible a cook as I want to be, at least for a few years.  I feel okay shelving it for now and trying again in a few years, perhaps, though.
<LI>I was absolutely blown away by <A HREF="http://www.geeksalad.org/fork/all.html">clintp's fork explanation</A>.  <EM>Now</EM> I get fork.  It'll be a bit before I can use it effectively, but now I understand it.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Quick Addendum:  Just in case you went there and didn't see it, the impulsive purchase was an Xbox.

Guy, "So, I'm uh mostly liquid!"<br> <br>I think you mean *high* lurk to post ratio.<br>Big div small eq Big.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

I think I meant low *post to lurk* ratio.

My internal perfectionist prevents me from posting because of twiddly little slip-ups like that.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:\</p>
