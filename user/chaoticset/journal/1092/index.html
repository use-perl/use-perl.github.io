<p>Parsing perlmonks reveals that the responses were very helpful (they almost always are) and pointed me in the right direction.
<P>
In fact, it alerted me to a security problem.  That's the equivalent of trying clothes on in front of a friend and them noticing a hole in it:  You get to fix it before you have to cover your ass with it.
<P>
I was putting all the prices into the page and making them into returned parameters.  (Originally, we had looked at making the price updates happen constantly.  It wasn't a terrible idea, but I can't implement something like that, and I suspect that the problems resulting from it would be rather prohibitively numerous.)  The idea was that whatever the price was when they *first looked at it* would remain consistent.
<P>
Someone pointed out to me that they could just view the source, change parameters, and set their own prices.
<P>
That, as they say, would be <B>bad</B>.
<P>
So I thought:  "Well, that's okay.  I'll just confirm the prices against the stock file before they go in the cart.  A price check."
<P>
Then it occurred to me.
<P>
"...but if I'm checking the price, I might as well not have it in the page..."
<P>
Wonderful.  Cuts down the amount of HTML I have to rely on, cuts down the amount of bizarre extra variables I have to keep track of, and cuts down on necessary matching (previously, it would have matched to each entry in a file and then had to match again; now, it just matches the entry, grabs the value, and moves along.)
<P>
Now the fun part:  Implementation.
<P>
I printed a copy of the code; surprisingly, it's *three pages long*!  I hadn't realized it was growing this much.
<P>
I'm curious how long it is without comments and blank lines.  I'll probably write a one-liner later to rip 'em out and give me a line count.
<P>
I'm glad to be updating for a reason, and I'm really glad that I feel like I can work again.  Yesterday I was supposed to be working on this and all I did was update my journal and fall asleep a lot.
<P>
Doctor's appointment in...two days, I think.  Good.  It'll be nice to see what the hell my doctor looks like now.  Friggin' HMOs.
<P>

Quick Addendum:  I meant to mention this before, but I noticed someone talking about <A HREF="www.brainbench.com">brainbench</A> either here or at monks (I think it was monks) and investigated it just a bit.  Seems like an interesting idea.  Wonder if it's something I should try to get rated on or not.

I think brainbench's slogan -- "The Measure of Achievement" -- is all you need to know to know that it is not worth your time.  It does not and cannot measure achievement.  Fight the power.  Measure achievement the old-fashioned way: look at what is actually achieved!
