<p>My brothers and stepfather were going to a gun show and asked me along.  I've been to a few now, and it's kind of an interesting experience.  I know someone who has written for _Morbid Curiosity_, and have considered writing an article on gun shows for it.
<P>
I brought along plenty of notepaper and a section of Ruby.new, the super-short quickie introduction to Ruby syntax, so I could try to learn it and then look at the rest of Ruby another time.  I already have the Win32 Ruby port set up, along with the IDE it includes, and tested it a little bit.  I like it so far, but I only did the "good night" example so far.
<P>
I think I'm being flim-flammed.  I distinctly remember being scheduled in at 2:00 today, but when I went online and asked the guy who was my instructor (Jerry) at work, he said I was scheduled in at 11:30.  I'm pretty sure he's lying, but it's a moot point anyway -- I don't have the car until just a little before 2, so I can't come in.  If he's not lying, it's not a huge deal, just major irritation as I attempt to remove points from my record at work.
<P>
I get a little more Jabber than I did before.  It's really kind of interesting -- I'm always more interested in transformational actions, something that can change one thing to another, because it lessens the strain of trying to learn multiple things.  Jabber seems to be flexible enough to create plenty of different kinds of things.</p>
