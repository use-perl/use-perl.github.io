<p>I found the thing I remembered, an entry in koschei's journal.  Unfortunately, it doesn't refer to the behavior I had in mind, I think, so I may have to attempt to write some patches/requests and see what happens.  That or cobble something entirely different together, whichever comes first.
<P>
Sleep, right.  Sleep comes first.
<P>
I'd promise myself to the coding demon tomorrow, but I have several bills and a large chunk of rent to pay off tomorrow, assuming I can get my paycheck and it's not tiny for some reason I didn't foresee.  I'd further promise myself to the coding demon Saturday, but it looks like the social-gathering end-of-training party is happening then, and I frankly don't want to miss it if I can help it.  I like everybody in my training group a lot, and I'm going to miss most of these people when I don't see them anymore.  (In the sense that I won't be getting concurrent breaks with them, possibly never see some of them again due to scheduling peccadilloes.)
<P>
I really do want to get the journalizer to a finalized state of "working".  I miss coding.  I miss coding Tk, even though I'm not great at it yet.
<P>
Tired.  Got a cup of tea and a little ramen to get to bed with.</p>
