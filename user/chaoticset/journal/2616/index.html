The title:  Yet Another MST3K Reference (YAMR).  The ep is _Agent For H.A.R.M._, a stinky little low-budget spy movie, but the specifics are too "you had to be there" to go into.  If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about.
<P>
1/3rd of the way through perlboot, I was doing that little head-nodding thing where I know what's going on.  Shortly after that my conceptualization failed, mainly because there are so many little examples that it's difficult to know which are standalones and which are just "this is a syntax example, right here".  Right now, I have
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Mouse->speak;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
along with the definition for Animal, Cow, and Mouse.  Mouse->speak invokes the method speak of the package Mouse.  If speak needed arguments, it would be Mouse->speak(args);, and if $a = "Mouse" and I go $a->speak;, it'll still work.
<P>
These things I have gathered so far.  I'm still, at this point, kind of unaware of how data gets stuck in these things, but it's less a question and more that my brain is full for the day.  :)  I did learn a sugar cookie recipe too, so that accounts for some of that space.
<P>
Plus, I'm extremely fuzzy on references and dereferencing (see earlier journal entries concerning dereferencing and list context) so I don't expect to quite understand the later examples, where great use of references are made, just yet.
<P>
The schmuck downstairs had a hissy fit because the landlord found the door open again.  I get the feeling that he won't be around much longer.  Good riddance.
<P>
I wonder if ZenHam disliked my comment so much that it turned him off of comments altogether.  :\  Sorry.  I have a thing for Connie Willis, and an anti-thing for Hollywood adaptations.</p>
