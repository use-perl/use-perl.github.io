<p>No, I'm not actually angry at Torgo.  I just like saying that every once in a while, in the same tone Willy Shatner said "KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!", because I remember saying it when I watched <B>Manos:  The Hands Of Fate</B> and the poor schmuck would attempt something 'dastardly'.
<P>
Yes, I actually have a reason to write in this journal.
<P>
The CGI isn't working.  Well, it's working, it's just not working well.  What I mean to say is that-
<P>
I'll just explain what it's doing.
<P>
The table I need it to print has the following five slots.  The first is a checkbox (to indicate that the customer wants *that* card), and the last is a text box (to indicate *how many* they want).  The middle three, in order, are the card's name, quantity in stock, and cost.
<P>
|box|Card Name|Stock|Cost|text|
<P>
Now, all of this except the cost needs no formatting.  The stock is an integer; the name is a string, and the others are hard-coded in the script.
<P>
I hard-coded a dollar sign in front of the cost and a decimal point along with double zeroes after.  (I know this is sloppy, but my client said he wanted it rounded to the nearest dollar.  He said that possibly, in the future, he'd want 25 cent increments, but that whole dollar values are fine for now.)
<P>
So, knowing this is sloppy and more than a little awful, I did it.  Mainly because the sooner all this is put together, the sooner I can contribute to the household income.  (Besides, once I'm on as maintainer, I'll fix this stuff.  I am commenting fairly liberally.)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Oh, and am I EVER happy with Perl.  Just discovered how subroutines being passed values works, and I must say that it's impressively handy.  I realize my admiration isn't much when it's heaped on the pile, but thank you once again, Larry, and thanks to everyone who's work(ed|ing) on Perl in general.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Next up...lessee.  I need a format for the cart file and I need to make this script build one.  I need to make the textbox at the top that lets you weed out big chunks of the list.
<P>
I need a much, much longer text list, so I can get some idea of what return time on the page will be like.
<P>
Frankly, I could also use some shrimp fried rice, but I've got so much food here...I guess I'll look in the fridge and maybe make some egg salad.  Got plenty of Dew, so I'm okay on that side of things.
