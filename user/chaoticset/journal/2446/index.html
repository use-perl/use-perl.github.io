<p>Well, I got lucky, I guess.  My parents came and payed for the new alternator.  The guy at the garage, out of the kindness of his heart it would seem, replaced my ignition lock as well.
<P>
I wish the Personal Crisis was going quite this well.  It's far too off topic, not even concerning music or coffee.
<P>
I have seen my doctor, gotten a prescription, and managed to fill it.  I have a tiny little bottle of antibiotic drops for my eye now, and it's feeling much, much better.  2 drops every three hours.  (The problem is that it drains into my sinus cavity and then into my mouth, where I note that the taste is remarkably similar to sour milk and vodka.  I use up two or three little Listerine films trying to get rid of that taste.)  The doc says the antibiotic was being talked about in the news in relation to anthrax, had I heard of it?  I reply that I don't watch the news; it's mostly all the same, and it's mostly all bad.
<P>
In other good news, I have lots of coffee and some caramel syrup left over; so, to celebrate the car and my return to working on GUICS, I'm going to have some caramel coffee.
<P>
I should note that I have Trillian working, and I like it so much I'm going to copy it onto a Zip disk so I can have it at school.  It'll be very handy; normally, if I want to message at school, I end up running the web versions of AIM and Yahoo at the same time.  Trillian will make this six times easier.  It's the best thing I could have hoped to come out of the IM standards conference I seem to remember happening sometime last year, or perhaps late 2000.</p>
