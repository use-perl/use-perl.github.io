<p>Despite all the good sense I possess, last night I actually went to a bar with five other people and had drinks and discussed nothing in particular.  Highlights of the evening were few, but included:
<OL>
<LI>A comedian that was actually funny <EM>and</EM> from Milo, Maine (of all places)
<LI> The curly fries at Dysart's, which are surprisingly good and wonderfully plentiful
</OL>
I was almost full just from the fries.
<P>
Tonight's plan, after I get home from my mother's, is to fart around more with the cyberspace game code and see if I can make it pass the last tests.  (Although I should maybe see if there are more customer tests yet.  Would those be added whenever, or would more get added only when all the ones that are current get done?  Need to investigate the process more at the website.)
<P>
The night before last I managed to get a mockup of the website put together (the website I'm doing as a favor to a friend, simple but hopefully effective) and I'm planning to dump the results to a directory on my perlmonk space so that I can send him the URL and get some sort of feedback.  It doesn't look terrible, but right now I'm missing some key stuff they want on there -- samples, photos, etc.</p>
