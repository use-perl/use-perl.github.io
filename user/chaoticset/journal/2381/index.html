<p>I was flipping through an overdue library book and noticed a list of incorrect (but very interesting) misspellings of 'isosceles'.  One of the more interesting ones was 'nysosselees', because of the n, and then it occurred to me.
<P>
"An isosceles triangle" could be misunderstood as "<EM>A nysosselees</EM> triangle."
<P>
The fluidity of language.
<P>
Anyway, I didn't come here to display my love of language.  (Well, not English, anyway.)
<P>
Got a cup of coffee; have homework to do (in Excel -- I still laugh sometimes that I do <EM>homework</EM> in <EM>Excel</EM>.) and a class to attend at 4.  Finally, the hardware class!
<P>
Need more coffee.
<P>
SOTF went on a cleaning spree yesterday and dragged me along for part of it; during, I related some of the tale of ISBNs and CueCat that I read in hfb's journal.  I should have realized I was digging myself a grave.
<P>
"We have a CueCat!" she said, brightly, about halfway through.  I don't think she'll remember anything about the discussion (although she gets things when I explain them, she tends to forget them just as easily), but if she does, looks like I'll be begging code.  ;)
<P>
Speaking of which, I've noticed I have a fairly large mass of books.  Not a real "library" mass, really, but enough for the rolling double-sided five-tier cart-thing to be overflowing with 'em.  Lots of that is second-hand sci-fi, though.  :)
<P>
The good news is that this homework is the *only* homework, if memory serves.  Good thing, because I want to get some work done this weekend on the GUICS.</p>
