<p>I loaded <em>Effective Perl Programming</em> onto my Safari bookshelf and have been slowly going through it, trying to maximize my exposure to all the nuggets of skill-enhanced goodness.  Unfortunately, the times I've found myself beating on map and grep are the times that I'm away from the house and on my laptop, with no connection to speak of.
<p>
I realized that I could <em>use</em> my download tokens, as well, and have collected about half the book for temporary reference purposes on my laptop.  (Unfortunately, I believe I'm going to have to install a PDF reader on there.)  Depending on how fruitful the remaining half turn out to be, I may download them as well.
<p>
I've come to the conclusion that keeping perhaps three or four books on the shelf permanently may be a very good idea -- it's not like I couldn't take them off in an emergency, and it's nice not to carry the damn things around all the time.</p>

Am I missing something here our would
<blockquote><div> <code>
perldoc -f map<br>
perldoc -f grep
</code> </div></blockquote>
work for you?

<blockquote><div> <tt>map</tt> </div></blockquote> has proven to be thorny enough that I need a few examples if I've gotten it wrong the first time.  <blockquote><div> <tt>grep</tt> </div></blockquote> not so much, but it's something that's not quite native to me yet, and I like to have some examples handy.
<p>
Which isn't to crap on the docs -- they have good examples -- it's just that the books tend to have examples that are more illustrative.</p>
