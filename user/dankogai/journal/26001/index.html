<p>This is my first entry to the U.S. with fingerprints recorded.  Visa Waiver no longer waives that intimidating Homeland Securty Act measures.<br/><br/>That much I understood a priori.  What I didn't know was....<br/><br/>Officer:
    You are visiting here for....
Dan:
    A conference. OSCON 2005
Officer:
    Your company is...
Dan:
    I'm self-employed.
Officer:
    What kind of conference?
Dan:
    Open Source.
Officer:
    Open Source? What is that?<br/><br/>How many times have you hosted OSCON, Portland?<br/><br/>Officer:
    Do you have any information about the conference with you?
Dan:
    Well, I have mails. Nice computer you've got. Can you check web pages with that?
Officer:
    Unfortunately, no. Don't you have anything in paper?
Dan:
    No. Do you want to check my powerbook?
Officer:
    That's fine. I believe you. But next time you visit bring more materials about the conference.
Dan:
    Yes, sir.<br/><br/>How fortunate I am not a U.S. Citizen.  If I were I couldn't stand the system that checks my fingerprint and portrait without being able to check puny web pages.<br/><br/>Dan the Persona Non Grata

<h2>Being a US Citizen, I think it is very fortunate</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Limbic Region/">Limbic Region</a> on 2005-08-01T12:37:25</h3>
There are report cards for every US government agency every year WRT IT security.  More often then not, there are several agencies that don't do very well.<br><br>I would really prefer keeping information such as fingerprint databases off public facing systems if they can't get their IT security right.<br><br>Cheers<br>L~R



<h2>and the documentation he asked for would help how?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2005-08-01T14:25:23</h3>
just how would a printed email (easily spoofed and nontrivial to discredit) or fake letterhead or business card make an iota of difference?<br/><br/>Like a lot of the 'war on turrr' this is just a waste of time and money.
