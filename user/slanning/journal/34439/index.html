<p>On the <a href="http://poe.perl.org/?POE_Support_Resources/POE's_mailing_list">POE mailing list</a>, <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/poe@perl.org/msg03795.html">someone guessed</a> that books like "<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perlbp/">Perl Best Practices</a>" and "<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perlhks/">Perl Hacks</a>" have probably sold 2000 copies max. Is it true? I wouldn't've guessed they are best-sellers, but that seems really low.... (Are you sure Perl isn't dying? :) :)</p>

<h2>I doubt those numbers</h2>

The Mason book sold more than that (not a _lot_ more), and it's a very niche book compared to something like PBP. My guess for PBP would be in the low tens of thousands (10k-30k), but probably not hundreds of thousands.<br>

I'm not actually allowed to give sales figures, but autarch's estimate is *much* closer than the "somebody's guess" reported by the OP.

<h2>Programming Language Trends</h2>

I wonder if there is an updated version of <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/08/programming_language_trends_1.html" title="oreilly.com">this graph</a oreilly.com>?



<h2>Perl Testing, Perl Hacks</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2007-09-13T17:57:23</h3>
<p>Like Damian, I can't give exact numbers.  I will say that some 95% of books published in all genres in the world never sell 5000 copies.  Both Perl Hacks and Perl Testing: A Developer's Notebook have crested that, so they've reached at least a very modest success (that is, not losing money).</p>

<p>Note that neither book has ever had a Slashdot review, and both books have received only a handful of reviews anywhere.  If someone reads this and thinks "Hey, I could influence the Perl book market for the positive," please write a review somewhere more public than PerlMonks, use Perl;, or The Perl Review.</p>

<p>(I definitely appreciate the reviews in those places, but I think the audiences there know about the books by now.)</p>

Where should we post reviews?  That is, what 3-4 places would be most helpful for sales?<br><br>Whenever I post a review, I've done it to my local Perl Mongers and to my journal.  An author recently said, "Hey, could you post that at Amazon?  It can help sales."<br><br>I'd never given that any thought, but it made sense, so I went and published all my old tech book reviews there.  If there were a few other places that you said were a great place to post, I (and probably others) would be happy to do so.<br><br>In other words: how can we help sell books?

My publishing friends say that a (good) review on Amazon boosts sales. I don't have anything to back that up other than marketing people telling me that.<br><br>I'm glad to post reviews in TPR too. I'm working on some stuff to add extra, online only content to theperlreview.com too, and I'll be glad to post well-written public reviews once I get that set up.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>Re:Perl Testing, Perl Hacks</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2007-09-14T16:50:20</h3>
<p>In my experience, a good Slashdot review is worth more to a technical book than a review just about anywhere else.  Good reviews on Amazon or other online bookstores are also useful.  Anywhere there are a lot of people who might like the book but who aren't tied tightly into the Perl community is a good target.</p>

<p>I haven't seen a correlation between tags on Amazon and sales, but I haven't seen many tags on tech books there either.</p>

<h2>Books aren't good business</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2007-09-13T21:07:28</h3>
<i>Learning Perl</i> sells well, <i>Intermediate Perl</i> sells about 1/10th or that, and I expect <i>Mastering Perl</i> will sell 1/10th of <i>Intermediate Perl</i> (I should get my first sales report at the end of this month). I would have probably made more money taking an advance for <i>Mastering Perl</i> because I don't think I'll ever earn it out. I'll be happy if it ever gets to 1,000 copies sold. That's not the point though. It's a book I wanted to point people too and that I kept wishing existed. So, I wrote it. Now I can point at it and say, "That's chapter 3 in <i>Mastering Perl</i>".<br><br>The best books are the very beginner books, and the books that would come right after that, such as <i>Perl Best Practices</i> or <i>Perl Cookbook</i>, because those appeal to the whole market. Once you break the market into a niche, such as Mason or Poe or Template, you get the same sell through (probably), but only for that narrow slice of the market.<br><br>Any serious computer book author has to consider that they'll spend 18 months wokring on a book and never make more than the advance, which might only be a couple thousand dollars if they are lucky. Any serious and competent publisher realizes this too, so they don't do a lot of niche books. That some publishers do has more to do with overall brand and reputation than single title sales. That O'Reilly would even consider publishing a risky (in sales) book such as <i>Mastering Perl</i> is almost charity, and they do a lot of that. They aren't going to go into the poor house though.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
