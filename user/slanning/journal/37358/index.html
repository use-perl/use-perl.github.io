<p>There's a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/04/AR2008090403398.html?nav=rss_print/asection">boycott</a> in Chicago by school children from urban schools. In the first paragraph it's mentioned that "they often have to share books ... meaning they can't take books home to study". At the bottom they talk about spending <b>$120 million</b> over three years to build more schools. Just for Chicago. We have the web now, even in the USA. Why can't money like that be invested in more fundamental improvements that would benefit everybody, like building free, public-domain, online textbooks? At least at the state level. It's like schools are letting textbook publishers steal money from children.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you're expecting to happen.  They're talking about "creating new schools," which sounds like they mean new buildings.  Kids are probably sharing books because the schools are over capacity, which is a common problem in cities.  They need more (or larger) school buildings, with staff and books.</p><p>Public domain books would be a great initiative, but making them available online doesn't help children of families that have no access to the internet at home.  Beyond that, I can imagine a thousand legitimate cries of, "I wanted to study but the textbook was suffering a DDoS."</p><p>They'll still need to be printed.  Let the government seek low bidders.</p>
