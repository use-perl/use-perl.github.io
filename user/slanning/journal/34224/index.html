<p><p>I've been playing with <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/">OGRE</a> recently. It's an "Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine"
made in C++. The <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/docs/api/html/">documentation</a> and <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/Ogre_Tutorials">tutorials</a> on the site are excellent.</p>
<p>As always, there are <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/PyOgre">Python bindings</a> and <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/OgreDotNet_Introduction">.NET bindings</a> but not a Perl one. You'd almost think Perl was dying. So I started to change that
with a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/slanning/Ogre-0.1/">minimal Perl binding</a>. So far, it's not very useful (no input/event handling), but I was able to reproduce a basic tutorial after having stripped out the CEGUI and OIS  parts.</p></p>

<h2>Dying?</h2>

Bear in mind Ruby doesn't have bindings either.<br><br>I think it's more the case that Python is used quite a bit more in the area of graphics and gaming (The PyGames package for instance) so there's more interest in that area for Python.<br><br>Don't forget to update their wiki to note your bindings.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p><div class="quote">more the case that Python is used quite a bit more in the area of graphics and gaming</div>  <p>Okay, then -- in what areas, besides web programming (if that), and probably sysadmin scripting, is Python not used quite a bit more than Perl? Python at least has the *reputation* of being what one would go to if one were serious about what one were writing.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough trolling.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I will update the OGRE wiki, once the module is more usable. I made a ninja example last night, and it looks sweet....<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I'll put that out tomorrow or so. Today I've been working on "FrameListeners"; the hard part being making them able to call out to Perl code (and still be C++ subclasses that are passed into whatever "addListener" methods). I hope I can get that working stably. In any case, the C++ API is enormous, and I hope I don't lose interest before getting it usefully wrapped. (Also I'm off work this week, so have more energy to work on it.)</p>
<p>I've been writing in XS, don't know if it would be easier using Swig. I think I'll eventually wrap enough of it that I'll see what the patterns are and make scripts to generate the wrappers from the header files. I did that a lot in the wrapping for Mozilla::DOM.</p>
