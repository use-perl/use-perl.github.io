<p><p><a href="http://bricolage.cc/downloads/">Bricolage 1.10.6</a> was released. Might be the last one in the 1.10 series. <a href="http://bricolage.cc/about/team/">David</a> will probably release version 1.11.1 soon, which is a "developer release" for 2.0. He's been hacking on the ajaxy stuff recently.</p></p>

Thanks - I just did the upload itself but let someone else do the "announcement" page, so the link is still broken. Le voici:<blockquote><div><p> <tt>VERSION 1.10.6 (2008-10-02)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Improvements<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;Added an " TraceEnable off " entry to the config in ApacheConfig.pm for Apache 1.3 to neutralize the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;potentially malicious use of HTTP TRACE requests.&nbsp; &lt;http://www.apacheweek.com/issues/03-01-24&gt; [Dave<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beaudet, Alex Krohn]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;Changed an index in the story and media instance tables to improve query speed. Thanks to Alex Krohn<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for reporting the performance issue. [David and Josh Berkus]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;Tweaked contrib/bric_media_upload/bric_media_upload so that it uses "bric_soap site list_ids"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;instead of "bric_soap category list_ids" for setting the login cookie. That should be more efficient<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for installations that have many more categories than they have sites. [Scott]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;Added "--use-related-uri" option to "bric_soap". [Scott, David]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;For media uploaded through the Story Profile, the cover date now defaults to the current date/time<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;instead of the cover date of the story. [Scott]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;Added search by Keyword to "Find Media". [Scott]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;When the "Filter by Site Context" preference is turned on, if a user does a search and then changes<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the site context, the search results will not change to the new site until the user submits a new<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;search. Reported by Matt Rolf (Bug #1337). [David]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;Rewrote (again) the way in which stale files are identified for expiration. It used to be that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bricolage would look for all resources associated with a given document and output channel but none<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;of the current jobs. But if a story had previously been in two output channels and one was removed,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bricolage didn&amp;#8217;t look for stale files in that output channel. So now Bricolage asks for a list of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;resources associated with a document but none of the jobs created in a publish, and then expires<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;them all, regardless of URI, output channel, or file system path. This should fix the expiration of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;stale files once and for all (Bug #1351). [David]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;The links to jump to different kinds of assets on My Workspace (or a desk if it happens to have dif-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ferent kinds of assets) are now generated in a more sensible manner, and display as text links<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;rather than the ugly images we had previously. [David]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;The "Checkout" and "Publish Checked" buttons in the "Find" interface for stories, media, and tem-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;plates are now displayed on the right-hand side of the screen, better aligning them with the check-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;boxes that they&amp;#8217;re associated with.&nbsp; Suggested by Matt Rolf (Bug #1361). [David]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bug Fixes<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;Really fix bug 1232 (saving categories with 3 keywords), that was falsely claimed to have been fixed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;in 1.10.3. [Scott]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;Fixed bug 1340, where Preview buttons weren&amp;#8217;t working within Related assets.&nbsp; [Scott &amp; David]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;The download link in Media Profile wasn&amp;#8217;t popping up into a new window on some browsers due to a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;typo. Spotted by Tatiana Titova. [Scott]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;In the Contributors Manager, sometimes there aren&amp;#8217;t "New" links, and this was causing the latest<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Locale::Maketext indigestion. Spotted by John Watson. [Scott]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;Fix for bug 1344 (spotted by Ed Guzman) and hopefully better fix for bug 1326 (my suggestion wasn&amp;#8217;t<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;quite right). The handling of &lt;publish_status&gt; in bric_soap has been a bit dodgy. Also changed pub-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;lish_status to deploy_status in "Bric::SOAP::Template". [Scott]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;The state for Log lists was getting stuck, so if you go to the 2nd page of the log for a media, say,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;every log thereafter was the same. Reported by John Kirkwood. [Scott]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;Fix both parts of bug 1345, Bulk Edit had problems with blank lines. [Scott]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;Fixed CCS bug which was preventing the jump buttons from displaying in Firefox and Safari. [Matt<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rolf]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;Tweaked Bricolage Instance Name display. [Matt Rolf]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;Fixed bug 1343, View Diff wasn&amp;#8217;t working in IE. Reported by Ed Guzman. [Scott]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;A category with associated with a story different URIs but the same name as the primary category can<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;now properly be deleted. Reported by Matt Rolf (Bug #1341). [David]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;Media documents are now properly expired. Reported by Matt Rolf (Bug #1347).&nbsp; [David]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;The login window no longer shows the username in the top right corner right after logging out.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reported by Matt Rolf (Bug #1149). [David]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;Fixed a bug uploading a file to a related media element when that related media element has lockable<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fields. Reported by Scott (Bug #1353). [David]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;Editing user prefs when SSL is enabled no longer breaks the User profile.&nbsp; Reported by Scott<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Bug#1339). [David]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;Reverting an image media document works again. Reported by Scott Lanning (Bug #1352). [David]<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;The links to jump to different kinds of assets on My Workspace (or a desk if it happens to have dif-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ferent kinds of assets) will now jump to the proper page when pagination is turned on. Reported by<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Matt Rolf (Bug #150). [David]</tt></p></div> </blockquote>
