<p><p><b>UPDATE:</b> You're right, I was taking it/things too seriously. <code>$self->panic--</code></p>
<p>----cut-here---8&lt;---------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>(<i>Note: The following is just my humble opinion, and I don't mean to single out the authors of Perl6::Cookbook or Perl6::Doc. The Subject isn't worded too provocatively, is it? :> </i>)</p>
<p>I don't think it's appropriate for modules like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl6-Cookbook/">Perl6::Cookbook</a> to go on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>.
First, I don't think it's a good idea mixing Perl5 and Perl6 code on CPAN unless/until there are clear ways to distinguish them. By that, I don't mean that the module begins with Perl6, for example, but that the tools like the `cpan` shell are able to ignore Perl6 code (or compatibility issues are otherwise resolved). On the other hand, Perl6::Cookbook doesn't actually install code.</p>
<p>And that is my main problem; it is not a useable module. Its content is all under eg/, so it doesn't even install <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html">POD</a> files. Now, several distributions have their own cookbooks (<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Moose/">Moose</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Jifty/">Jifty</a>, ...), but that's different because they are actually documentation of the module, and we certainly don't want to discourage that. Some distributions even separate the docs from the code, like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/YAML-Manual/">YAML::Manual</a>, but again I don't think that's such a big deal (although that one in particular isn't nearly complete :) because it's associated to some module; it could be especially useful when those are optional dependencies of the code distribution.</p>
<p>So I think Perl6::Cookbook is problematic, at least as it's currently implemented, but there is another similar "module" that I'm not so sure about: <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl6-Doc/">Perl6::Doc</a>. It contains the <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/apocalypse.html">apocalypses</a>, <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/synopsis.html">synopses</a>, <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/exegesis.html">exigeses</a> for Perl 6. I'm not sure that should be on CPAN, but on the other hand at least it installs POD files. Also, it's sort of like an informal <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html">RFC</a>. But on the other hand, what use are they being on CPAN since they are already on the pages I linked to?</p>
<p>(<i>Note: I considered uploading this blog entry to CPAN, but decided not to.</i>)</p></p>

<h2>What's the problem?</h2>

I read why you wouldn't put those modules on CPAN, but I don't understand what you think the problem is.  Is there some problem I'm missing?
<p>
What would you like to have happen?  Should those modules be removed from CPAN, perhaps by force?</p>



<h2>I don't see the problem either.</h2>

<p>It is the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network.</p><p>And the CPAN FAQ says:</p><p>What is CPAN?</p><p>CPAN is the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, a large collection of Perl software and documentation. You can begin exploring from either <a href="http://www.cpan.org/" title="cpan.org">http://www.cpan.org/</a cpan.org>, <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/" title="perl.com">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/</a perl.com> or any of the mirrors listed at <a href="http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html" title="cpan.org">http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html</a cpan.org>.</p><p><a href="http://cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html#What_is_CPAN" title="cpan.org">http://cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html#What_is_CPAN</a cpan.org></p><p>So if a blog posting is documenting something maybe it should go on CPAN.</p><p>Robert</p>

That's a bug. When fixed it will install the examples written in Perl 6<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
