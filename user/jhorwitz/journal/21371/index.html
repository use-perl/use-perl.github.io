<p>Found my <I>Solaris Systems Programming</I> book by my front door yesterday evening.  I can't say enough good things about it -- it reads like a tutorial, but makes a great reference as well.  I could have used this book ten years ago!  Great job, Rich Teer.
<P>
In other news, <A HREF="http://freshmeat.net">Freshmeat</A> has posted an <A HREF="http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/1339/"</A>editorial</A> on where Perl 6 is heading.  Now, I've had my doubts about the Perl 6 language and its insatiable need for verbage and strange new operators.  All these extra things don't bother me though, as long as we can improve the core language and have "real" objects, exceptions, and other goodies that Perl 5 is missing.  Oh yeah, let's not forget XS either.  *shudder*  But the author just didn't do his research here, and makes several completely unfounded claims.  I feel your pain, but get your facts straight before posting to a forum like Freshmeat, buddy.</p>

<h2>Perl 6 Editorial</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2004-10-16T19:19:11</h3>
<p>I'm tempted to write an editorial critical of Perl 5's direction.  There's still a chance that lexical variables will turn out to have been a fad from ivory tower languages.</p>



<h2>Standing Problems in Perl 5</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dug/">dug</a> on 2004-10-16T19:50:03</h3>
I only glanced at the headings, so can't really critique the editorial, but I was really turned off when I saw that the first thing under "Standing Problems in Perl 5" was "Lack of Good Accessible Reference Documentation".<br> <br>-- Douglas Hunter<br> <br>



<h2>Its Shlomi Fish</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/schwern/">schwern</a> on 2004-10-16T21:49:23</h3>
I didn't realize it until I noticed he was touting <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/user/shlomif/rindolf/" title="technion.ac.il">Rindolf</a technion.ac.il> as being an alternative to Perl 6.

<p>Shlomi also had a habit of posting to p5p about how horribly broken the perl documentation is and how the Camel should be open source and how someone should fix all this.  Strangely enough they're usually lacking patches and when the patches do come they're less than earth shattering (though I will admit he has gotten a little better as of late).

</p><p>A cursory glance at both Rindolf and his doc patches will show that the man has a very, very shallow vision of what improvements Perl 5 needs.  Most of his doc patches concern avoiding confusion for non-native speakers of English (important, but not exactly astounding).

</p><p>I'd like to simply say "ignore him" except he's managed to find the Freshmeat megaphone.  So hi-ho a debunking I will go.</p>



<h2>Quick delivery</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2004-10-17T00:48:32</h3>
Wow, you got your book fast, eh?  I chose the "no shipping, long delivery time" option.  Maybe I shouldn't have.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

I chose the default two-day shipping.  It wasn't too much more than standard ground.  It's just worth it for some things.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
