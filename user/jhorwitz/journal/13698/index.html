<p><A HREF="http://objective.jesussave.us/propaganda.html">This site</A> is absolutely appalling.  Skip down to the section on Apple.  I don't think I've ever been more offended.  And I quote:

That's right, new Macs are based on Darwinism!While they currently don't advertise this fact to consumers, it is well known among the computer elite, who are mostly Atheists and Pagans. Furthermore, the Darwin OS is released under an "Open Source" license, which is just another name for Communism.

Now, I try and give everyone a chance before I discount them, but this kind of extremist ignorance just pisses me off and makes me want to punch something.</p>

<h2>I'm pretty sure it's a parody</h2>

Note the bit about the "reality distortion field"
at the end, and the fact that their cafeshops
store sells thongs with a bear that read "will you
be my husband?"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<p>

I googled "objective: christian ministries" and can
vouch for the fact that it's been well debated
whether the site is for real or not.  I'm guessing
parody, myself.</p><p>

Heh -- I had that same debate tonight with the person who showed me that site.  We weren't sure *what* it was.  It's just amazing the work that's gone into this.<br/><br/>I guess the thong might be a hint though.  Good catch.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

Landover Baptist, that they're trying to shut down, is definitely parody.  It seems likely they're connected in parody.

Bastards!  I guess that ends my debate then.  And I really wanted someone to hate...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
