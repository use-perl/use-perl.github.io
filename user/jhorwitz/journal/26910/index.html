<p>Some of you may have noticed I haven't been on IRC, coding or journaling lately.  In addition to work taking over my life for a while, I took August off to rebuild my front walk and landing.  A grueling process to do by yourself, but worth it.  Pictures <A HREF="http://www.smashing.org/gallery/walkway">here</A>.  Life is now slowly returning to normal.</p>

Nice set of photos. How long did each of the phases take you? And what's the big yellow machine (labeled "the Beast") that looks like a floor buffer?

I only worked a couple hours a day so I didn't overexert myself.  With that in mind, demo took about a week -- lots of digging and disposal.  The landing took a few days -- most of it digging and measuring properly.  Then I widened the walk about a foot, which took several days.  Laying and compacting the stone was 1 day, and I laid the pavers over 3 days.  That was the worst cuz I had to do a lot of cutting with my brick saw.  Fun, but tedious.
<p>
"The Beast" is a vibrating plate compactor, which is used to compact the stone and then the pavers after they're laid.  What ends up happening is the concrete sand below is compacted under the pavers and is pushed up into the joints, helping to "interlock" the pavers together.  It's really amazing how solid the walk became after compaction.</p>
