<p>I've just about finished the slides for my OSCON talk, and there's <B>46</B> of them...for a 45 minute talk!  I guess having more material is better than having less, but it seems I have more to talk about than I originally thought.  Lots of them are examples which won't take long to discuss, but I guess I'll see when I go through my practice run of this tomorrow with some coworkers.  And I need to leave room for questions at the end.  Hello, BOF session.</p>

<h2>My rule of thumb</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Elian/">Elian</a> on 2003-06-05T15:37:56</h3>
Is 2-3 minutes per slide. You've got the makings of a two or more hour talk there...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Yeah, that's my rule too.  I'm giving 2 90 minutes talk about I'm aiming for 35-40 slides each, which leaves time for questions.  I'd rather go 5-10 minutes under than not finish and have to stop in the middle of something.

<h2>but it's only wafer thin</h2>

I agree with your 2-3 minute rule.  I'll probably skip over some superficial material in the actual presentation and leave it for further reading in the conference materials.  The problem was that at the time of the proposal, I had an outline for about 20 slides, so I selected the 45 minute session.  As time went on though, the scope of the actual project grew by leaps and bounds, and surprise -- I had too much to talk about.<br/><br/>Then again, I don't have a consistent density of material in each slide, so who knows -- I guess my own personal "make test" will tell me more when I do an actual run through of the talk.  I can always hold a BOF session for those who want to know more.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Slides as OSCON conference material are only any use if you provide them on paper or give a download link, so I wouldn't count on the material being useful if you don't do that. (OSCON doesn't do printed stuff for anything but the tutorial sessions)

Ah, good point.  Haven't been to an OSCON since 1999.  I do have a URL in the slides, so hopefully *somebody* will find some use for them.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>done already?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/geoff/">geoff</a> on 2003-06-09T13:23:13</h3>
you're supposed to do the slides the night before the presentation.  didn't anybody tell you that?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
