<p>This year's OSCON has been one long social event.  I've hung out a lot with Geoff Young, Stas Bekman, Eric Cholet, James Smith, Bill Moseley, Chris Shiflett, and a bunch of other people I'm too hung over to remember.  The last two nights we've had 4-hour long open bar parties, and let's just say I've taken full advantage.
<P>
The people from SAMS were VERY generous and fun to hang out with.  It's weird to meet your editor for the first time a year after your book is published.
<P>
I did actually ATTEND some sessions though.  Heckled Geoff at his tutorial, which was very well presented.  I didn't faze him at all.
<P>
Grabbed a drink with Dan Sugalski (Hi Dan!) and chatted about fleshing out the parrot embedding API.  It was a really good conversation, and I think something useful may actually come of it.  :)
<P>
My book signing went okay.  This isn't a sysadmin conference, so there wasn't the highest level of interest.  Got a couple of takers though, so that was fun.  My signing was after Geoff Young and...Wil Wheaton of all people.  What an odd bunch.  :)
<P>
My extproc_perl talk went tremendously.  The crowd was good and very interested in the project, and all my examples worked as designed.  Can't ask for anything more than that.
<P>
Time to get to a talk...</p>

It was nice to meet you and hang out a bit. Your session was definitely the best Perl session I attended.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
</p>
<p>
I found that I need a way to phonetically distinguish you and <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/geoff/" title="perl.org">Geoff</a perl.org> without resorting to the formality of last names. Were you guys rappers in past lives? Maybe J-Ho and G-Yo would work. You guys could go on tour...

Add Eric and we have J-Ho, G-Yo, and E-Cho.  We'll rap in Perl.  God, I need sleep...
