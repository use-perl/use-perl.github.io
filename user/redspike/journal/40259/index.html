<div class="span8">
<p><p>I bought 'Effective Perl Programming' by Joseph N. Hall and Randal L. Schwartz, about two years ago along with 'Intermediate Perl' and 'How to Joust Underwater'. When it arrived I quickly flipped through it and decided I could not really understand a lot of it. My decision then was that it was not the book to read until it looked more friendly. </p>                                                                     <p>It was spotted last week and jumped out of my bookshelf. As I opened it and started to read it, it did not seem to be the book that I had first encountered. In fact it was really quite accessible and rather exciting. I greedily started reading it and skimming through the code examples. Not until I had read it for about an hour did I see that what was once a mystery was now becoming clear. To my delight I could see things that I could use and apply.</p>
<p>This I am sure is not unusual. It was just the right book at the right time, even though it had collected dust on the shelf for a couple of years. I particularly liked the 'Schwartzian Transform'. It felt like reading module source code because it looks like alot of the examples are realword rather than contrived. If I feel that the code is real code then I do seem to take it more seriously. This may be unfair of me to do but its one of the ways a subject keeps my attention.</p>
