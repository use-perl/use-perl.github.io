<p><p>I am reading <a href="http://hop.perl.plover.com/">MJD's Higher Order Perl</a> again and its great to see that my time reading other books on Perl has not been wasted. The first time round I read the words but I did not understand them. Now I am on the inside looking out rather than on the outside looking in.</p>       <p>It matters not how many times I look around I always come back to Perl as it is now the language that I know more than any other. This is a really great thing to realise. </p>                                                                                                        <p>Sadly I missed YAPC::EU again this year and I have really missed meeting my friends there. I hope to make it next year. It always has the feel of a festival, if there were tents and bad sanitation it would be exactly like it.</p>                                                  <p>A few weeks ago I had to compare two bank account numbers and before I knew what I had done I wrote </p>
<p>perl -e 'if ("0123456789" eq "0123456789"){print "yes"};' </p>                                                                                 <p>on the command line. It did not dawn until later what this meant. It means that having bludgeoned my brain with so much Perl it has eventually and begrudgingly given up and decided to come along with me for the ride and even started to think in it without telling me. It just let its gaurd down and it slipped out.</p></p>
