I was a little delayed in my work this week ($work and fun stuff) because
my SVK repository got really screwy and wouldn't let me push changes back
for certain branches. So I took a whole lot of time troubleshooting that
and then finally just deleting everything and starting my svk mirrors all
over again.
</p>
<p>
After that I was able to jump right back into the gutting of the XML stuff
from smolder in favor or plain ol' TAP. This went pretty smoothly and I was
able to get a nice an intial implementation working, so I committed it back
to the svn repo. I was a little pressed for time, so the test suite is still
broken, but that shouldn't take too much time to get into order.
</p>
<p>
While working with the code that I haven't touched in a while, I noticed a lot
of other areas (not related to my grant work) that could use some sprucing up
too. Plus there's lot of new tricks and tips I've picked up from my work on
other stuff (mostly the AJAXification of
<a href="http://krang.sf.net">Krang</a>) that would be useful for smolder to.
But I guess that's the way it goes. There's always something to learn and
never enough time to backport those learnings to earlier projects.
