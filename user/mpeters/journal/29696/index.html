<div class="span8">
<p><p>How many of you have heard of "downlevel-revealed conditional comments" in HTML. Of course you haven't. It's something that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/overview/ccomment_ovw.asp">Microsoft made up</a>. They look like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
  <![if IE]>stuff<![endif]>;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>This means that <em>stuff</em> will only show up in IE browsers &lt; 5.0.
</p>

<p>It's bad enough that they have "downlevel-hidden conditional comments", but at least those look like normal comments.
</p>

<blocklevel><pre>
   <!--[if !IE gte 6]>stuff<![endif]-->
</pre></blocklevel>

<p>This means that <em>stuff</em> will only show up in IE 6+. While this is a great way for MS to increase their market share by encouraging markup that only works in IE, at least it doesn't break anything in other browsers since it actually is a valid comment.
</p>
<p><em>Why does this matter?</em> I'm currently working on a $project where the audience can be using some pretty crufty browsers. We want to provide some eye-candy to those with modern browsers and just prevent those with broken browsers from getting all those annoying JS pop-up boxes with errors. The designer decides to use "downlevel-hidden conditional comments" to hide it from IE 5 and IE(mac). This works ok until we notice that on pages with forms it's broken. That's because we were using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?HTML::FillInForm">HTML::FillInForm</a> (one of my favorite modules) which is based on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?HTML::Parser">HTML::Parser</a>. HTML::Parser is smart enough to recognize those funny IE comments as comments, which is helpful. However, it does not treat them any differently than any other comments. So when HTML::FillInForm is creating the final document, it reads in a comment and then outputs a comment. Sounds like the right thing to do, except this breaks those funny IE comments because they now come out looking like normal comments.
</p>
<p>The solution? I hacked up a quick sublcass of HTML::FillInForm for the project that will do-the-right thing when it encounters those little suckers. All I had to do was override the <code>comment</code> sub. So in case anyone else needs to use it, here it is:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
sub comment {
    my ( $self, $text ) = @_;
    # if it begins with '[if ' and doesn't end with '<![endif]'
    # it's a "downlevel-revealed" conditional comment (stupid IE)
    # or
    # if it ends with '[endif]' then it's the end of a
    # "downlevel-revealed" conditional comment (stupid IE)
    if(
        (
            ( index($text, '[if ') == 0 )
            &&
            ( $text !~ /<!\[endif\]$/ )
        )
        ||
        ( $text eq '[endif]' )
    ) {
        $self->{output} .= '<!' . $text . '>';
    } else {
        $self->{output} .= '<!--' . $text . '-->';
    }
}
</pre></blockquote></p>

It looks like this fix would help with ENTITY and other declarations in pages with custom DTD info at the top.<br><br>I would definitely submit a patch to RT for this fix.
