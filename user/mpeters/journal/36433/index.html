<h1>LD_LIBRARY_PATH trick</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>I have this problem a lot. I need to link some Perl module against some C library that is not in the standard system libs. Usually this is because it's a locally installed C thingy (like Swish-e or some payment processor API) that I don't want to pollute the system install. Plus it's nice and easy if the whole application is all bundled together.
<br><br>
The easy way to do this is to set the <code>$ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}</code> from your shell to point to the right place. But this is a bother, and not to mention really hard to do if you need some dynamic bits to figure out what the right path is.
<br><br>
And for security reasons, programs can't set their own local version of <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> and have it be respected by the system's loader. It has to be done by the calling process (in most cases the shell).
<br><br>
This little trick let's a script set it's own <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> by relaunching the same program with the same arguments as a new sub-process. Simply put a <code>BEGIN</code> block like this in your script:
<br><br/><br/><pre>
BEGIN {
    if(! $ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} ) {
        $ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} = join(':', @some_paths_I_need);
        my $self_cmd = "$^X $0 " . join(' ', @ARGV);
        system($self_cmd);
        exit;
    }
}<br/><br/></pre>
</p>

otherwise the shell might hose you.

<p>Might? With that broken <code>join</code> I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s a certainty that at some point the shell <em>will</em> hose him. Plus it&#8217;s less and simpler code:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>BEGIN {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; if(! $ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} ) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} = join(':', @some_paths_I_need);<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; system($^X, $0, @ARGV);<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exit;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>}</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>Also: why <code>system(...); exit</code> and not <code>exec</code>?</p>

Just out of curiousity, why is that join broken?<br><br>Also, I didn't use exec because I didn't know how the security restrictions around LD_LIBRARY_PATH were enforced. Using exec means the process continues to have the same pid, system gives me an entirely new process. I wasn't sure if having the same pid would allow me to do what I wanted to do.<br><br>But thanks for the clarification. It works correctly (at least on the Linux machine I tried it on).

<p><blockquote> <div><p>why is that join broken?</p></div> </blockquote>

<p>Because you&#8217;re not shell-quoting anything. If there happens to be any space in there, the new copy of the script will have different <code>@ARGV</code> contents. That&#8217;s before we even get to other shell meta-characters.</p>

You're right about using the list. I was actually debugging it to make sure the command was what I wanted it to be so I was combining it into a string so I could print it to the screen before executing. I just forgot to change it after the fact.
