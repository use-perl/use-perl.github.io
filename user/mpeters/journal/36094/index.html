<p>Smolder 1.21 has just been released thanks to the Oslo Perl QA Workshop and my
trip sponsored by Oslo.pm and Linpro (Linpro was an amazing host for this event. They gave us free reign of their offices for the whole weekend, free food, drinks and travel). This releases fixes several installation
bugs on various platforms and other small bugs. It also adds several new
features. The highlights are:<br/><br/>+ Project categories have now been replaced by the more flexible smoke report tags
+  TAP archives can now be downloaded through the UI for a given report
+ Graphs can now be done on test run duration if that info was provided in the
archive. This was inspired by Ovid's work on the BBC's test suite's run time.
+ The default DB-Platform is now SQLite instead of MySQL<br/><br/>See the changle log for full details.
http://sourceforge.net/projects/smolder<br/><br/>I was also pretty heavily involved in the group working on the next version of TAP. I have to say that this gave me a new appreciation for standards committees. It's really hard to balance extensibility, backwards compatability and ease of use. Especially with TAP since one of it's goals is being extremely human readable. We definitely made some progress and all of the new, slightly less readable features are completely optional so if authors don't want to use them, they don't have to. But Smolder is going to have fun with all this new information coming it's way!</p>
