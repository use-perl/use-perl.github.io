<p><P>
So all this work on the Perl 6 metamodel has made me really, <I>really</I>, <B><I>really</I></B> want some of the Perl 6 OO features in Perl 5. In particular things like opaque instances, inherited attributes and a sane method resolution order under multiple inheritance (C3).
</P>
<P>
Autrijus recently <A HREF="http://use.perl.org/user/autrijus/journal/26127">recomended</A> I give <A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/user/dconway/Class-Std/">Class::Std</A> a try, since it provides many Perl6-ish features. And this morning, I did just that, and I was quite happy to find not only opaque instances (using inside-out objects), but inherited attributes as well as inherited destructors and multiply dispatching methods. 
</P>
<P>
Now, being someone who actually likes to read code, I decided to go source-diving. And this being a Damian module, I was prepared for plenty of the insane code which Damian is known for. But much to my suprise, I found the code quite readable and  very straightfoward.
</P>
<P>
I was happy to see that the BUILD and DESTROY orders are not the standard Perl 5 depth-first/left-to-right orderings. But instead use a custom ordering which seems to produce a fairly sane ordering. And it also seemed that the multple dispatch mechanisms and AUTOMETH feature used the same order as well.
</P>
<P>
However, I did not like the fact that these orderings stood in contrast with the way methods were actually dispatched. The standard Perl 5 method dispatch was still used for standard method dispatch.  So after some head scratching and a little experimentation, I came up with <A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/user/stevan/Class-C3/">Class::C3</A>.
</P>
<P>
While still highly experimental, <A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/user/stevan/Class-C3/">Class::C3</A> is quickly evolving, and version 0.02 should available at a CPAN mirror near you very soon. It basically pre-caches all the method dispatch to insure that the C3 method resolution ordering will be used. Version 0.02 also supports re-initializing the dispatch cache as well for those crazy people who like to mess with @ISA during runtime. I have yet to actually test it with <A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/user/dconway/Class-Std/">Class::Std</A> yet, but I suspect the two modules will get along well.
