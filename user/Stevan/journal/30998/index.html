I recently hacked together a very basic <a href="http://www.iinteractive.com/cgi-bin/class_mop_browser/">Smalltalk-esque class browser</a> for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/stevan/Class-MOP/">Class::MOP</a>. This is really just a basic proof of concept, and it was pretty simple to build, in fact, <a href="http://code2.0beta.co.uk/moose/svn/Class-MOP/trunk/scripts/class_browser.pl">it is pretty much all TT code</a>. (My CSS and HTML skills are sorely lacking, so my apologies if it looks really bad). 
</p>
<p>
Of course being a proof of concept, it has many caveats. To start with, it needs the <a href="http://code2.0beta.co.uk/moose/svn/Class-MOP/trunk/">bleeding edge (svn) version of Class::MOP</a>. It does not yet work well with Moose either (this is because the latest Moose is not yet synced up with the bleeding edge Class::MOP). 
</p>
<p>
But it is not all bad news :) it does some really cool stuff as well. 
To start with, it is not just restircted to Class::MOP and Moose classes. Because Class::MOP is meant to also be able to introspect vanilla Perl OO, it can be used to browse those classes as well. And if you are using Moose or Class::MOP, the browser simply loads all the metaclasses in Class::MOP's metaclass cache, so as long as you load your classes, they will appear in the browser.
</p>
<p>
The eventual goal is to make this into a more full featured class browser, with full support for both Moose and non-Moose classes & possibly also including documentation (parsed from the POD).  But anyway, enough babbling, back to $work for now.

This is quite sexy. And I rather like how it looks.



<h2>Impressive</h2>

Really quite impressive!<br><br>I have no idea how you wrote it. If I had written it, I'd have walked the stashes and went from there. But then, how do you manage to extract the code for specific methods? B::Deparse? Or do you parse the sources themselves?<br><br>Steffen

<a href="http://code2.0beta.co.uk/moose/svn/Class-MOP/trunk/scripts/class_browser.pl" title="0beta.co.uk">Here</a 0beta.co.uk> is the code, it simply uses Class::MOP's introspection rather than walking the stashes, and yes, the method bodies are feed to B::Deparse.

Mostly those pages are being created from structured data...<br><br>I really can't help but wonder what sort of magical things you could do with a combination of something like the Display.Only and Jemplate JSAN modules.<br><br>Send all the data down the pipe at once, and then just render the inline bits client-side<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>
