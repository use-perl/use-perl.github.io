One of the biggest complaints/problems with Moose has always been it's compile time cost. Well with the newest release of Moose (0.33) and Class::MOP (0.49) we have made a major step towards reducing that. With judicious use of XS (konobi++ for that) and some caching in key parts of Class::MOP we have managed to <B>cut Moose load time almost in half</B>, here are the stats from my machine (MacBook Pro w/ 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo).

Moose 0.32 & Class::MOP 0.48 => 0.46 real  0.43 user  0.02 sys
<BR>
Moose 0.33 & Class::MOP 0.49 => 0.27 real  0.22 user  0.02 sys

<P>
This change also brings allowed us to take advantage of some 5.10 specific improvements as well. In 5.8.* we use the PL_sub_generation interpreter global to determine when to invalidate our method cache, which was one of the big parts of the speed win. In 5.8.* this is incremented every time a package is changed, which means we were probably invalidating our cache even when we didn't need to. Now in 5.10 we are using the mro::get_pkg_gen function, which provides the same feature but increments on a per-package basis, which means less incorrect cache invalidation.

<P>
All in all, not bad for a few hours of work by the folks on #moose.

<B>NOTE:</B> I got my stats wrong in the ChangeLogs, I called it a ~45% speed increase, but it is really 45% less slow.

<h2>Correct use of ratio percentages</h2>

Come now, we agreed in IRC that the correct way to express the difference was 63% more fastyness.

I think that would be either "63% more fasting" or "50% less gluttony."

<h2>Cool</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davegaramond/">davegaramond</a> on 2007-12-15T02:40:36</h3>
That's really cool. I'm starting to use Moose in some of my applications, but still hesitate using it in CGI (non-FastCGI) scripts, due to that +- 0.20 secs overhead which is still very heavy. Anyway, keep up the great work!

A major reason for this recent efforts to cut startup time is actually because we are working with Max Kanat-Alexander (of <a href="http://www.everythingsolved.com/services/#bugzilla" title="everythingsolved.com">Bugzilla</a everythingsolved.com> fame) to try and get Moose fast enough to be used in the refactoring/rewriting of Bugzilla. Max is already a fan of Moose and has used it on his (very cool) "All your VCS are belong to us" module <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/VCI/" title="cpan.org">VCI</a cpan.org> module. I suspect that by mid-spring you will be able to deploy Moose apps under vanilla-CGI without a worry.

This looks like a good start, keep the fastyness improvements coming.<br><br>Then maybe one day Moose::Tiny may actually be able to compete with Object::Tiny<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Well, we will never beat you on memory usage, but I feel I must remind you that Moose::Tiny is 8% shorter to type than Object::Tiny<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
</p><p><p>
Also, we are really breathing down your neck with our accessors (from the Moose::Tiny POD):</p><p><blockquote> <div><tt>&nbsp; Benchmarking accessors...<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rate moose&nbsp; tiny<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; moose 485/s&nbsp; &nbsp; --&nbsp; -19%<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; tiny&nbsp; 599/s&nbsp; &nbsp;23%&nbsp; &nbsp; --</tt></div> </blockquote> And reallly, the difference in speed here is simply because Moose::Tiny checks to make sure you don't try and use the read-only accessors to assign a value with, whereas Object::Tiny simply swallows the value silently without even a simple <code>warn "RTFM!"</code>.

<p>
On a more serious side, we have also been experimenting with a module we are calling MooseX::Compile. It does two things really, 1) it caches the generated meta-objects with Storable and only loads them if you ask for them and 2) writes out the accessors, constructors and destructors that we 'eval' in Moose into a<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.pm and/or<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.pmc file. The proof of concept prototype that we put together actually loaded as fast as our hand-coded-plain-old-vanilla-perl control file (something like 0.01s), and was actually pretty good in terms of memory usage (not on the scale of Object::Tiny of course, but hey, you can't win them all). This module will also offer (at least) two options for compilation, a first-time-compile penalty which writes out the PMC for you, or an install-time penalty which will allow you to deploy your module on CPAN in it's compiled form. And I saved the best for last too, since Moose is a meta-circular system, it should be possible to actually turn the MooseX::Compile goodness on Moose itself!

<p>
So, as the saying goes, its not the size that matters but how you use it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
