<div class="span8">
<p><P>
The latest release of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/stevan/Moose-0.34/">Moose</a> (0.34) brings with it some very nice features as well as a major re-factoring of the role system (I am finally happy with the design now too) and a re-factoring of the parameterized types. While most of the information on the new features is in the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/STEVAN/Moose-0.34/Changes">Changes</a> file, I figured that they are cool enough to be blog-worthy too, so here goes.
</P>
<P>
<b>New Maybe[`a] parameterized type</b>
</P>
<P>
The handling of parameterized types has been re-factored so that it is now possible to add new parameterized types without needing them to be based off the ArrayRef or HashRef type (no syntactic sugar yet though). As a demonstration of this, and because it's just a useful thing anyway I have added the Maybe[`a] type. This type basically means "maybe there will be a value, and if there is, it will be of type `a", users of Haskell will be familiar with this (as will O'Caml users, it is similar to the 'option' type). Here is an example of the usage:
</P>
<ECODE>
package Person;
use Moose;<br/><br/>has 'first_name'     => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Str');
has 'last_name'      => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Str');
has 'middle_initial' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Maybe[Str]');
</ECODE>
<P>
The 'middle_initial' attribute now allows either a string or an undefined value to be stored.
</P>
<P>
<b>Role method exclusion and aliasing</b>
</P>
<P>
Role composition follows a strictly defined set of rules, this is one of the benefits of roles over your basic mix-ins or multiple inheritance. But sometimes, you want to subvert those rules and have more control over the composition process. The <a href="http://www.iam.unibe.ch/user/scg/Research/Traits/">original Traits paper</a> (on which Roles are based) included both 'exclusion' and 'aliasing' operations as a way of modifying the composition process. I included these features when I originally wrote <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-Trait/">Class::Trait</a>, but since @larry had not added them into Perl 6 I hadn't included support in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/stevan/Moose-0.34/">Moose</a>. Now after several months of using Roles I now see the original wisdom of the Traits paper authors and these features are now available in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/stevan/Moose-0.34/">Moose</a>. Here are some examples of usage:
</P>
<P>
Lets create an Equality role, which provides the mechanism for determining, well, equality.
<ECODE>
package Equality;
use Moose::Role;<br/><br/>requires 'equal';
sub not_equal { not((shift)->equal(@_)) }
</ECODE>
Now lets define two more roles which do the Equality role, first a 'HasColor' role:
<ECODE>
package HasColor;
use Moose::Role;<br/><br/>with 'Equality';<br/><br/># create an attribute to hold RGB values
has 'rgb' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'ArrayRef[Int]');<br/><br/>sub equal { ... code to compare RBG values ... }
</ECODE>
And now a 'HasCoordinate' role
<ECODE>
package HasCoordinate;
use Moose::Role;<br/><br/>with 'Equality';<br/><br/># create an attribute to hold x/y values
has 'coord' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'ArrayRef[Int]');<br/><br/>sub equal { ... code to compare x/y values ... }
</ECODE>
Now if my 'Pixel' class wanted to use both the 'HasColor' and 'HasCoordinate' roles, ...
<ECODE>
package Pixel;
use Moose;<br/><br/>with 'HasColor', 'HasCoordinate';
</ECODE>
I would have a problem because their 'equal' methods would conflict. The conflict means that the 'Pixel' class must then implement an 'equal' method of it's own. I could implement it like so:
<ECODE>
sub equal {
    my ($self, $other) = @_;
    $self->HasColor::equal($other) && 
    $self->HasCoordinate::equal($other);
}
</ECODE>
but the hardcoding of role names like this is a design smell IMO. We also have lost color and coordinate comparison abilities in our 'Pixel' class. Here is a different approach using exclusion and aliasing to provide (IMO) a much superior solution.
</P>
<ECODE>
package Pixel;
use Moose;<br/><br/>with 'HasColor' => { 
        excludes => 'equal', 
        alias    => { equal => 'color_equal' }
     },
     'HasCoordinate' => { 
        excludes => 'equal', 
        alias    => { equal => 'coord_equal' }
     };<br/><br/>sub equal {
    my ($self, $other) = @_;
    $self->color_equal($other) && $self->coord_equal($other);
}
</ECODE>
<P>
The above code now removes the conflict between the 'equal' methods, but aliases them so that the features are not lost and finally implements equals in terms of them. 
</P>
<P>
Of course this example is a little on the contrived side, but you get the point. Anyone who has messed around with roles enough will surely rejoice at this new feature addition.
</P>
<P>
<b>Attribute Metaclass traits</b>
</P>
<P>
We already have support for custom attribute metaclasses and this feature is used in a number of modules, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-Getopt/">MooseX::Getopt</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-Storage/">MooseX::Storage</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-AttributeHelpers/">MooseX::AttributeHelpers</a> to name a few. It allows you to extend the features of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/stevan/Moose-0.34/">Moose</a> attributes to provide additional functionality within the same <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/stevan/Moose-0.34/">Moose</a> framework. The one problem with this feature has always been that it is very difficult to combine these extensions and use more than one at a time. Here is a (very contrived) example of how this feature will be useful.
</P>
<ECODE>
package My::App;
use Moose;
use MooseX::Storage;
use MooseX::Getopt;<br/><br/>has 'some_thing' => (
    traits => [qw/DoNotSerialize NoGetopt/],
    is     => 'rw',
    isa    => 'ArrayRef[Big::Heavy::Things]',
    # ...
);
</ECODE>
<P>
Currently <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-Storage/">MooseX::Storage</a> provides a DoNotSerialize metaclass which lets the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-Storage/">MooseX::Storage</a> engine know to skip that attribute when serializing. This is fine, until you need to also use the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-Getopt/">MooseX::Getopt</a> provided NoGetopt metaclass (which, yes you guessed it, tells <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-Getopt/">MooseX::Getopt</a> that this is not a command line parameter). I will soon be releasing versions of those two modules which will make the above example work, allowing you to easily combine both non-serialization with non-getopt-parsing. (Sorry, that was the best example I could come up with right now, we are working on a possible cookbook entry so if this interests you keep you eyes out).
</P>
<P>
<b>And lastly ...</b>
</P>
<P>
And lastly, in addition to all this new functionality, I would like to announce the upcoming release of MooseX::Compile 0.01 (possibly by tomorrow morning). MooseX::Compile is a project here at $work which takes all the stored meta-information of a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/stevan/Moose-0.34/">Moose</a> class and compiles a .pmc file which defers loading the bulk of the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/stevan/Moose-0.34/">Moose</a> infrastructure and caches the already computed metaclasses. It is still in it's very early stages, and only supports a subset of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/stevan/Moose-0.34/">Moose</a>, but results are extremely promising. 
</P>
