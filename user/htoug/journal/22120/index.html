<p>I've just wasted nearly a whole week chasing a wierd bug in DB_File (or so it seemed at first).<p>
We have a number of Alphas running Tru64 (about 20) and our home directory is NFS-mounted on all the machines (so you have your files with you everywhere).<p>The web-development Alphas have just beeen upgraded from Tru64 v4.0G to v5.1B - the server people did a clean install, so as to remove any lint collected over the years.<br>I had sync'ed /usr/local (with out perl environment and other tools) from the Perforce depository and tested.<br>Everthing was OK.<br>The machines were released to the users and everyone seemed happy until the guy on the table next to me said that his Apache::ASP setup acted strangely, it crashed whenever he fiddled with the $Session-variable in his scripts.<br>"Hmmm...." I said. "I'll have a look at that". Famous last words.<p>
The apache server crashed with a segmentation violation deep down inside Apache::ASP's internals - I finally tracked it down to a call to DB_File.<br>"No problem - I'll just upgrade DB_File" I thought - perhaps something has broken in the upgrade - so a recompilation might be called for.<br>
Download the latest DB_File, and do <tt>Perl Makefile.PL</tt>, <tt>make test</tt> and <em>boom</em> DB_File fails in its tests.<p>
Wierd - DB_File shouldn't SEGV.<p>
Check rt.cpan.org for known bugs: I found one, where someone reported that the version of the underlying BerkeleyDB delivered with Tru64 v5.1B had a bug.<p>
Download the latest berkeleyDB, compile and install. Retest DB_File: still <em>boom</em>.<p>
Now I'm getting desperate. One of out test-machines runs the same Apache::ASP application as originally gave the error, so I looked there and everything semed ok - it was at a lower patchlevel than the dev.box but otherwise the same.<br>I tested DB_File on that: <em>boom</em>, hmmmm....<p>
I looked in the DB_File code, and it seems that it sends a wrong argument to the db_del function - deep down in a macro in an XS-file. I wanted to make a small test-case, so that I could see if that was the error. So I headed back to BerkeleyDB, and looked for example code.<br>A the README passed over my screen something about 'NFS' caught my eye.<p>
<blockquote>* To run the test harness for this module, you must make sure that the
      directory where you have untarred this module is NOT a network
      drive, e.g. NFS or AFS.
</blockquote>
I was doing all this in my 'work' subdirectory to my home - which is NFS mounted!<p>
Move over to /tmp and try again.<p>
Everything works!<p>
It seems that Tru64 v4.0G had an undocumented feature that allowed BerkeleyDB files to be on an NFS-mounted filesystem. This feature has been removed in v5.1B.<p>
Once again the lesson is: when debugging, take your time. Check <i>every</i> step, and do read the READMEs - don't assume that you can remember it from last you installed, things may have changed.<p>
The fix was to move Apache::ASP's session-state files away from the home directory tree to somewhere in /tmp, and everyone is happy.</p>

<i>when debugging, take your time</i> <p>

a rule we all know but don't apply sometimes or worst most of the time. the same can be applied to day to day life.
i don't remember how many times i have relearned that rule. Doh!</p>
