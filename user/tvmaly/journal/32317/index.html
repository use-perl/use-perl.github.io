<p>I have been thinking about writing a new module to write Excel 2003 xml.  The current module Spreadsheet::WriteExcel has is limitations.  For instance, it lacks the ability to insert links to other sheets within the same workbook.  It also lacks the ability to create pivot tables.  I would like it to produce very minimal worksheets.  However, I would like it to be able to add the auto filter, do some minimal styling, and have the ability to add basic formulas.  I will be starting this project sometime next month when the workload slows up a little.  Has anyone else given any thought to a project like this?</p>

Hi,
<p>
Have you seen <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Spreadsheet-WriteExcelXML" title="cpan.org">Spreadsheet::WriteExcelXML</a cpan.org>? If there are some Excel features missing that you want to use, it might be better to hack on this module and send patches to the author rather than starting a new module from scratch.

Cheers,

I think you should look more closely at Spreadsheet::WriteExcel before cranking up a new project: it can certainly do some of the things that you claim it lacks. For example, to write an internal link (to a sheet called $s_name using format $format)...<br><br>my $contents = $ss-&gt;sheets(0);<br>$contents-&gt;write($row,$col,"internal:$s_name!A1",$s_name,$format);<br><br>It can also write simple formulas with ease (see the documentation). Pivot tables and autofilter aren't available however (the latter is on the TODO list), unless something's changed *very* recently.<br><br>

I would highly recommend working with John McNamara  to improve one of the existing modules, rather than reinventing the wheel just to put on white walls. He is one of the good ones.<br><br>I know it can be frustrating to find a feature missing or implemented inconveniently in a module, but if you branch or reinvent, take a look at the mail list to see what you are taking on!  Even a branching would introduce such version skew to keep up with, my God!<br><br>
