    What's with these Ringwraiths, dissing my Shire?<br>
    Why do they gotta front?<br>
    What did we ever do to these guys<br>
    That made them so violent?<br>
    My-pre-cious, but you know I'm yours<br>
    My-pre-cious, and I know you're mine<br>
    My-pre-cious, and that's for all time<br>
<p>
    Oo-ee-oo I look just like Bilbo Hobbit<br>
    Oh-oh, and you're Galadriel<br>
    I don't care what they say about this stupid ring<br>
    I don't care bout that<br>
<p>
    Don't you ever fear, I'm always near<br>
    I know that you need help<br>
    Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit<br>
    You need Gandalf the Grey<br>
    My-pre-cious, but you know I'm yours<br>
    My-pre-cious, and I know you're mine<br>
    My-pre-cious, and that's for all time<br>

    I don't care bout that<br>
<p>
    Bang, bang a knock on the door<br>
    Another big bang and you're down on the floor<br>
    Oh no! How do we feel?<br>
    Don't look now but I missed my meal<br>
    I can't run and I can't kick<br>
    What's a matter Bor' are you feeling sick?<br>
    what's a matter, what's a matter, what's a matter you?<br>
    What's a matter Bor', are you feeling blue? oh-oh!<br>

    My name is Frodo<br>
    I'm carrying the ring<br>
    Thanks for all who've read us<br>
    But now we're in movies!<br>
    Come sit next to me<br>
    Pour yourself some tea<br>
    Just like Bilbo made<br>
    Before he ever found rings<br>
    Things were better then<br>
    Once but never again<br>
    We've all left the den<br>
    Let me tell you 'bout it<br>
<p> 
    The Fellowship left right on time<br>
    Ringbearing costs only your mind<br>
    The Wizard said, 'Hey man, we go all the way'<br>
    Of course we were willing to pay<br>
<p> 
    Our name is Smeagol<br> 
    We gotta pocket full of your fishes<br>
    They're fresh out of water<br>
    But they're still makin' wishes (makin' wishes)<br>
    Tell us what to do<br>
    Now that Orcs have come --<br>
    Now with Elephants!<br>
    And you know what else?<br>
    Guess what we received<br>
    Out of Mordor today<br>
    Words of deep concern<br>
    From my little pressioussesss<br>
<p> 
    In Rohan it's not going as we planned<br>
    Their warlord has fallen betranced<br>
    The great Ents will not clear a path<br>
    The wizard swears he learned his math<br>
<p> 
    The Uruk-hai are leaving home<br>
    The Uruk-hai are leaving home<br>
    The Uruk-hai are leaving home<br>
    The Uruk-hai are leaving home<br>
    No!<br>
<p> 
    The Uruk-hai are leaving home<br>
    The Uruk-hai are leaving home<br>
    The Uruk-hai are leaving home<br>
    No! No! No!<br>
<p> 
    My name is Frodo<br>

Anna okay I'll stop now :-)
<p>Really though, I think I would have actually liked all the singing bits in LOTR if they'd been done to some kind of crunchy AC-DC/Ramones/Weezer guitars. Nevermind the Boll^H^H^H^HZeppelin, a quick glance at Weezer's lyrics shows lots of places for funny LOTR riffs... :-)</p>
