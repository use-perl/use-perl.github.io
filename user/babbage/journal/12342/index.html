<h2>Rhetorical Beat-Down</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2003-05-21T16:47:31</h3>
<blockquote><div> <em>Can we please...</em> </div></blockquote>

<p>This phrase flips several of my bozo bits (I've a whole double word full of them).    I tend to hear it as "Here's something I want.  You should do it."</p>

<p>It's often better phrased as "why don't you".  The nice thing about the resulting sentence (<em>Why don't you finish Perl 6 already?</em>) is that the intent is obvious.</p>

Sorry, it was meant in an entirely friendly &amp; cheerful way -- wasn't trying to push any buttons or flip any bozo bits.

<p>The joke, which apparently fell flat (or is about to once it has been overexplained), is that Perl6 has hit several development obstacles, but now that Buffy is off the air, the biggest of these impediments has been removed...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p><p>That, and while I'm not such a great programmer, I would still like to help along the development of Perl6 is some way. So when I say "can we", I <i>am</i> including myself in that -- I don't want to coerce others to do it all, I'd like to help too. So the intent wasn't "here's something I want, <i>you</i> should do it," but "here's something I want, <i>we</i> should all help do it.

</p><p>Clearer?</p>

<p>That's fair, but you have to admit that <em>The Two Towers</em> DVD will be coming out soon, along with Farscape season two boxed set and, hopefully, Babylon 5 season three.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Good thing the core team is not -- I hope -- into reality shows: it could be years before we got them to pay attention again...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
