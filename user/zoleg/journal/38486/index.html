<p>Thought has been experimented with and discussed regarding it's possibility and it's potential for well over 50 years. Do our thoughts affect our environment? Is thought, in fact, our environment and is it the only area where free choice exists?<br/><br/>It turns out that the power of our thoughts are precisely how we may influence Nature. (BTW Nature and the Creator are interchangeable.) It is our one and only way to intervene with  the grand plan - that is the path of humanity. Of course, it goes both ways and the other side of our influence is met with the same influence we caused and altered.<br/><br/>If all of us together direct our thoughts toward goodness, we will change our fate. Right now everyone puts themselves first. We end up with many individual, random thoughts that are not powerful because we use them against each other... As we know: 'like energy does not attract,' in this case and therefore the thoughts cannot join into one good thought. This is where our choice comes in. We can use individual thought that will realize mutually destructive consequences or we can converge our common, good thought toward a peaceful and natural outcome for Humanity. <br/><br/>In other words, NatureÃ¢â¬â¢s (the CreatorÃ¢â¬â¢s) Plan is not biased. Our development is neutral in and of itself. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s actually us who improve and accelerate, or, on the contrary, delay and worsen Its influence on us with our desires, thoughts, and intentions. We yield the outcome of our path to complete our predetermined destiny. The 'How' of this direction is in our thoughts. In other words our entire choice lies in choosing which road to take: the short and good path, or the lengthy and evil one.</p>

This seems to be some kind of spam. Google <a href="http://www.google.nl/search?q=%22Thought+has+been+experimented+with%22&amp;hl=nl&amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enNL244NL244&amp;filter=0" title="google.nl">"Thought has been experimented with"</a google.nl> and you'll see this has been posted on a lot of places.
