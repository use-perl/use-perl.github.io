<p><p>
  Wonderful party yesternight at <a href='http://jazzvalley.com/'>JazzValley</a>. At some point a friend introduced me to a bunch of people and one girl in the group said "ah I've seen you, you're the guy that's been carrying bottle of champagne around all evening".
</p>
<p>
  And indeed there was champagne there, lots of it.
</p>

<p>
  There was also some very good music as you can imagine. They had a jam session with very good musicians, and amazing singers. Unfortunately I had to leave at some point, so I wonder if Eric got to play. He plays the piano really well as those that heard him at TPC last year will no doubt attest.
</p>

<p>
  This is going to be yet another very productive day if I can judge from the speed at which my brain seems to be processing information. My current schedule shows a party every other day until the 21rst... I'm afraid that if I keep that pace going, I'll be able to pretend I'm on IRC by piping Eliza there before the end of the month.
</p>

<p>
  Oh well, I'm about to turn 25 so chances are my neurons are starting to rot away at an increased pace anyway, I might as well help a little ;-)
