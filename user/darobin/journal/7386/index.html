  Oooh, I like those new little icons! Is that the first step towards exporting <a href='http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/'>FOAF</a> files from use.perl? For a sample document: <a href='http://robin.berjon.com/foaf.rdf'>my FOAF file</a>.

<h2>Graphical fofofs maps</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rafael/">rafael</a> on 2002-08-29T10:02:32</h3>
I wondered once if it would be possible to produce a graphical map of use.perl friends or fans, centered at an arbitrary user, with a specified "radius". However I've no idea which tool to use to produce such a topological map. (and is there a more computer friendly version of the <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/rafael/friends/" title="perl.org">friends page</a perl.org>?)

Sounds like a job for graphviz (and probably LWP to extract the details).

<p>Actually, I  wrote a while ago this kind of script, but it crashed my box every time I tried to launch it... If anyone is willing to give it a try, it's available <a href="http://briac.net/use.perl_friends.pl" title="briac.net">here</a briac.net>.</p>

  As Matt said, so long as you can extract the data it's probably a job at which GraphViz would excel (especially using its nice Perl interface<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;).
</p>

<p>
  There is no more computer friendly version of the friends page that I know of (except the db behind it of course) but there was talk a few months ago of adding SOAP support to the Zoo. It shouldn't be too hard for anyone that knows a little about Slash (and even someone that doesn't). I might do it if I have the time (which could be whenever...). That being said, the friends page isn't all that hard to parse either.

And was this produced with GraphViz ? (which looks great anyway -- ) Producing a readable layout may be challenging due to the amount of data.

That was produced by a perl layout engine I hacked up that I don't own the rights to, which uses GD (for truetype fonts), Graphics::Libplot (for bezier lines), and Image::Magick to glue the two together.

<p>Back then, Libplot had troubles outputting<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.png, and GD had trouble reading them, so Image::Magick did a<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.gif -&gt;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.png conversion for me.  What a hack.  I offered to hire Thomas Boutell to put beziers into GD (was too time constrained myself at the time), but he wasn't interested.

</p><p>GraphViz handles tree shaped digraphs and undirected graphs, and its output does not map to a circular layout very well.  In an early prototype I tried warping a graphviz layout and drawing the result myself: ugh. Also, GraphViz generates confusing graphs for large data sets, though I do use it a lot.  Just wrote another module that uses it a few weeks ago in fact.  It's good at showing smallish (less than a few 100 nodes, say) opcode trees and SCM controlled file branching.  it offers limited support for pinning nodes where you want them, though, and for controlling the layout easily.

</p><p>I'd love to get a contract to build a better version of that layout engine using, say, Imager.pm, but it's not likely.</p>
