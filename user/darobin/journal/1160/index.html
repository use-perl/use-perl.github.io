  While thinking about Exceptions, the fact that 
  <a href='http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Error'>Error.pm</a> 
  can lead you to create closures if you don't pay close 
 attention, the fact that however cool a Filter based 
 Error module would force people to put it on the first 
 line of every app that uses its exceptions (at least, if
 I've understood filters properly), and various other 
 things (such as the problems Kip Hampton and I ran into
 recently due to the globalness of $@ which makes Perl
 exception rather brittle), I came to the conclusion
 that maybe the simplest solution would be to stick with
 Error.pm more or less as it is, but to have a way to be
 warned about created closures.
</p>

<p>
 In fact, it would be useful beyond Error.pm. Closures are
 generally a bad idea for instance in mod_perl as they'll 
 generate all sorts of memory leaks.
</p>

<p>
 I have no idea how to detect the creation of a closure in
 Perl, but there must be a way as Perl itself probably
 knows that it's a closure. A simple Devel::Closure module
 could then be created, and with it a way to warn (or die,
 or call a callback, or... raise an exception) when a
 closure is created.
</p>

<p>
 Anyone with the knowledge of how to do that is very 
 welcome to release such a module :-) Of course, pointing
 me to information that would allow me to figure it out
 by myself would also be very welcome.
