  After having received my shiny new laundry/dryer machine, I couldn't wait to get it to run my first batch of clothes. I was all excited, opened a bottle of wine, a nice pack of cigarettes, and placed stuff on the kitchen floor so that I could sit there and watch it run.
</p>

<p>
  But it didn't go quite that smoothly. Apparently operating that kind of machinery requires some university degree which I quite obviously missed.
</p>

<p>
  Now, I'm not technology impaired. I can operate all sorts of machines such as video recorders, cell phones, "EZ-OneTouch" microwave ovens, arty bottle-openers, you name it. I've even been operating laundry machines for over ten years (my parents had one) without the smallest problem.
</p>

<p>
  But facing this one was harder. So hard in fact that on the first run I managed to program it to run the drier before it washed (now if that isn't a braindead option I don't know what is). I was fooled for a while into believing that it was working (albeit a bit weirdly) because it has an internal steam condensing system that spits out water as it dries, so it looked as if something washing-related was going on.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, the fact the instructions manual doesn't match the model doesn't help much.
</p>

<p>
  Thankfully, after a good hour of trying to understand how the model in the instructions worked on the premises that it might have been designed by the same moron that made the interface for mine I managed to reverse engineer it. And it worked very well, YAY !!! I sat for a few hours in front of it (no, I'm not <em>that</em> admirative, I just wanted to be there for the first runs to check that it wasn't leaking or something), with an excellent bottle of wine and wrote songs to the sweet sound of laundry rotating quietly mixed to background radio (I find that radio soup is perfect for 1/ home tasks and 2/ songwriting. Go figure.)
