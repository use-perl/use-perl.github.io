  My good old friend Antoine Quint has started to work as a monthly columnist for xml.com. Every month, he'll be talking about SVG there, so if you're not yet up to speed on this amazing piece of technology, I recommend that you check out his articles. His first column was published today: <a href='http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/01/23/svg/index.html'>http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/01/23/svg/index.html</a>
</p>

<p>
  Another cool thing is that he's to publish on the same day every month as <a href='http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/01/23/perl-schematron.html'>Kip Hampton's</a> delightful column about Perl and XML. Some thursdays are just going to rock.

Seconded.  I expect great things from Mr Quint.  Definitely someone to watch (well, read).  I'm starting to get goosebumps about SVG, as much as I treat XML with equal measures of fear, suspicion, and loathing<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

<p>
  Have you had the chance to meet Antoine? I was lucky enough to hire him for some time in 2000-2001 and he's really someone to watch <em>and</em> read<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
</p>

<p>
  You would better sharpen your anti-XML opinions if you are to voice them before him this summer, he has more energy than a gang of raving elephants... (I should know, I do treat XML with much suspicion and I've had <em>long</em> talks with Antoine).
</p>

<p>
  He lives 100m away from my place, and I must say this is the only district I've lived in where your average barman is now knowledgeable about SVG.
</p>

<p>
  And the cool thing is that this year he'll be old enough to drink in San Diego<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
