  I was really looking forward to meeting a bunch of people at the Open Source CMS Conference, some of which I've known for a while on IRC but have never seen. Unfortunately, reality decided otherwise...
</p>

<p>
  On the day I was to leave, a silly strike (at least I think it was a strike, they didn't bother to explain too much, and weren't clear at all in what little explanation they provided). Because of that I missed the train I was supposed to ride from Paris to Zurich, where the conference was held.
</p>

<p>
  I then tried to get another ticket, even if that meant that I would arrive a bit late. Unfortunately, all the last minute tickets are a lot more expensive than the ones you buy a while before, and with my bank accounts way into the red (and then already about to be cancelled) I couldn't buy another ticket. I would have asked a friend, but most of my friends are hardly in better financial situations than I.
</p>

<p>
  That's a real pity, I really wish I could've been there. Ah well, I guess it'll have to be next year, in Tokyo...
