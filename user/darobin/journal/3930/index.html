  One of my birthday presents was a pair of tickets to go see <a href='http://www.thiefaine.com'>Hubert Felix Thi&egrave;faine</a> in concert at the Bataclan.
</p>

<p>
  Those of you that know HFT might smile, but I listened to his music throughout my teens, and still do now (though in part from nostaligia). For those that don't know him, he's a guy that has poor music and excellent lyrics (most of them rather dark and surreal).
</p>

<p>
  The concert was great. He might be 50 but it certainly doesn't show. It was also rather long (2h30), and his sound was always much better in concert. The cool part with his shows is that everyone knows the lyrics to pretty much all the songs, so that the audience really participate. In short, it was a great evening.

<p>Come on Robin! I am 13 years older than you and I thought HFT was already pass&eacute; when _I_ was a teenager! You have to start listening to some <a href="http://www.officialramones.com/" title="officialramones.com">modern music</a officialramones.com> (this has to be the worst site intro ever!)</p>
