  It quite suddenly dawned on me... the reason I'm so eager for even such a short trip to Sydney is because I miss my <a href='http://www.vegemite.com.au/'>Vegemite</a>! I haven't had a spoon of it in years, having instead to fall back on the lesser Marmite. Yum!
</p>

<p>
  If you don't know what it is, take your first chance to try it. You'll hate it!
</p>

<pre>
We're happy little Vegemites, as bright as bright can be,
We all enjoy our Vegemite for breakfast lunch and tea
Because we love our Vegemite
We all adore our Vegemite
It puts a roooooooose in every cheek!
</pre>

<h2>Vegemite</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2003-01-13T15:41:36</h3>
I've never been to Oz, but I managed to pick up a taste for Vegemite about 10 years ago when I was traveling with some Aussies.
<p>
Whenever I arrive in a new place, I always scour the local area for the little quirky foods I like.  I've <i>always</i> been able to find Vegemite in "large" North American cities.  And I always have a little jar tucked away in the kitchen.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>



<h2>Mail Order</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2003-01-13T17:53:38</h3>
You could get it by mail order. I've loved the stuff ever since a friend in Oz mailed some in a Christmas package. My daughter and some of the neighbor kids like it too. But then, I started them on it after we got a sort of mold out of a Teletubby magazine on our trip to England, so I'd make 'Tubby toast' vegemite sandwiches and they ate'em up.
<p>These days, I don't even have to make it look like Tubby toast, they eat it anyway.
</p><p>Hmm, <a href="http://www.ozchannel.com/vegemite/vegemite.html" title="ozchannel.com">Vegemite Central</a ozchannel.com> is where I used to get it, and they appear to not be there anymore, but they wouldn't ship outside the states anyway.
</p><p>I've just found <a href="http://www.laoutback.net/grocery.html" title="laoutback.net">LA outback</a laoutback.net> and it says they'll ship worldwide...</p>

The 'mold' was a sort of cookie cutter which would cut the bread into a circle and squash a smiley face into it before toasting. Does making vegemite tubby toast make me some kind of heretic?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
