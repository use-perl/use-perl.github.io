  <em>"Many of the survivors were loaded back in the containers with the corpses, then driven to a place in the desert called Dasht-i-Leili. In the presence of up to 40 US special forces, the living and the dead were dumped into ditches. Anyone who moved was shot. The German newspaper Die Zeit investigated the claims and concluded that: "No one doubted that the Americans had taken part. Even at higher levels there are no doubts on this issue. (...) The five soldiers dragged in front of the cameras [a little while ago] should thank their lucky stars that they are prisoners not of the American forces fighting for civilisation, but of the "barbaric and inhuman" Iraqis."</em><br>

<p>While I see no collaboration for any kind of these claims against US soldiers in Afghanistan, just rumors, "a reporter talked to a man...", "nobody doubts..." (nobody confirms either), it should be noted that of the 5 soldiers paraded before Iraqi cameras, only bloody uniforms have been found so far.<br> </p><p>It's also fairly clear that Jennifer Lynch was in the process of long and painful torture when she was rescued.  None of her injuries, which included two broken legs a broken arm and a broken back, were thought to have been inflicted in the battle that led up to her capture.  The Iraqi man who informed the US troops as to her whereabouts witnessed her being slapped around.  I'm sure being slapped around when you have broken bones is quite excrutiating.<br> </p><p>I'm sure there will be reports of American atrocities.  There always are.  You can choose who you want to believe, I guess.  If they can be substantiated, there is a working justice system in the US that could be used to hold them responsible.</p>

War is an atrocity.  The question then becomes, "Does it prevent a worse atrocity?"
<p>
And the only answer anybody seems to have most of the time is "Gee, I hope so."</p>
