  It would seem that the deitys are doing all they can to introduce some extra measures of suspense during what is turning out to be one of the more stressful moments in my (short) life. What with everything I've worked to create for five years hanging off a single contract, this morning we received a completely cryptic five line e-mail from that prospect, most of which read as gibberish and what parseable sentence fragments there were could be read either as "Your proposal was good." or as "Thanks, but we have chosen someone else". Conclusion: he's unreachable today, we'll know tomorrow...
</p>

<p>
  Aaaaah, I feel like banging my head against my desk very hard. As if being awoken with a scream every morning by frightening nightmares at exactly 08:01 wasn't enough to give me a sense of impending doom, now our potential customers start behaving like they're out of a Lynch flick or something.
</p>

<p>
  Something that's been on my mind as well is: If we go bust, do I stay in Paris? Finding a job abroad (preferably in London, as that's where my girlfriend is) could be an interesting change, and might help alleviate the sense of utter defeat a little. Of course, given my financial situation it'd have to be a company that wants me badly enough to pay for the relocation :) Hmmm....

Hmm... that's a very irc comment isn't it. Ah well. Hope it turns out good.
