<p><p>
  I've been planning to get a tatoo for a while. In fact, I've been planning it out rather carefullly. Given the, erm, persistent nature of the operation, it's not the kind of thing one ought to do too lightly.
</p>

<p>
  So I've interrogated all the people I know that have tatoos, gathered their experiences, located what appears to be considered as the best tatoo shop around, looked into allergies and prices, asked if it was a problem to have one over the large burn scar I have on my upper left arm from the time when I burnt a girl's name into it when I was younger and a <em>lot</em> more stupid, and various other elements of importance. In short, I'm only missing one slight detail.
</p>

<p>
  The content :-) What am I going to carve into my left shoulder? I knew this question would come up and in fact I have already drawn a number of possible motives but there is none that I find totally good. I tried to browse for tatoo or general motive sites but I haven't found anything totally to my liking there either. If you know of sites that list nice pictures that could be tatooed (possibly after having been modified, I can use Illustrator/Photoshop for that) I'd love to hear!

<h2>Content Suggestion</h2>

I had always toyed with the notion of getting a quote (perhaps in Latin) as a tattoo.  I want to get one, but I want to make sure it's something I can agree with in ten years.  (Unlike "Live Fast, Die Young" or "Born To Raise Hell", both of which fail the reality test after a certain age.)
<p>
A quote, or a camel.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>

  I thought of that but I want to avoid something readable, if only for the way that people look at you as they try to decipher what's written... I would however like to have a picture that <em>means</em> something that I will indeed still agree with in ten years time (and preferably more, as ten years won't take me all that far<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-).
</p>

<p>
  That, in fact, is very much part of the problem: I have lots of stuff I could express in a tatoo, the problem being how to express all of that in it while still having something that retains a certain aesthetic...

<h2>The Tattoo Rules</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ct/">ct</a> on 2002-01-22T10:02:48</h3>
A friend of mine has several and once shared with me his tattoo rules.<p>
1) No cartoon characters.<br>
2) No Band names or logos<br>
3) No women's names.</p><p>

He feels that all three of those are things you couldnt possibly want for the long term. Of course, he's broken two of those rules, with a Mickey Mouse head on his ankle and a stylized "The Beatles" on his shoulder.</p><p>
That's probably why tribal tattoo's are so popular.</p><p>
