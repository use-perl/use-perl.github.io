  Following a comment from ziggy on my previous entry, I
  feel I need to clarify.
</p>

<p>
  The CSS::SAC filter that outputs an XHTMLified CSS file 
  is just a pretty-printer. It was contributed by
  Steffen Goeldner and I want to run over it to see if it
  can be more featureful, ask his permission, and include 
  it in the dist (and prolly fully SAX2ify it in the 
  process).
</p>

<p>
  What I find cool about it is not what it actually 
  achieves (though I do like it much). It's more the SAC ->
  SAX approach. Call me a sad sad geek, but piping two 
  very cool APIs together is something I consider cool :-)
</p>

<p>
  Now, as for something that would either 1) take a single
  CSS stylesheet and produce the matching XSLT + FO sheet,
  it is possible (though you'll lose a few CSS Selector
  features that are not and will never be supported by
  XPath) but not totally trivial (I'd love to see someone 
  do that though); or 2) take a CSS stylesheet and an XML
  file (which I think is what ziggy was pointing to) and
  produce the corresponding XSL FO document, yes that would
  be awesome as well. And it wouldn't be too complex 
  either, because we already have some prior art in writing
  selector code. What's holding this project up presently
  is -- apart from the continuing 24h restriction on 
  circadian cycles -- the wait for PerlDOM to be completed.
</p>

<p>
  In other words, I'd like to implement that as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  (XML document) -> SAX -> DOM
  </li>
  <li>
  (CSS document) -> SAC -> decorate previously mentionned
  DOM with the CSS data, using the Stylesheets DOM 
  extension. Having a better CSS DOM would help as well, 
  but that part is already being worked on.
  </li>
  <li>
  DOM -> SAX with a style feature attached (to carry the 
  style information) -> SAX2FO filter (based on that 
  feature) -> SAX Handler (probably an XML Writer).
  </li>
  <li>
  Use the generated FO to do whatever you want. A good use
  would of course be to use AxKit's excellent PassiveTex
  module to generate some PDF on the fly. No matter how 
  many features people steal away from AxKit (hey, this is 
  Perl after all ;), it always seems to be a few steps 
  ahead...
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  That, imho, is the cleanest way of doing it. Surprisingly
  enough, it probably also is the simplest, if only because
  we already have most of the bricks.
</p>

<p>
  Now, if you're not an XML frood and you've been reading
  this far (which says something about your courage and/or
  sanity I guess), or even if you are an XML frood, you're
  probably wondering what the point of all this is... Well,
  XSL FO isn't really the most human friendly syntax out
  there. In fact, it's painful enough that it is the reason
  why XSLT was invented. However, it is probably the best 
  way to produce PDF, and other such formats (such as
  postscript) from XML (which makes it the easiest way to
  produce those formats programmatically). CSS, on the 
  other hand, is really trivial to write. So XML + CSS = 
  PDF would imho be a real winner.
