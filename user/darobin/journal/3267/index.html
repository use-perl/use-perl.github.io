  <code>xml:lang</code> is one of those small nuggets in the XML bundle which pretty much no one uses because they are so small and haven't been advertised much, but are truly useful.
</p>

<p>
  It's a simple, standard, attribute that simply says that the content within the scope of the element on which it resides is in that language (expressed as an ISO code).
</p>

<p>
  Naturally, XPath is equiped with the lang('lang') function that returns true if the current node is in the requested language (and it is smart enough to know that fr_CA is fr).
</p>

<p>
  Thanks to this, publishing multilingual documents in XML+XSLT is a no-brainer. I'd used it before but in a different way (mostly to filter out content before it was processed) and while I knew it to be useful I hadn't realised just how simple it is to just tag part of a structure as being in another language and not render it. While translating my r&eacute;sum&eacute; it occured to me that I had just used <code>xml:lang</code> without even thinking about it, and that it had just worked :)

<br>Doesn't it have to be "fr-CA" instead? "_" is for locales, "-" is
for language tags.</p>

  You are <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath#function-lang" title="w3.org">entirely right</a w3.org><nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p>

<p>
  For the ISO code part, I was using loose terminology (ie I'd heard that it wasn't restricted to ISO but hadn't looked much further), the XPath spec defined matching patterns in the simplest way (that is, a code will match anything on - or end boundaries).
</p>

<p>
  For the locale part, I got mixed up wanting to quote from the perllocale manpage (especially the part about dividing the world into nations instead of, say, "<em>bankers, bikers, gamers, and so on</em>") but forgot to<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

  Thanks for being vigilant!
