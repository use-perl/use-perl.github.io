  In my ongoing switch away from project manager, programmer, and other such geekish things into other types of jobs such as translation and writing, I have now managed to go a step further.
</p>

<p>
  Saturday night I worked as a barman in my favourite dive.
</p>

<p>
  And quite honestly, it was a bunch of fun. It also is physically exhausting which is definitely a pleasure because it means that you don't have to worry about sports or other such boring activities (not that I usually do, but just in case...). There's a satisfaction to crashing on your bed late saturday night because you can't feel your legs and back anymore from having worked too much, rather than because you're wasted. And then, I'm the one that thinks that to put "work" and "ethic" in the same sentence is one of the best recipes for oxymorons that I know.
</p>

<p>
  Having someone give me money as I left the bar was also something of a shock.
</p>

<p>
  Whatever comes of it, it certainly is fun. And &euro;40 for five hours is a decent pay. Who knows, maybe that next time you see me at OSCon I'll be there as a barman ;-)
</p>

<p>The most fun I ever had was working in a bar since they fed us, we got the occasional drink, got paid well on tips and it was a hell of a lot more social than the lab....it even paid better than my day job<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)....it's good exercise too. Good for you getting out from behind the evil sucking vortex that is the internet.</p>

<p>
  Yes, it really is fun (although very tiring) especially as that is the bar that I normally hang out in, and where I know pretty much everyone (this part of Paris is little more than a big village).
</p>

<p>
  I don't if I'd like to do that every day, but once or twice a week out to be cool<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Robin, you are now officially the embodiment of RMS ideal: the OS developer working a a waiter!<br>Congrats<br>And seriously I am glad at least you'll be able to pay your next rent

  Hmmm, I had no idea that there was such an ideal, I should probably update myself on RMS (I usually stay away from ideological debates in OSS on whether angels dancing on a license are free or not).
</p>

<p>
  <em>seriously I am glad at least you'll be able to pay your next rent</em>
</p>

<p>
  Thanks<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) It won't pay the rent by itself, but it'll sure help!
