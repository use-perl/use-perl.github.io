  It is often heard that Perl isn't yet very Unicode friendly, but that it'll be fixed in 5.8 (definitely a good thing). People point fingers at Perl for that but little do they realize how hard the problem is, and how much of the world is broken.
</p>

<p>
  For instance, while trying to fill an XSS vulnerability in Apache::Util::escape_html, Geoff Young and I found out that that sub wasn't UTF-8 aware. If you have double-byte chars one byte of which happens to match, say, &lt; it'll happily turn that part of the char into <tt>&amp;lt;</tt> which will of course not be exactly what you want :-)
</p>

<p>
  And of course, UTF-8 is just the tip of the problem. Anyone using UTF-16 will most likely see the strings they feed to C libs happily truncated at the first sign of a 0x00 hanging around in there, which is likely to be the first char of the string if the content happens to be simple english characters.
</p>

<p>
  In fact, that's what happens when you feed UTF-16 to Apache::Util, as well as probably to any C lib not equipped to deal with mutlibyte chars. Other problems include conversions between \n and \r\f and co. which'll just break UTF-16 (this is a problem in XML::SAX::Writer which I hope to partially fix).
</p>

<p>
  So Perl is far from being the only unfriendly part here, in fact it's probably one of the most friendly components. I have no end of admiration for the people that are working on fixing such complex issues and even making them DWIM.
</p>

<p>
  Note to self: don't use Apache::Util unless there is certainty that the strings are encoding safe.
