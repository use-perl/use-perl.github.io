  One of the people that responded to my posts on various mailing lists enquiring about work options was Xavier Cazin, editor at O'Reilly France.
</p>

<p>
  So we convened to meet and chat and see if there could be something for me to be done. He is a very nice and intelligent guy, and we ended up sharing ideas and the such for five hours. In fact, it would probably have been longer if I hadn't had another appointment in the afternoon.
</p>

<p>
  It would seem that I'll be translating the upcoming <em>Perl and XML</em> O'Reilly title into french, which would be cool as it'll bring in some money (and be an interesting job). We also talked about translating <em>Comprendre XSLT</em> (ie, Understanding XSLT) an O'Reilly book that was written in french and has no english equivalent as yet, and I'd sure love to translate that one. Other potential work included developing some CMS-related stuff for ORA France, but he needs to find the budget. Of course, we also chatted about lots of other things. I look forward to working with him if it does see the light of day.
