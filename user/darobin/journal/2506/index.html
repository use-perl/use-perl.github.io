  Ilya Sterin posted earlier to the perl-xml list asking for a list of modules that were SAX enabled. I went to CPAN to do some counting and was surprised myself with the results: over 30 modules already!
</p>

<p>
  I don't know why but I had been under the impression that it hadn't taken off very well. A fair number of people think it's a complex technology, despite the fact that it's just a different approach and is in fact powerful/simple enough that people have been doing one-liners with it. In addition to that you have all the Perlians going <em>"There are a lot of marketing people saying stupid stuff about XML so it must suck"</em> when they would normally know better, or those saying <em>"but $myFormattingLanguage is better"</em> without noticing that XML isn't a formatting/typesetting/whatever language (though it can be used for that), and so on. And then you have those that still use outdated or unsupported interfaces from the very early days when we were still trying to find out how to process XML and many mistakes were made.
</p>

<p>
  All in all, that didn't give me much hope. But seeing how well it's taking off in terms of module creation (as well as the number of questions on it that I received today) cheers me up. PerlSAX is where the power is. It's the ultimate glue API between the ultimate glue language and the ultimate glue data format. How could anything rock more than that?
</p>

<p>
  Oh, and that list just got increased by one as I released XML::Filter::BufferText, a little trick to make SAX even simpler :-)
