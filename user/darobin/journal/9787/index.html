  Sitting right next to me in the office is a (as yet, not too big) banana tree. It isn't exactly beautiful, poor wretched thing under the parisian climate, but it's green and of course that's the best colour anything can be.
</p>

<p>
  However it appears to be exhibiting behaviour unknown as yet to me. If you aren't familiar with the way banana trees grow, it's fairly simple: new leaves start appearing at the top in furled cylinders, and slowly unfurl into an inverted cone and then into a large full-fledged leaf.
</p>

<p>
  There is nothing peculiar with this banana tree's growth pattern. It's just that every time a leaf unrolls, it turns out to contain a pen. Not a special pen, your regular ball-pointed office furniture complete with the Clickety-Omatic fine tuned to perfectly annoy your cow-orkers during meetings. Most of them blue, of the "Paper Mate - Comfort Mate - M" brand (no, that's not a condom reference).
</p>

<p>
  I'd think it were just one of my amusing coworkers from the research department doing it weren't it for one detail: the pens are always drained dry even though no one uses those because they're ugly.
</p>

<p>
  I hope that by the time that tree grows larger, I'll have a chane to move to another office...
