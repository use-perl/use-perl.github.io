  It looks like I may soon be shopping for a job. I certainly hope not, but things are looking dimmer. We basically needed to sign two of the contracts we were working towards this year in order to survive, and to pay debt back.
</p>

<p>
  But I just got a call from one of those two clients telling me that they didn't have any budget this year, so that's pretty much one down. To make things a bit harder, it was our oldest client so it's not pleasant to know that we won't be working with them (they're happy with what we did, they just have no money).
</p>

<p>
  The other one is the largest of both. So if we signed them we're pretty much safe for another 6 months, probably enough to find other contracts. But it's also such a large contract that we have never fried any fish that big before. It can very well happen, but it seems unrealistic. I certainly won't believe that it's possible until I have the money. </p>

<p>
  If you're interested in a good Perl programmer with a strong knowledge in several XML fields, you might want to drop me an email just in case, to speed things up if events take a worse turn. I can't remember when last time was that I filled in a r&eacute;sum&eacute;, good pointers in that area are also welcome.
</p>

<p>
  In the meantime, I'm crossing my fingers. It'd surely suck to lose a company that I've built for five years. Especially as the company is now well equiped and burns little cash for itself -- only for us.
