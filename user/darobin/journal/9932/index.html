  Travel agencies usually suck. Opodo is worse. They started by losing my ticket (well, they say it should have been sent but they're not sure. What's certain is that it never made the long Paris-Paris journey it should have set out to). I called half a dozen times to get them to re-issue it, and they always promised to call back within two hours, which they never did until today. They don't answer their email (or they take more than ten days to do so).
</p>

<p>
  Finally, they had the ticket be re-issued today, five hours before take off... yet I'll still have to pay 50 euros upon retrieving my ticket at the counter which they promise to refund "within the shortest delay". Right.
</p>

<p>
  They'd already lost me as a customer when their site didn't work with Mozilla six months ago, now they managed to lose Expway as well. Stupid business from the airlines that spawned that company, they should stick to moving planes around and leave the web to people that know how it works. <em>Grumble.</em>

  Yes I did notice, while waiting at the Air France counter for the ticket which Opodo had forgotten to order... Which prompted me to think that they would have been better off launching a literary site<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
