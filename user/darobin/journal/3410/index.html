  Last night, knowing that things are a bit rough these days with the no job/no money situation, two friends of mine decided to drag me out for some drinks instead of letting me go through my nth re-read of Hardy's <em>Jude the Obscure</em>, which is possibly my favourite novel ever but isn't an entirely very saturday-nightish activity.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, the few drinks went slightly over the border... one cool thing with Paris is that all normal bars (ie not those that have permanent night authorisations) are allowed to not close at night (instead of the normal 0200) twice a month. Given the fact that we live in the area of Paris that has the highest density of bars, this means that there is <em>always</em> something open in the two streets (St Maur / Oberkampf) where our lairs lay.
</p>

<p>
  So we went through a few bars (Nun's, Barracao, Quartier G&eacute;n&eacute;ral, Cith&eacute;a if you must know) until 0600, and then decided to walk on to another district for the afters (to the Triangle, a smoky dive populated with heroin junkies and free breakfast -- my kinda place) where we stayed until 10. Finally, we decided it was time to prepare for the day and walked back to our area only stopping for a lot of coffees (Plein Soleil, Les C&icirc;mes) and meeting quite a few other friends there until 14, when I decided I ought to go to bed and my two accomplices moved on to the Parc des Princes to see a rugby match.
</p>

<p>
  My life has been way too serious as of the past few months. Going wild a little last night has been very enjoyable.
