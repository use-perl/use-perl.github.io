  Thursday I went to see Paris-Plage, which is closing down tonight. It was awesome. The Seine's riverside has been reclaimed to be used by pedestrians instead of useless ugly smelly cars and repurposed as a beach, with sand, palm tree, beach bars and sport, and lots of your average gorgeous parisian busy tanning.
</p>

<p>
  It's such a pity that we're giving back this part of our city that's classified as "Patrimoine de l'Humanit&eacute;" to cars tomorrow...

<h2>Life's a beach...</h2>

<p>I was there about a week ago (I had a couple of days in Epernay, then caught an early train into Paris followed by a sleeper into Italy), and the beach was great.  Loads of people walking up and down in the sun, walls for kids to climb over (I wanted a go), jazz bands and assorted strange French dramatics (I didn't understand a word -- but from the bemused looks on the faces of the obviously local spectators I doubt that made much of a difference in the comprehension stakes).  It's a shame the cars will come back.</p>

It was an excellent idea by the mayor and it's the sort of thing I hope will get him re-elected. If I'm not mistaken the banks of the Seine will continue to be free of traffic on weekends.
