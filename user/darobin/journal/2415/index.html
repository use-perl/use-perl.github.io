<p><p>
  I've been using Perl daily for five years and I think I know it fairly well (apart of course from some obscure filehandle magic or hidden things like PROPAGATE). Still, once in a while I get bitten but something that I didn't quite ignore, but that I clearly wasn't sufficiently aware of.
</p>

<p>
  Today I got bitten rather bad. I have this simple code in XML::NamespaceSupport that iterated over a hash, and if the value matched a given pattern would immediately return the key (for those interested, this was in <tt>getPrefix()</tt> or <tt>get_prefix()</tt> depending on your coding preferences). Grant McLean reported a strange bug: when calling that method twice in a row, the second call would most of the time return nothing. A rather weird thing to do for a piece of code that just looks inside a hash... Here a (simplified) version of the offending code (does anyone have code2usePerlPRE script ?):
</p>

<p>
<tt>
&nbsp;while (my ($k, $v) = each %{$self->{someHash}}) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return $k if foo($v);<br>
&nbsp;}
</tt>
</p>

<p>
  It seems pretty innocent at first, but those of you with acute eyes will have spotted the problem: <tt>each()</tt> uses an iterator to know where it is between two calls. That iterator, is only reset when it reaches the end of the hash. But here, unless there was a failure to match the condition, the end of the hash wasn't reached. So on the first call for a given pattern it'd match, but on the second call it'd start at the pair in the hash <em>following</em> the one that had previously matched. If that one failed, the next call would succeed again.
</p>

<p>
  I don't think that this is a problem with <tt>each()</tt> as there are good reasons for it to be so. However, one has to admit that it makes it rather easy to create a subtle bug. Perhaps a docpatch is in order?
</p>

<p>I never use each.  Originally the reason was that it was just so different from the way I thought that I couldn't even understand it.  Fortunately TMTOWTDI.  Now, though, I've seen many, many people get bitten by each, especially newcomers.  So I don't do it.</p>

<p>My body of code is full of:</p>

<tt>foreach my $key (%hash)
{
  print "$key:\t$hash{$key}\n";
}</tt>

<p>and similar constructs.</p>

<p>
  Yes, I'm switching a fair amount to for(each) now just to be on the safe side, only leaving each() when I know that I want it.
</p>

<p>
  I didn't use each() all that much. Mostly it was for cases when I was certain that I was going to want both the key and the value no matter what. I find it far more elegant and readable than the hash access syntax<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>I can read it now, but it just really made no sense to me at all when I first saw it.  I was having trouble enough understanding the whole hash concept, I think.  When people throw C&lt;each&gt; at a beginner, I don't see how they can handle it.</p>

<p>Some Perl trainer commented on a p6 list once that after discovering many students were confused initially by using $ for single array and hash elements (why is it $hash{key} instead of %hash{key} and $array[$key] instead of @array[$key]), he was finding it easier to teach them about accessing each element first before teaching them how to use @ and % to get the whole array or hash or a slice.  Then @ or % can be taught as meaning "the whole thing."</p>

<p>Of course, since Perl 6 is going to change all that I suppose it won't matter.  I wonder what will happen to C&lt;each&gt;.</p>

My perldoc -f says:

<blockquote><div>
There is a single iterator for each hash, shared by all each, keys, and values function calls in the program; it can be reset by reading all the elements from the hash, or by evaluating keys HASH or values HASH.
</div></blockquote>

So before I start a loop over each, I always have a line:

<blockquote><div>keys %thing;  # reset hash iterator
</div></blockquote>

<p>Or:

</p><blockquote><div>keys %{$self-&gt;{tiny_pies}};  # reset hash iterator
</div></blockquote>

Is keys in void context optimized to do nothing aside from resetting the iterator?  Although, I guess most hashes won't be a problem for efficiency, unless they are tied hashes, in which case you might not want such an optimization<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...

If I'm looking in the right place (<tt>doop.c</tt>, function <tt>Perl_do_kv</tt>), it does (a call to <tt>hv_iterinit</tt> comes before the context check).  I'm at patchlevel 14388.
