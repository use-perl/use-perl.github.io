  Very high up on my list of people to shoot when the revolution comes are registrars. Network Solutions (now Registrars.com) is still holding on to my berjon.com domain, even though it was transferred to amen.fr (a french registrar) several months ago, and is still valid there. When they considered the domain to have expired, it stopped working because their update is more recent and wins over amen.fr's update.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, this also caused amen.fr's system no end of problems, and it appears to have more or less given up on the idea.
</p>

<p>
  And to add insult upon injury, registrars.com is still flagging the domain as registered which makes it impossible for me to buy it again, and also impossible to renew it because I don't have an account with them. This is downright hijacking in that it leaves me with the sole choice of signing up with their Snapback service, which costs $49.
</p>

<p>
  So I've been busy emailing both sides of the problem, and was scheming to try to make an inter-registrar war happen (it might slaughter a few in the process, and can't be worse for the users) when some moronic DNS servers decided that knowscape.com existed no more. Today was the expiry day for that domain, but we renewed it some time ago. Surprisingly, everything is fine on the registrar side (<a href='http://gandi.net/'>Gandi.net</a>, one of the few that will not be against the wall because they're really good, really intelligent, social, and into french politics). Apparently the problem is with some trigger happy dns daemons... I'll have to wait until they realise that it hasn't expired to continue with my scheme.
</p>

<p>
  Remind me why it is we don't just use IPs ?

<p>I've got Gandi and I like 'em.  Plus it was neat getting to pay in Euros.</p>

Hmm, I didn't like them. Their UI was just too much like hard work.
<br>
<br>OpenSRS rocks though. I've not had a day of trouble with any of my OpenSRS domains.
