  As usual as the end of the CFP for OSCon, I find myself increasingly panicking to pick a topic. I keep going over the stuff I know enough about to talk about and everything appears to fall into two categories: either there's already someone on it and I don't want to duplicate, or there's no one on it and that gives me the impression that the topic is of interest to no one :-/

  <em>mull, mull, mull...</em>

<h2>OSCON topics</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gnat/">gnat</a> on 2003-02-10T19:53:35</h3>
I always ask people "what are you hacking on?"  Tim makes a big deal out of <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2002/05/14/oreilly_wwdc_keynote.html" title="macdevcenter.com">tracking the alpha geeks</a macdevcenter.com>, but the truth is that the interesting stuff that people like you and <a href="http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/CPAN/data/Time-Piece/Piece.html" title="uwinnipeg.ca">Matt Sergeant</a uwinnipeg.ca> and <a href="http://www.astray.com/cpanstats/" title="astray.com">Leon Brocard</a astray.com> are hacking on will be in everyone's face next year.  So if you have a project you've been beating on in your spare time<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... kick it loose!<p>

Another approach is a case study: is your company willing to talk about how they used Perl or any other open source system to make millions?  Alternatively, if your company creates open source and has a justification for it in the business model, can you talk publicly about it so that other companies can see the light?</p><p>

Pick a module you can't live without and convince others how great it is.</p><p>

Figure out what you'd have to teach your replacement.  If there's a skill (writing test cases, XS hacking, your preferred XML translation system, a particularly cute way of reading email from Perl) that you think applies outside your company, then submit a talk proposal on it.  Think: core skills.</p><p>

Some topics off the top of my head, not necessarily relevant to you, but which might kick-start others thinking:</p><p><ul>
<li>WxWindows tutorial</li>
<li>Inline tutorial</li>
<li>vcard or ical talk</li>
<li>POE tutorial</li>
<li>practical AI</li>
<li>top ten things found in code audits</li>
<li>top ten things you can do to make your code easier to read</li>
<li>analysis of why a particular module or system Got It Right (what makes it well-designed or implemented)</li>
<li>template toolkit tricks</li>
<li>five critical OO design patterns you've used in the last six months</li>
<li>signal handling</li>
<li>threading</li>
<li>five things everybody does wrong with XML</li>
<li>practical talk about the content management system you use (what it does, how you have it set up, how you use it to do the things you want)</li>
<li>live coding (build a program or a module in front of the audience).  NB, risky!</li>
<li>Why You Should<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.... (tell people what they should be doing)</li>
<li>I Saved My Sanity With<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... (module/system/methodology/insight here)</li>
<li>Guru Session (get together with one or two other experts in your field and take questions for 45 minutes)</li>
</ul>

Hope this helps!<p>
