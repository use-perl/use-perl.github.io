  My new job isn't really a Perl shop. In fact, it's not a Perl shop at all. I can't say it's Perl-hostile -- in fact several people on the research team have expressed the fact that they like Perl -- but as long as Perl doesn't run in cell phones and other even more limited devices, I don't think there'll be much of a market for Perl implementations of the stuff we do ;-)
</p>

<p>
  There were however two people (out of fifteen) that made fun of my loving Perl in the first two weeks (to be fair I must say that it was in a friendly way, a bit as I'd make gentle fun of one of those Python fu^W^Wguys).
</p>

<p>
  However today I gently put some of those clock on time as we say in French. One guy there wanted to cut an XML data file into several small logical subcomponents. Various things flew around, XSLT with Java extensions, a Java SAX filter, hellish and wrong regexen, or a few other things that I don't quite remember.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, Perl, that language that "isn't quite there in terms of XML", got the job done in ten very clean and readable strict-and-warnings enabled lines. <em>&lt;grin></em>
