"Anyone but Bush" has been fading recently. Nowadays the Bush campaign are the ones more likely to be using the "we aren't ____" argument. The Bush website lately has far more pictures of Kerry on the front page than of Bush, while Bush photos are rare on the Kerry front page.

Yes, and it is a good strategy.  They've been at it for months.  Basically, there are three kinds of voter: those who are for candidate A, those who are for candidate B, and those who are undecided.  The first two don't matter.  As to the latter group, they already know Bush, and there's frankly little Bush can say good about himself to convince them he is the best candidate.  He needs to convince them that Kerry is worse, and he's doing a pretty good job of it.<br>

That was pretty much my point.  I entirely agree that it's poisonous -- it's a shameful way to run a political process and it makes me weep for the future. But saying that "I won't vote for A because I don't like these people associated with A." when there are people like this on all sides of a process that's nececessary to participate in (differentiating it from those crazy open source people) is just sticking your head in the sand.

  There's a major difference though between techno-zealots and "anything but Bush". Whether you use Python or Perl, BSD or Linux, Pg or MySQL, honestly, at the end of the day, won't make much of a diff to people's lives. Worst case scenario is that a good piece of tech doesn't get enough momentum and dies out. Ok that's sad, and it may be frustrating, but life goes on.
</p>

<p>
  "Anything but Bush" is just like "anything but Kim Chong-il" or "anything but the Talibans". At some point it just stops mattering what the alternative is, it just has to change. And preferably fast.
</p>

<p>
  The difference is between what is up for discussion and what isn't. Whether to use Java or Ruby is something that should be discussed, not zealoted about. One does not however discuss whether wreaking havoc worldwide like a hord of beheaded mutant chickens is the way to go or not. One just says, "it has to stop".

I won't touch the "moron" label (sure, those Bushisms are embarassing sometimes, but it's hard for me to swallow a Yale and Harvard MBA graduate as a "moron"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)), but I would label Kerry with the same murderous tag.  Shooting a fleeing Vietnamese in the back as well as the unknown (<a href="http://www.streamload.com/jmstein77/Kerry2.mp3" title="streamload.com">or known</a streamload.com> {from Kerry's own lips}) atrocities that Kerry participated in, over in Vietnam deserve the same judgement.<br> <br>Of course, it depends on who you listen to, the <a href="http://www.swiftvets.com/" title="swiftvets.com">Swift Vets gang</a swiftvets.com> or the Democrats (and the mainstream media that loves 'em), but I'm not sure why Kerry won't release his records and let us see the truth (like Bush had to do back in 2000 after the media relentlessly hammered for them).  Or maybe I do know why... maybe it has something to do with the fact that <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewSpecialReports.asp?Page=%5CSpecialReports%5Carchive%5C200405%5CSPE20040503a.html" title="cnsnews.com">19 of 23 officers who served with Kerry and <b>every</b> commanding officer of Kerry's believe he's unfit to be Commander-in-Chief.</a cnsnews.com> <br> <br>Peace,<br> <br>Jason

  WRT the murderous there's a difference not only in degree but also in nature between some war atrocities and send people to butchery by starting an entire war based on lies purely for personal profit.

<p>
  As for Kerry's competence, it simply doesn't matter: no matter how incompetent you just can't be worse than Bush. It's never been seen in any major country before, and, with any hope, won't be seen again in our lifetimes. The Democrats could run a monkey for presidency, I'd still support the monkey -- because he'd still do a better job than Bush.

That's completely ignoring the fact that this whole thing wasn't started by Bush, but by the terrorists from 9/11.  Even John Kerry believes we did the right thing, by going to war with Afghanistan and Iraq (though he wanted a different approach).  Maybe if <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/article.aspx?docID=241" title="factcheck.org">he showed up</a factcheck.org> at the intelligence committee meetings, his approach would be considered and his ideas validated.

  Afghanistan was the right thing to do. Or rather, it would have been the right thing to do right. It has been left mostly to its own devices, and large tracts of the taliban movement and al-Qaeda are still operating there because of that. Iraq had no link whatsoever to terrorism. Now it's become the most convenient way to attack american interests, and therefore a terrorist hotbed.
</p>

<p>
  Small things can be indicative. For instance, there may be reasons why after 9/11 98% of Europeans said they were extremely supportive of the US. Two years later, 78% of the same ranked the US as the most important threat to peace and security worldwide, in front of such friendly entities as terrorists or North Korea. Terrorism is an international plague. If you think more terrorism of that magnitude hasn't taken place, don't you think you're forgetting 3/11? Madrid? Rings a bell? There were fewer losses thankfully, but that's only because the ten bombs set off a touch too early and failed to bring the roof of the station to fall, as the plan was. A bit as if the towers had been hit but hadn't crumbled. If you think Bush eradicated more terrorism than he created, go argue your points to a Madrilene.
</p>

<p>
  The war on Iraq wasn't started by the terrorists, it was started unilaterally by the current Republican administration, and I have trouble understanding how one can not see that today, with lesser media blitz and the largest pro-war newspapers accumulating mea-culpas for having been blind and biased. The terrorists suffered zilch from the war in Iraq, but some people got their hands on strategic oil. I don't see how 9/11 justifies Iraq -- just because someone punches you in the face doesn't mean you can go hit on some random other guy. Everyone knows that that administration had plans to invade Iraq and only needed an excuse -- the neo-cons had been saying it for two years before election already.

<em>If you think Bush eradicated more terrorism than he created, go argue your points to a Madrilene.</em> <br> <br>Sorry darobin, there is not a jot of evidence that Bush's actions contributed to 3/11.  You actually believe what they say?  Talk about "moron."  Bin Laden said he attacked on 9/11 because of U.S. support of Israel, which is something he never mentioned years before when he was attacking the U.S.  They change their reasons to whatever they think will garner them the most support.  Don't buy into the foolishness.<br> <br> <em>The terrorists suffered zilch from the war in Iraq</em> <br> <br>Nonsense.  We have killed a great many of them, and continue to.<br> <br> <em>but some people got their hands on strategic oil.</em> <br> <br>Who?<br> <br> <em>I don't see how 9/11 justifies Iraq -- just because someone punches you in the face doesn't mean you can go hit on some random other guy.</em> <br> <br>9/11 showed us that we have an enemy out there, and that if we wait for them to come to us, we have already lost.  The decision was made to help transform the Middle East, to remove some of the trouble spots.  Iraq was the biggest and easiest and most obvious target, because of its ties to terrorism, because of its existing sanctioned regime, because we wanted him gone anyway.<br> <br>In the end, it is about regional stability.  Seen Syria on a map lately?  Anti-war people like to say how we should attack Syria instead, because they are the most active in supporting terrorism.  But one of the primary ways they exported their terrorists was through Iraq.  Now how will they get out?  Through Turkey, Israel, Jordan?  We are working to transform Syria and Iran by putting pressure on them through the transformation of Iraq.<br> <br>It should be telling that the governments of Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, etc. were all in favor of the war in Iraq.  They knew something needed to be done to remove the threat to regional stability.<br> <br>Will it work?  Dunno.  But if you wish to debate it, fine.  But if all you wish to do is pretend this was some simple-minded effort to kill people for oil, then you clearly don't wish to have a reasonable debate.<br>

<em>WRT the murderous there's a difference not only in degree but also in nature between some war atrocities and send people to butchery by starting an entire war based on lies purely for personal profit.</em> <br> <br>The problem is that the latter never happened.  First, even if you believe the WMD was a lie, that doesn't mean the entire war was based on lies.  We know many justifications for the war were absolutely true, including Iraq's noncompliance with UN resolutions which threatened force, including that Iraq aided terrorists (not al Qaeda, but many others), including that Iraq was a despotic regime destroying its own people and continuing to pose a threat to its neighbors in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... the list does go on.<br> <br>Further, there is not a jot of credible evidence that Bush profitted (or will profit) from the war at all, let alone that it was a motivation.<br> <br>Please don't be so blinded to the facts by your hatred.

The administration made reference to "material breach" of Resolution 1441 early and often.<br> <br> <em>I love a good conspiracy theory as much as the next bloke but you have to admit those nice no-bid Haliburton contracts make you think don't they?</em> <br> <br>Eh, not really, when you consider all of the factors: the shift in recent years to hiring one contractor to do all the work, the fact that very few companies can handle that kind of a contract, the fact that most people believe Haliburton is the best out there to do the job, the fact that Haliburton was already handling much of the work we'd need done, and the fact that the timing was such that having an open bidding process would have taken too long and would have damaged our attempts to work with the UN Security Council to get a second resolution (which ultimately failed anyway).<br> <br>Superficially, it looks bad, but I don't think it actually is that bad.  Some people say, isn't it funny that the company doing this used to have the VP as its CEO?  But really, Haliburton is the best, so they are going to have the best as their CEO: someone with a great deal of experience at Middle Eastern relations, someone with government contacts (foreign and domestic), etc.  Cheney never thought he would hold public office again.
