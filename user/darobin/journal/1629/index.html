  Yesterday evening we were celebrating the birthday of a friend who just turned 22. She's finnish and was nostalgic of finnish food so we went to a finnish restaurant.
</p>

<p>
  I was a bit scared as I'd seen that restaurant before and it sports an impressive vodka collection. Seeing the amount of alcohol I've injested since last saturday, I was fearing I might be in for another crazy night.
</p>
<p>
  Thankfully, all the others had also been drinking as much as I all week, so we decided to concentrate on the food. It was perfectly delicious. Lots of salmon and other varied fish or fish based dishes, with cream and potatoes. And all sorts of those lovely weird sounding names that I wish I could remember. If you have a chance, I recommend trying finnish food.
</p>
<p>
  Oh, and with all that good food, it was hard not to get a little something to wash it down, and a little something to help digest, and then lots of little somethings for the sake of it. Yes, we all went home very thoroughly drunk.
