  The Perl XML list has recently been graced with the subscription of what appears to be a very evolved Articial Intelligence, or at least a very good speech generator. It has a rather cryptic name (JimcDTWwws) and its creator is as yet unbeknownst to us. But we're looking for him. Desperatly.
</p>

<p>
  The quality of its artificial speech capacities can be judged in the <a href='http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Browse/ByAuthor/perl-xml?author=JimcDTWwws@aol.com'>archives</a>. I particularly recommend the poem at the bottom of <a href='http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl-xml/1041944'>this post</a>. A true masterpiece in computer-generated art.

I can't tell if you're serious, if it's an AI, or what.

I need more coffee...</p>

  Well we don't know. The dominant theory is that it's an AI or a speech generator... but some of us are afraid that it might be a real human person.

With a little more coffee, it feels a little reminiscent of Racter's jibba-jabba.  Perhaps it's a mod of that engine (names, companies, etc. escape me at the moment, it was something proprietary back when Racter came out.)

<h2>AI</h2>

Yep, I'm on that list also and I had to show a co-worker a couple of his/her/it's posts as I was quite impressed.  I got a big kick out of <a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl-xml/1040390" title="activestate.com">this</a activestate.com> post by someone who had yet to figure out it was a troll, laugh I nearly shat myself<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Some quick Googling has revealed it's turned up elsewhere, I think.
<p>
Perhaps I'm really too curious about this.  I have located a <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/user/rjc/" title="ic.ac.uk">home page</a ic.ac.uk> and another <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/xmledi-list@lists.bizserve.com/msg00371.html" title="mail-archive.com">example</a mail-archive.com> of its work.
</p><p>
The purpose -- annoyance, brevity, or experimentation -- is still unfathomable to me, but an easy guess is just to see how long it takes for people to realize it's not quite a person.</p>
