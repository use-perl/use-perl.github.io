  After years of waiting, at very long last someone has had the brilliant idea of opening a bagel shop right next to my office (which also makes it right next to home). This is absolute bliss.
</p>

<p>
  One can say all one wants on french cuisine -- which is indeed delicious for full meals -- it is impossible not to notice just how short it falls of making a good snack.
</p>

<p>
  No one in France, even in Paris despite its lush restodiversity, knows how to make a proper snack. If you don't want a full meal, you have a choice between endlessly boring variations on waffles, food-poisoned kebaps, McDo / Quick (the latter being palatable, but not every day), or sandwiches that would make those Douglas Adams describes in <em>So Long and Thanks for All the Fish</em> (yes, the ones that are there for british people to atone for their sins) seem like delicious treats in comparisons.
</p>

<p>
  So a bagel shop, even though it's not a very good one, is immense relief. The next step is for someone to start doing Fish 'n' Chips, but sadly, I'm not holding my breath.

<h2>Welcome to the civilized world...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2001-12-19T00:08:58</h3>
Forget thousand year old castles and art galleries that house collections more valuable than the gross national product of Ghana.  Here's how to judge when you're in a civilized place:
<ul>
<li>There's a supermarket less than 5 minutes away that's about the size of an aircraft hanger (bonus points if it's a natural food supermarket)</li>
<li>There's a coffee shop open until midnight nearby (bonus points if it's open before 8am, serves good coffee and <i>isn't</i> Starbucks)</li>
<li>There's a good bookstore nearby with amazingly obscure titles always in stock (Bonus points if it isn't either Borders or Barnes and Noble)</li>
<li>Great local produce, and great restaurants to match</li>
<li>Great bread</li>
<li>Great beer and wine (both amazing, wonderful, fresh local stuff, and a sizable selection of imports)</li>
<li>More Perl programmers per capita than Java and Python programmers (combined)</li>
</ul>
But, most importantly:
<ul>
<li>A bagelry that makes amazing fresh bagels daily, and has a kickass selection of smoked fish (double bonus points if they make good bread and serve top notch deli meats)</li>
</ul>
Oh, and <i>truly</i> civilized places have some other things that aren't even food related.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
