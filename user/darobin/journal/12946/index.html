  Are there any decent ones? I mean <em>really</em> decent ones, like TextPad or Kate. None of that emacs, or vi, or bbedit sillyness. Thanks for any pointers!

I've found BBEdit to easily surpass Textpad in almost every way so far - what about it don't you like?

  I don't know where to start, it's all wrong! No tabs! No good at configurable indenting! Many many other things! And the HTML heritage bears heavily...

BBEdit has been around a lot longer than it has been used for HTML, and I don't think you could point at much of significance that you would use for coding that comes directly from its HTML features.<br> <br>BBEdit is not perfect, but it is the best editor out there, bar none.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>
  When I tried it half the menus were covered with HTML-related stuff. Perhaps that's changed, and perhaps they can be removed. It doesn't give a first good impression. On second impression, I found a shortage of shortcuts to navigate around text. Again, probably configurable but points to a more mouse-oriented approach which I dislike (a general reproach for most things Mac it would seem -- I tend to expect at the very least Ctrl-arrow, Ctrl-Shift-arrow, Ctrl-Backspace-arrow, Ctrl-Del-Arrow where "arrow" can also be end/begin/page-up/page-down).
</p>

<p>
  And no tabs!

<em>When I tried it half the menus were covered with HTML-related stuff.</em> <br> <br>You may have been using Bizarro BBEdit<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... only one of the menus is related to HTML, the one called "Markup".  And you can even turn it off, last I checked.  And it was never more than that.  There are a few other places in the menus where you may see HTML stuff (like under Window -&gt; Palettes), but that is about it for menus.<br> <br>A good 1/4 - 1/3 of the Preferences are related to HTML, but those can be ignored if you don't use it for HTML.<br> <br> <em>I found a shortage of shortcuts to navigate around text.</em> <br> <br>There are many.  What functions did you want to perform?<br> <br> <em>And no tabs!</em> <br> <br>I use tabs all the time.  You can configure your tab stop default, and per-file.

  The strict minimum I need for text navigation is:
</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>&nbsp; jump word<br>&nbsp; end/start-line<br>&nbsp; select word<br>&nbsp; select to end/start-line<br>&nbsp; select line<br>&nbsp; jump to matching bracket<br>&nbsp; select brackets inner<br>&nbsp; select brackets outer<br>&nbsp; jump paragraph<br>&nbsp; select paragraph<br>&nbsp; select inter-paragraph<br>&nbsp; end/start-file<br>&nbsp; select to end/start-file<br>&nbsp; select-page-up/down<br>&nbsp; delete-word<br>&nbsp; backspace-word<br>&nbsp; delete to start/end of line</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>
  I've probably forgot a few, but without that I'm a poor lost coder<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Some of those are handled using standard Mac OS key commands.  For example, opt-arrow jumps words, and opt-shift-arrow selects words as you jump (shift selects, remember that you can usually add shift to a function to select whatever you are doing).<br>Some of them may not be supported by Mac OS standards or by BBEdit's basic functionality, but BBEdit also has an emacs mode, where it supports all emacs key commands<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... of course, we know how you feel about emacs.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

  Yes, I didn't say there were none of them! Default win/lin OS settings don't have enough to my taste either (I tend to want to use those anywhere I can type text in). Thankfully Textpad and Kate solve that nicely.

<p>
  I saw that Qt/Mac was just release (yay!). I'll see if I can get Kate running after work<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

But that is a lot of functions you mentioned<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I don't know how you could memorize all of them in any case if you have a problem memorizing them for emacs.

<p>
  They're all consistent, using always the same modifiers combination (and only Ctrl and Shift), with "obvious" special keys arrows, end, home, pg-up, pg-down, and backspace, del.

Oh, you mean tabs so you can have multiple documents in one window.  Well, most programs don't have that.  I am not a big fan of tabs, but YMMV.<br> <br>Besides, with Expos&eacute; in Mac OS X 10.3, you won't need tabs.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>
  Yeah, those tabs<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I can't live without tabs. No tabs means not an option. I've looked at Expos&#195;&#169;, it does look like it'll help for a lot of the misery I feel switching between windows on OS X, but it ain't like tabs. I don't want to see lots of miniatures of the stuff I'm editing (especially as I often have several dozen files open simultaneously), I want to see little tabs with a title so that I can tab through them!

<h2>Just rumor?</h2>

I thought there was a Perl plugin for CodeWarrior, but I could be imagining things.  What about Eclipse with the Perl plugins?

<h2>Simple option</h2>

I use BBEdit somewhat, but Hydra is a great tool for simple text editing, and includes some (unexercised by me) syntax highlighting, etc.<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://hydra.globalse.org/<br> <br>Eclipse is nice, but a bit, well, piggy.<br> <br>

<h2>Kate for MacOS X</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Shlomi Fish/">Shlomi Fish</a> on 2003-06-19T16:59:34</h3>
I think that KDE runs on MacOS X and therefore Kate as well.

<h2>Re:Kate for MacOS X</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/darobin/">darobin</a> on 2003-06-19T17:07:29</h3>
<p>
  Yes, but that requires X+KDE+Qt+Kate, eventually I may do that but I need to get started and not to spend three days installing software<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;) Thanks!
</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Kate for MacOS X</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2003-06-20T16:29:40</h3>
Trolltech is releasing a Cocoa-native version of Qt under the GPL.
<p>
I don't know if that means you will be able to compile KDE+Qt+Kate
without any intervening X bits, but it's certainly a start.</p>

<h2>Why not Emacs?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2003-06-19T21:22:25</h3>
Before you ask for something that is not emacs, you must first explain what you find as its faults.

  Well I'm usually pretty fast at learning stuff. I tried to get to work with emacs three times (including last week). After two hours I can vaguely remember how to get around and do a few basic things. The next day it's gone no matter what.
</p>

<p>
  It simply won't get in. Whoever's idea that is of a usable interface doesn't come from my planet<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Hmm.  Sounds like people when they are beginning Perl. {grin}
<p>
Yes, Emacs takes a bit to get familar.  But once you're there... it's an amazing tool.</p>

<h2>Re:Why not Emacs?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/darobin/">darobin</a> on 2003-06-20T14:27:22</h3>
<p>
  Well I picked up Perl a *lot* faster<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;) I don't doubt that it may be an amazing tool, I just don't happen to have three spare weeks with nothing else to do<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-/ A text editor should be easy to pick up. I don't care if I have to struggle to fine tune it later, but the basics should be so that at least I can start using it before I know more.
</p>

<p>
  And that's how it differs from Perl: "baby emacs" is already way too hard.

  Yes, I can use vi(m), but I have other reasons for disliking it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;) I guess I'll just wait for Trolltech to release Qt/Mac (any minute now) and see if that's enough to get Kate working...

<h2>Project Builder</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/echo/">echo</a> on 2003-06-20T09:50:46</h3>
After digging around for a while I settled with Apple's Project Builder (from the devtools). It's not quite optimal for me (I haven't figured out all the keyboard shortcuts) but it handles various character sets correctly, and I like the left pane which holds my project files. YMMV...
