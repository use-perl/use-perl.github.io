  Has anyone had issues with the OS X Address Book? All of a sudden, mine has gotten into the habit of freezing for five minutes before I can start using it (after that it's fine). I only have four people in it... Deleting its Library files and relaunching it doesn't change anything. This causes Mail to do the same (it waits for five minutes when "Loading Address Book" before becoming usable).
</p>

<p>
  This is quite a bummer, I'd just decided that I'd start using more native apps (as opposed to mostly unixish stuff) to see if it worked. Hmmm, it's not working :(

I have a lot of Address Book entries (several hundred), and no such problems.

It has happened to me once, the exact same symptoms. I figured my Mac was a bit tired and rebooted, I haven't had the problem since. Despite MacOSX being Unixy in its core, I haven't enjoyed the same uptimes I do with real Unix systems, after a couple of weeks of usage I start seeing delays that are cured by a reboot.

  Thanks, that fixed it! I'm so used to playing with the terminal all the time that I'm totally in "Unix mode" and the thought of rebooting simply hadn't crossed my mind<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Ah well, I guess it's still a bit windowish on the side...
