  At OSCon this year I'll be talking about Perl Content Management Systems. I've been scribbling a lot about what I could or should say, and I'm starting to look for ways to make all this coherent. First and foremost, I'm looking for ways to make the talk more than a catalogue of a few options.
</p>

<p>
  In that, I'd appreciate input. The idea is not to pick the best CMS, but rather to show the variety of options, knowing that all can be extended into doing what you want them to do but that depending on what that is it might be better to chose one over the other. If you have anything you'd like to see me focus on, this is the time to shout as I'll soon be starting to write my talk down.
</p>

<p>
  The current list of CMSs that I'll be covering include Slash, Bricolage, CallistoCMS, and perhaps  XIMS (depending on input from the authors). I'll perhaps also cover Tessera, depending on whether the Properties/Collection code is stable by then (or at least vaguely usable to demonstrate the idea). If I haven't included your favourite baby, please don't hesitate to drop me an email explaining what it is and why you'd like to see it covered (it ought to be different enough from the above ones). I'll probably be emailing the authors soonish to ask if they agree with what I'll be saying.
</p>

You expect me to agree with ANYTHING you say??

<p>
I would add <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/" title="movabletype.org">mt</a movabletype.org> (Perl, but not Open Source[tm]) <br>
and perhaps <a href="http://www.noahgrey.com/greysoft/" title="noahgrey.com">Greymatter</a noahgrey.com>.

</p><p>
You might like to <a href="http://fury.com/article/1331.php" title="fury.com">
contrast version control
with publishing-content delivery</a fury.com>, <br>
and show where each package fits in.
</p><p>
If you really want to talk about <em>Content Management</em>,
include CVS in your talk.

<p>
  This being the "Open Source Conference", I won't go into details about non-oss solutions. Greymatter could be an option but I don't feel like going into all available blogging apps, even if I have to miss one that may be better. I'm already talking about Slash which should cover a good part of a blogger's needs (remember, this is for programmers, not users).
</p>

<p>
  That article is interesting but I would tend to disagree with it. To begin with, some CMSs have CVS as their backend. And CVS doesn't do anywhere near as much as some CMSs can. I agree with his distinction implying Content Delivery but that covers only a few bits, and I'm not sure that it applies to blogs as well as it applies, say, to personalisation engines. Also, CVS is not Perl and I'm supposed to talk about Perl things<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>
  Thanks a lot for your comments.
