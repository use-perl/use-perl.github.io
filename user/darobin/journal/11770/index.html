  A. Star Spangled Ice Cream is for real even though some people may think our flavor names are over the top. And not only real, but really, really delicious.

<h2>Weird</h2>

<p>First I really thought it was a joke. And I thought it was funny. But then as I read along it seems that it is for real...In the end I really can't tell. Could anyone in the US enlighten us and let us know?</p>

<p>If it is real I guess the over-the-top tone of the web site would be considered good marketing, I would expect a huge buzz around this brand. Plus I would think that the media will love it.</p>

<p>When did they pass the law that says that extreme-right nuts are OK and can behave like raving lunatics but liberals can't even hint that maybe the current administration is not entirely perfect without being called anti-Americans and offered a one-way ticket to Afghanistan/Irak/Syria/North Korea/France or whatever the next evil-doer-of-the-month will be?</p>

I think it is real, dunno.  But yeah, good marketing, I guess.  I think it is funny.  I'll still buy Ben &amp; Jerry's.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>As to who says what<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... it's cyclical.  Ten years ago it was the other way 'round.  And it depends on where you are, too<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... in #perl, us conservatives are the oddballs<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
