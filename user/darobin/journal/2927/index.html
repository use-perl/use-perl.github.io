<p><p>
  Making use of <em>use Perl</em>'s new cool SOAP features, I've created a small, simple, and thin wrapper around them, if only to remember the interface. It has its quirks and limitations, but it works.
</p>

<p>
  This is the first step in an attempt to create a WxPerl journal editor, when/if I get the time. You can grab it from <a href='http://berjon.com/src/SOAP.pm'>http://berjon.com/src/SOAP.pm</a>.

This will be broken sometime in the near future.  The interface is not set, which is why I haven't announced it.

  I thought as much, but as far as I'm concerned I don't mind much. Developping the UI will take time, something which I don't have plenty of these days. And the wrapper is simple enough that it can probably be rewritten in a few minutes now and then<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p>

<p>
  One thing that I found missing in the interface is nick2uid mapping and/or the ability to use a nick instead of a uid when fetching entries. Apart from that, it's really cool.

The good thing about SOAP is that you point at a dummy proxy/endpoint while testing.  And it's easy to do.  So that should let you debug the wxPerly bits with the current interface in a stable state, and then debug the new interface when Pudge makes it public.
<p>
Just $0.02.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

I don't know if I'll support that or not.  Probably not now, just because it might part of a larger SOAP interface for Slash, and I don't want to add it only to remove it later.  It would belong in some Users package, not in Journal.  And it's easy to look up user IDs manually.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
<br>
<br>Another thing might be an eventual Zoo interface (that which supplies the friends/foes stuff), to let you see who your friends/foes/etc. are, and maybe add and remove friends/foes.  And this is why I don't want to move ahead too fast, as there's a lot of functionality that can be added, and it should be added slowly and in its correct place.  Journals is just the first test case of all this so everyone (users and developers) can say what they like and don't like about what's there, and then we can move on and add the things that aren't.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<br>
<br>Hopefully in the next few weeks I will finalize what I think it should be, then I'll publish the API (I've already written most of it up) and let people go to town with it.
