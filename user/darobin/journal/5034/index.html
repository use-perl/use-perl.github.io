  After two months of various surprises and stories, the leak in my apartment that was destroying my neighbour's ceiling has now been located, YAY!
</p>

<p>
  It wouldn't be such a relief were it not for how long it took, and for the threats that I received along the way.
</p>

<p>
  The plumber that found it (for it was very well hidden) was rather amazing. The first thing he did was that he proceeded to <em>smell</em> my flat. He sniffed around it for five minutes as if he were a drug dog looking through luggage. At first I was slightly irritated as while I don't think that my home is the nicest place on earth, I wouldn't consider it to be a dirty smelly place.
</p>

<p>
  After a while he said: "Ah, I think I know where the leak is." I must say that I was rather dubious at that point. But he walked straight to the kitchen, opened a cupboard (in which I had already looked for the leak and found none), tapped against its interior wall, saw that it was hollow, broke it, and found the leak.
</p>

<p>
  It only took him five minutes to fix it. I am still very much impressed, and left wondering why that guy isn't working as a "nose" in the perfume industry. I have friends coming to my place several times a week, we often fix ourselves something to eat in the kitchen right above where the leak was and none of them ever smelt anything special. That guy must be a mutant or something...
</p>

<p>
  Anyway, now all I have left to do in order to return myself to a normal life (for my own definition of those terms) is to finish off a smallish site, dash to the end of the chapter I'm currently translating (which was interrupted by the recent political events), and find a more or less regular revenue stream. It might seem like a lot (especially the third part) but after the past times of electricity, bank, rent, insurance, and leak trouble (not to mention other things best kept silent) this feels like a genuine relief :-)
</p>

<p>
  Besides, it's sunny in this parisian springtime, and that can only be good.
