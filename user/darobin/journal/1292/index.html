<p><p>
  XML::SAX, as released recently by Matt Sergeant, is faced
  with a rather serious problem, causing no end of 
  discussion between the people involved in its creation.
</p>

<p>
  The problem is this: XML::SAX (as available on CPAN) 
  contains several modules:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  XML::SAX::Base - this is the base class (by Kip Hampton) 
  on which all SAX2 Drivers and Filters must be built. 
  Well, you could create one without it, but honestly you'd
  be rather stupid.
  </li>

  <li>
  XML::SAX::Exception - this is the root of the SAX 
  exception classes. It doesn't do much, but all 
  thingsSAX2 should normally throw exceptions that are
  subclasses of this one.
  </li>

  <li>
  XML::SAX::ParserFactory - this is the part that acts as
  "DBI for SAX", in other words it's JAXP/SAX in Perl. You
  ask for a SAX parser (optionally that supports some given
  features) and it gives you the one it thinks is most 
  appropriate (or blows up if it can't).
  </li>

  <li>
  XML::SAX::PurePerl - this is an XML parser written in
  pure Perl. It is the fallback parser in case no other
  faster parser can be found.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The problem stems from the fact that all these are 
  shipped together. So that, if the build for onw of them
  fails, then the build for all fails (from a newbie point
  of view at least, and it drives us all nuts to have to
  "force install" on those huge packages doesn't it ?).
</p>

<p>
  We could very well ship Base + Exceptions separately as 
  they form the backbone of everything SAX related. The 
  other two are useful only for XML parsing (ie if you 
  create a SAX driver that reads CSV and fires XML events,
  they'll be of no use whatsoever to you). Perhaps
  ParserFactory could be made to be useful outside of 
  pure XML, but it seems unlikely.
</p>

<p>
  But part of the community is tired with people using
  really bad approaches to XML (eg parsing directly with
  regexes, using raw XML::Parser, etc) and would like to
  make the SAX modules so easy to install that people just
  wouldn't be able to resist. SAX itself is easy, but it
  needs all the PR it can get. And those people don't like
  having to install two modules...
</p>

<p>
  So what's the solution that would allow us to make 
  things easy for unexperienced users and pleasant for
  experienced ones ? Bundles won't work with the former, 
  and even have issues with the latter. The SDK stuff ? 
  How is that moving ahead ? Any suggestions here are 
  definitely welcome.
