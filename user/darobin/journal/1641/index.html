  I got them, I got them !!!! All ?15.25 of them (40 coins). [if you can't see the euro sign before the 15.25, it's simply because use.perl can't cope with it it seems. *sigh*]
</p>

<p>
  I actually tried to buy them yestereve at midnight, but no one would sell them to me. So I got up at 8 this morning (something <em>highly</em> unusual believe me) and rushed to buy my euro kit. 
</p>

<p>
  The coins can't be used before Jan 01, but it's well worth seeing them. The designer of the french euros went a bit crazy on the back side of the 1 and 2 euro coins (the front of the coins are the same for all countries, but the back is country specific. Of course, you can use them everywhere, only the look changes). It's some sort of strange tree that looks a bit like a mysterious symbol from a remote civilisation, a touch psychedelic with all the shiny stars around it (but without the  psychedelic colour-blind colouring). I can't wait for it to become legal tender so that we get to see the designs from other countries.
</p>

<p>
  Anyway, I'd better stop being so excited about it here before some of our weird friends that live north west from here start looking at me strangely. Oh, too late, Matt Sergeant already called me names :-)  Oh well...</p>

You need to collect all the Euro coins for all the different countries now.

<p>It's almost a non-question. Already one in three London shops have admitted that they'll be accepting the Euro next year. The real number is probably far higher. And the rest of the country will surely follow very soon.</p>
<p>By the time Blair decides to hold a referendum the currency will be in common circulation and that's sure to tip the balance towards a "yes" vote.</p>

We basically will return what you provide.  If you want a euro, you need to provide the right entity for it.  So try <tt>&amp;euro;</tt> for &euro;.  It will only show up on some browsers/fonts, but that's the best we can do<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... it should work pretty well in most places though.  It even works on this Netscape 4.77 with the Times New Roman font.

  Hahaha, sorry, I was probably a little too fast in writing, and I didn't intend to blame use.perl alone<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).
</p>

<p>
  This is a general problem due to the brokennes of application/form-data. Types in the application/* space can't have charset parameters, which means that  browsers can't tell the server the charset they're using. Because of that, browsers basically POST back in the encoding they received (well, Netscape 4's a bit broken there, unsurprisingly). Of course, due to the poor UTF-8 support in older browsers, this means that for now we need to stick to ASCII (or some local charsets, such as ISO-8859-1). I got bitten by that already, badly.
</p>

<p>
  I'm looking for ways of dealing with this cleanly, any input in that area is very welcome.

The way to deal with it is to use HTML entities.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)/2
