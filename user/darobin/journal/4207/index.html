  Getting back into gear after ten or fifteen days (I'm afraid to count...) completely off the net (a number of those without even access to my computers) during which I had many things to do is hard. I'm late on just about anything, and it seems that as soon as I try to concentrate on one thing something else that's more important comes up as a reminder. And that's after I sat down and organized it all on paper for two hours. Chances are, I prolly won't sleep tonight in order to finish catching up with the most urgent stuff.
</p>

<p>
  Apart from that I took a glance at the OSCon schedule, and there are quite a few interesting talks in there. I'm glad I was selected, so many people I know would have delivered great talks weren't that I almost feel ashamed I'm there, and definitely feel an incentive to deliver something really good (I would have felt it anyway, but it gives it an extra edge). The only thing that bothers me is that it looks like all the interesting things that I want to see are in time conflicts. Notably, quite a few good things are running at the same time as I am, which means I won't even see one of them. But then, I'm certainly not complaining as there's no way I'd expect the organizers to make the schedule fit my preferences ;) Also, having conflicts in interesting things means that there are also some time areas in which I have nothing I want to see so that I'll get more chances of meeting the authors of the talks I missed (or didn't miss) at the bar for a bunch of beers and intersting talk ;)
</p>

<p>
  In fact, judging from last year's experience where the sessions were really good but the out-of-band and in-of-bar talking talks were even better, I'm surprised that O'Reilly doesn't market the "Beer Track" as that's definitely the best and most advanced of them all.

I have very fond memories of sitting on the deck by the pool with a lot of Perl people, shooting the breeze.  You're right, the beer track is one of the highlights of the conference.<p>

Speaking of which, who is surveying pubs and bars around the YAPC site in St Louis?</p><p>

  I haven't been fortunate enough to attend a YAPC thus far, and probably won't be this year, but if the Europe 2003 edition is in Paris as the Paris.pm folks are trying to plan it, I will certainly volunteer to help with the beer/wine track (beer is about as good in France as it is in the US).

  I don't believe I had a chance to bump into you at TPC last year (but then, perhaps I was already too drunk at that time to catch your name), if there's a chance this year, I'd love to buy you a beer<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;).
