  When the war started, I expected someone to call on to Belgium's courts' declared universal competence for war crimes, crimes against mankind, etc. and try to sue Bush the way it happened to Sharon and to a variety of people involved in the Rwanda genocide.
</p>

<p>
  I wondered how it was going to happen. Well, instead of waiting for something to go wrong in this war, people quite simply picked stuff from Oil War One, and are consequently <a href='http://www.lemonde.fr/article/0,5987,3462--313588-,00.html'>sueing Bush Sr., Powell, Cheney, and Schwartzkopf</a>[<em>Le Monde</em>, fr(eedom)] for the bombing of a shelter that killed 403 civilians.
</p>

<p>
  I guess there will be political pressure for it not to be instructed, but I was surprised it happened this quick. Belgium is, after all, where NATO resides :)

<p>
  The fact that people will press charges has nothing to do with the court itself. Once charges have been pressed, it is up to the court to see if it will instruct. I hardly find the fact that people will try to use the court for political motives surprising, and fail to see how that affects the ICC. Any court will have people come to it for a variety of reasons, some good some bad. It doesn't impact the fact that a court may or may not be a good idea. It also seems quite logical to me that crimes of very high gravity are not limited by frontier -- they concern us all -- even though I disagree with part of how Belgium has been doing it.
</p>

<p>
  I am not aware of all the charges the court has examined, some of those you suggest may have been submitted or may be currently explored. You are perfectly free to raise the court's attention on some of them. It proved quite efficient for Rwanda.

Many people see the Belgium statute a trial run for the ICC.  A three judge panel in Belgium certified the charges against Sharon recently, so it's gone beyond the state of just bringing the charges.<br> <p>The ICC is, or will be, an unaccountable institution that could be used for political punishment.  It's clear that people will try to use it for that, based on the example of Belgium. Courts in the US have various checks on their powers to protect against tyranny.<br> </p><p>I hope the US will continue to insist that Americans be subject to justice that has checks on its powers.<br> </p><ul><li><i>You are perfectly free to raise the court's attention on some of them.

After the UN failed to act, even after extensive pleading and in the face of mass genocide, we only have this court to try and pick up the pieces.  Is there any wonder Americans are leary of these "just" International Institutions?</p>

<p>
  The Belgium statute has nothing of a trial run for the ICC. It works according to belgian rules exclusively, which are subject to control from Belgium only. As notes in my previous comment, I am not totally in agreement with their choices, if only because Belgium's legal system has a number of loopholes.
</p>

<p>
  The fact that the charges against Sharon have been certified means that the judges consider there are reasons to investigate. Sharon remains presumed innocent, and it doesn't make other possible criminals involved in the same or similar actions innocent either.
</p>

<p>
  International Institutions are imperfect, that's hardly shocking news. Do you really want to enter a discussion of why the rest of the world is leery of "just" American Interventions?

<p>
  There are reasons why Kosovo was different, and one of them is that the Clinton administration never said they would take over and administrate the country, and use it for US companies to make money. Giving the opposition 30 million dollars is also a better way to get democracy.
</p>

<p>
  The Kosovo intervention was very very far from perfect though. You may wish to remember that at one point the Russians openly threatened to attack the Americans, and started moving troops in that direction. That the US bombed the Chinese embassy and used fragmentation bombs in civilian areas, killing many innocents. All this participates in the fact that a large part of the european public would like to see such interventions under sane control. With simple rules, such as "no fragmentation bombs on civilians". Everyone wants Saddam out, but very few trust W to do it with sanity. I wish it goes well, I just have <em>very</em> little hope.
</p>

<p>
  The Ivory Coast governement asked France to intervene. This is very different from invading a country (there are co-defense agreements). France had UN blessing and backing from the international community, notably neighbouring countries and the US. The country is still politically unstable, but much of the early warring has been put under control. We are far from a solution, but I think that the peace-keeping forces present on site -- because that's what they are, they're not a colonial army -- are helping.
</p>

<p>
  By the rest of the world I didn't mean France, I meant much of Europe, much of Asia, and most of Africa, the Middle-East, and South America. I'm probably forgetting some.

  I would be suspicious of "intelligence reports" that filtrate to the press at the exact right time, but anyway it has been a well known fact for ages that there are very high-profile weapon smugglers smuggling French weapons. They've been at it for years, some are probably French, some probably are not. A few years ago some of their leaders were caught but obviously there is enough money in that business that the network probably survived. As far as I'm aware, similar problems have occured in all major weapon-producing countries, and the French government and secret services seem to have been doing an honest job at stopping this. I can't comment on Russia as I am as yet insufficiently documented on that.
</p>

<p>
  All the stuff about so-called conflicting interests is propaganda, to call it something polite.
</p>

<p>
  What you call my "hysterical rhetoric" is based on the fact that US Army engineers are already talking with US oil biggies about who will get oil contracts, without asking anything to even their allies (source: LA Times). In the same time frame Grossman, of the W administration, has made profuse comments on who will control various things in Iraq, but refuse to answer regarding oil and construction, which is suspicious. London is working on two UN resolutions the prevent that, and it has caused some diplomatic turmoil between the two countries.
</p>

<p>
  As for the "take over" part, I don't believe you can be indoctrinated to the point that you are not aware that the US are pushing for Pentagon administration -- the Pentagon itself thought it suboptimal.
</p>

<p>
  I fail to see how you reach your "good cause" argument, it doesn't seem to relate to something I've said.
</p>

<p>
  Russia would not have vetoed the Kosovan war, they said so themselves. They were part of the negotiations to attack since day one, and they agreed on the principle. No one was stupid enough to think that it could be done without Russian agreement, UN veto or not. What they strongly objected to were American methods, which were causing way too much collateral damage. The point where they threatened to attack was when the Chinese embassy was blown up by three missiles coming from different directions (ie, not a guiding system problem but a deliberate hit at that position even if not at that building).
</p>

<p>
  Serious Consequences isn't listed as a synonym in my thesaurus. Maybe I need an American thesaurus.
</p>

<p>
  The French troops were pretty much already there before the crisis, IIRC much if not all of them are permanently stationned (France has close defense links with the Ivory Coast). They assisted civilians that were evacuating before being called for help, but only deployed as a peace-keeping force afterwards. At no time were they in breech of existing agreements with Ivory Coast.
</p>

<p>
  The current Ivorian government isn't the same one that asked for help, it's a national coalition more or less trying to keep the country stable. Some there resent the French, others don't. Most of the time it depends on whether they're happy with the outcome of the Marcoussis negotiations or if they think that continuing the war would have brought them more.
</p>

<p>
  I don't think the rest of the world wants the US to handle the NK issues, certainly not the way it's handled Iraq.
</p>

<p>
  Your "best interest" argument is specious, and about as fertile as a "why Iraq and not (endless list of possibly dangerous countries)?"
