  All that great family of people interested in pipelines might be interested in <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-pipeline/'>this new W3C Note</a>. It's just a Note (ie early alpha) and looks like it has a few faults, but I think it's interesting.

<h2>Funny, that</h2>

I just got finished flipping through <a href="http://xpipe.sourceforge.net/BinaryStuff/xpipeny.ppt" title="sourceforge.net">Sean McGrath's XPipe slides</a sourceforge.net> on the train the other day.  It's a bit high in the clouds, but it does give a good overview of pipelining, rigs and such.
<p>
It got me thinking that what we really need is an XML format for declaring pipelines, so that <tt>XML::Pipeline-&gt;create</tt> can instantiate all of the code needed to do the work, without actually writing Perl code.  Alternatively, <tt>XML::Pipeline-&gt;compile</tt> could take an XML description and produce a module that does what the pipeline definition says it should do.   Sorta like what Paul does to compile WSDL into a module.
</p><p>
I haven't read it yet, but Norm and Eve seem to be thinking about how the format should work.  That makes the job much easier.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

I've got XML::SAX::Machines emitting descriptions as XML and am planning to add the "build a machine from XML" part when I need it or at least get the time to.

<p>A couple of major differences between X::S::M and the XPipe stuff are that XPipe seems to be a specialized make/ant thing and that it's a lot higher level than X::S::M.  X::S::M is meant to make it easy to connect and manage SAX processors, while XPipe wants to manage the overall transformation process.

</p><p>I'd like to see X::S::M grow some XPipe like features, I'm considering a XMLMaker machine that would encompass/mimic most of the make-like dependancy solving functionality of "pipelines" as I understand them, and an AutoCache machine to allow the SAX events that float between SAX processors to act a lot like make(1) targets.</p>

From the little I understand about XPipe, it extends way beyond SAX filters.
<p>
For example, I'd expect XPipe to handle the case where data is coming in from DBI and into a SAX head conversion, passing through some filters, being converted into a DOM tree, munged and then ferried through an XSLT transform, to be re-serialized as SAX events to be filtered again and output thorough a tail conversion into another DBI connection.
</p><p>
I think.</p>

Nothing there SAX can't do...<br> <br>We're also looking at optimisations so that pseudo-SAX modules that have to serialise to a DOM can connect to each other directly by passing DOM trees, and bypass the SAX part (though still provide SAX for modules that don't grok DOM).

I'd expect XML::SAX::Machines to handle that case too<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:).  Either way would require custom SAX generator and handler modules (Java for XPipe, Perl for X::S::M) to do the DBI queries and we have XML::Filter::XSLT handy.

<p>It does seems like XML::Generator::FromDBI and XML::Handler::ToDBI would be handy modules.  I've written SAX modules before that store and retrieve XML as event lists (with unnecessary events omitted on store and recreated on retreival), so I know it's not too difficult.  Kind of like a DBIx::RecordSet for SAX, perhaps.</p>

Kip points out Matt's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/doc/MSERGEANT/XML-Generator-DBI-0.03/DBI.pm" title="cpan.org">XML::Generator::DBI</a cpan.org> module<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:).  So ziggy, when did you say you were going to CPAN XML::Handler::DBI?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
