  Today has definitely been a good Perl day. We eventually 
  sorted out the XML::SAX::Base bundling problem, by 
  relying on what was originally a bug in the XML::SAX
  distro. Base.pm being autogenerated by the Makefile.PL,
  it wasn't being picked up by CPAN. So thanks to that, it
  can be distributed both with XML::SAX and separately,
  provided that the XML::SAX::Base distro has a 
  pregenerated Base.pm (or a fake one). Kip Hampton did
  precisely that, and sent it to CPAN, wheee !
</p>

<p>
  In addition, for a quick encore, Kip went ahead and 
  committed PerlDOM to the SourceForge CVS so that we can 
  now all work on that together. I haven't had time to 
  delve into it, but it sure looks cool at first sight.
</p>

<p>
  Right in Kip's wake, Ken MacLeod added in his draft of 
  the PerlDOM spec. We'll now be able to sync it with the 
  SAX2 spec so that the two become as interoperable as 
  possible.
</p>

<p>
  Also, perl-xml saw a flurry of modules updates. 
  XML::Handler::Trees from Eric Bohlman, XML::Simple with
  bugfixes from Grant McLean, and XML::SAX::Simpler, a
  new version of Simple that groks SAX (if I understood
  correctly, I must say that I never used Simple).
</p>

<p>
  And all in all, it seems that the whole SAX enchilada is
  getting the attention that I think it deserves -- SAX 
  makes XML so much more easy to use. We even got some
  warm fuzzy kudos from a number of nice people :-)
</p>

<p>
  Oh, and Matt made some AxKit patches as well. I haven't 
  had time to follow those clearly, but it looks as if
  we're going to be able to ditch PerlHandler chains in
  favour of a new AxAddPlugin directive. That will 
  certainly make a few people's lives easier (including
  mine).
</p>

<p>
  Anyway... now there's more in the pipeline. Moving 
  XML::SAX::Expat ahead (first into completion, then into
  XS), creating XML::SAX::SVG{Expand,Contract} to switch
  between the standard and expanded syntax for paths (a
  long requested feature of the svg-dev folks), a release
  of CSS::SAC to match the updates in CVS (which are 
  numerous) accompanied by a few new patches and hopefully
  two new filters (including one that takes SAC in and SAX
  out to produce a nice XHTML display of a CSS file), and
  of course the accompanying SAC spec on which I'm working.
</p>

<p>
  Also, Tessera is starting to shape out, now with some of
  it's most fundamental classes being fleshed out in code.
  I hope to have something to show soon enough.
</p>

<p>
  I just hope that I didn't have to write these silly   
  documents for those real work things (but then, it puts
  beer on the table) and that my coffee machine would stop
  segfaulting (well, I don't really now what it does, but
  it sure crashes). If you know someone that designs
  appliance OSs at Moulinex, please give me their name and
  I'll be happy to forward it to the closest Mafia padres.

<h2>XHTML display of CSS</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2001-11-20T19:31:56</h3>
What exactly are you trying to accomplish with the XHTML view of CSS?  Pretty-printed CSS sources, or nicely rendered (XML|HTML) with CSS decorations in XML?
<p>
It sounds like the latter; from there, it should be trivial to also emit an XSL-FO version, suitable for printing.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
