  Last week-end, with Antoine and a bunch of other friends that don't blog here (or in fact anywhere -- they're some of those people from real life) we hopped to Cabourg in Normandy for some fun at a friend's place.
</p>

<p>
  The time we had was delightful. Lots of drinking and belotte tournaments of which, for the first time in my life I won not only one game (which would already be a first) but <em>all</em> games. It was a true pleasure to crush Antoine's team flat thrice after him being so obnoxious for ever since I started playing belotte. We also barbequed lots, and then drank some more. 
</p>

<p>
  The tougher parts involved playing football (I mean real football, not the one where people wear protection and can't run for more than five seconds in a row because no one can see where the ball is in the melee or which side they're supposed to score on). I can't say I've done much in the way of sports since I stopped skiiing (ie moved out of Grenoble) and while I still look sufficiently in shape to fool myself into believing I am, it's clearly not true. Running on the beach is hard, and today my entire body is aching. But well, it was great and I look forward to more week-ends in the not-too-distant future. Except perhaps the next ones will involve more minigolf and a little less running around ;)
