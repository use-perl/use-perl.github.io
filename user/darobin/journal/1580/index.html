  Saturday night I had my housewarming party. Well, given the fact that I moved in about 14 months ago it's not exactly a housewarming party, but I wanted to silence the continual sarcasm according to which when my housewarming party happened, if it ever did, would most likely be a housecooling one, if not a dance-in-the-ashes-of-the-house party.
</p>

<p>
  As in most of the parties I make, I end up being rather glad that half of the people I invited didn't show up, even those that called an hour before to say they would. My own personal approach to gatecrashing means that at least three quarters of the people that show up are people I don't know, and that were invited by the folks that didn't turn up. I like that, it's a lot more fun than just seeing the usual suspects around. If one day everyone and their friends do show up, we'll probably have to break into the neighbours place to have enough space.
</p>

<p>
  In order to give the party an edge, I decided I was going to learn how to do Mojitos right, and serve some throughout the night. Mojitos aren't hard, but there's a knack to squashing the line, sugar and mint together properly. Of course, I had to spend the afternoon practising.
</p>

<p>
  I think that mojito theme was instrumental in having the party finish at 4, instead of the more usual 6. The small table I was using to make them was quickly overwhelmed with requests, so that we had to send out people to raid local stores for rum, lime, mint and Perrier (all of which at different times, and in a totally uncoordinated fashion of course). Soon after that it turned into a Mojito learning sessions, and not long later there were half a dozen happily squashing mojitos away.
</p>

<p>
  Teaching Mojito-art is hard, because you have to taste so many of them. Thankfully, the students were really good so that I could soon enough enjoy the peaceful retirement of collapsing into my girlfriend's arms (at least, I hope they were my girlfriend's) and babbling joyously about various incredibly great ideas that hopefully will never live to see the light of day outside that special dimension in which party-ideas live.
</p>

<p>
  It took me the whole of sunday and a fair part of today to get over that. I'm glad that tonight is going to be a quiet restful night with the "biggest party ever organised by JazzValley"... About a hundred people, endless rows of bottles, some of the finest jazz musicians partying, and some cool people I know like for instance Eric Cholet (the JazzValley.com site is a mod_perl site on which I, amongst others, worked). Oh well, I might as well call it an off week.
</p>

<p>
  This leads me to wonder if we should have a Mojito session at OSCon... I guess I should ask Gnat &lt;g>
