  It is sometimes funny how one can be brutally reminded of the cruel beauty of some poetry, through paths most improbable. If you don't know <a href='http://www.cs.rice.edu/user/ssiyer/minstrels/txt/677.txt'>this poem</a>, I recommend its reading. It's quite deceivingly simple. 
</p>

<p>
(ObPedantic: most sites list it as "Villanelle" but my f&amp;f has it as "But I Can't". It is however a perfect villanelle, except for the penultimate line which is slightly off on purpose).

Very good, but it can't hold a candle to <i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>, which is probably the best villanelle ever written by a comfortable margin.

  Bah. I'll concede that Do not go gentle is a much better villanelle as such, but it's a lesser poem<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;) (though still very good).
</p>

<p>
  I'd completely forgotten about villanelles. I'm currently spending my afternoon writing some instead of Java, and they're of course a lot more fun despite (or perhaps because) their being a lot more B&amp;D. It's a perfect form for when you haven't slept and no more than two ideas can fit into your brain<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

I have to disagree about it being the lesser poem as well. But taste's like that.

<h2>Auden!</h2>

Auden is my favourite poet, by a very long shot.  Not only was he able to move easily between comedy and tragedy, he was a master of form.  I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679731970" title="amazon.com">
"Collected Poems"</a amazon.com> in the mid-90s and it has well repaid the investment.<p>

<p>That wouldn't have been shortly after seeing <i>Four Weddings and a Funeral</i> would it? That seems to be when most people bought it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
