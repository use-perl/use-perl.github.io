  Expway is laying off four people for economic reasons. I don't have the details as yet but from the shape of it, it looks as if despite the fact that we are having an increasing market penetration the share holders want to lower the burn rate. They probably negotiated that as part of the recent round of funding we had.
</p>

<p>
  This sucks bad. I'm not on the wagon but the three of the four people that are on it are people I really like. Worse, one of them is a fellow research engineer with whom I have been having a lot of fun and who's really good at his job. He has much more experience in R&amp;D than I, and has been in the company since its early days. I'm happy I'm not laid off, but I feel guilty because I'm basically the only remaining hired research engineer (we were four in research staff, that guy -- Enzo --, my boss, a guy that now only comes here one day a week because he works the rest of the time on his thesis on wavelets, and I). I'm not worried about him finding another job, but I would feel the world a fairer place if I hadn't joined Expway in the first place.
</p>

<p>
  There's no way around it, layoffs suck.
