  I've only started seriously using Mozilla's keyboard-based navigation features recently, but just as it was for tabs I am now completely lost when it doesn't work and when it's not there. I always looked funny at people that over-used their mice (eg going to "File" then "Quit" instead of the keyboard shortcut to kill/close or at least the corresponding window decoration), now I look weird at people that use them to surf the Web. I can't help thinking they must have some kind of problem.
</p>

<p>
  The principle is simple: you hit some keys and it matches them within any link. Hitting enter will activate the link (Ctrl+Enter for a new tab if that option is set). Starting with "/" will make it search throughout the entire text, which is less innovatively useful but more natural than Ctrl+F. You will quickly realise that two letters is what is needed at most for the better part of your browsing. Otherwise, F3 is your friend.

<p>
  I wish they had something similar for forms, I still have to use my mouse to get to those when they're too many tabs away...

<h2>Keyboard shortcuts</h2>

I love keyboard shortcuts, and the first thing I do when I have to start using a new app, or new version of an old app, is that I FREAK OUT when the keyboard shortcuts are different.  I put off upgrading Netscape for almost two years because I got so burnt by the whole keyboard interaction in the early NS5's being different and broken.
<p>Here's my new meme: Tell programmers that you heard? this one time at band camp?  that if you break keyboard bindings between versions (i.e., if what worked in version N doesn't work anymore in N+1), then you get AUTOMATICALLY INDICTED under the <a href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Society/Issues/Disabilities/Laws/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act/" title="google.com">A.D.A.</a google.com>
and then you get sentenced to community service that consists of people with wheelchairs running you over with their big custom vans.  And it's true because it happened to a guy you knew at your last job's friend!</p>

  Yes yes yes! We need to start spreading the urban myth!
</p>

  I also don't understand why all apps don't have a way to configure shortcuts to your liking. Most KDE apps have that (though there needs to be a named action for things that you want to configure). I think there is little that I want more DEAD than Ctrl+Q in Mozilla. Each time I hit it by mistake it kills my twenty open tabs, the mail I was writing/reading, and all my IRC sessions. It's HELL!
