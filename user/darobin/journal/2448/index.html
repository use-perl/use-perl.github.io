  A few days ago, I started receiving love SMSs from an unknown person. The number is always the same, though I don't know who it is.
</p>

<p>
  On the first night, I had a conversation with that person (which claims to be a woman, but I really don't know) from 2am to 430am. The next day it picked up again at some point between 10 and noon. And it's kept going since, by short bursts.
</p>

<p>
  You migth wonder why I bother answering... well, it picked my curiosity. I want to get as much data back so that I can track down who it is. The writing style and even more so the type of mistakes made allowed me to eliminate a number of people I know. I also tried fishing with references, and have found out that it's someone that appears to have at least a minimal knowledge of who I am, but that doesn't get a few cultural refs. So that's another bunch of people out.
</p>

<p>
  In fact, part of the problem is that I've managed to eliminate a fair number of people but still haven't reached any conclusion as to who it is. Most of the people that I suspected have been innocented by various techniques. I'm starting to think that it may actually be serious, but I really don't know who would be crazy enough to attempt seduction over SMS.
</p>

<p>
  If any of you know of a way to reverse lookup an SFR (one of the french mobile telcos) number, I'd be delighted to know.
</p>

<p>
  PS: yes I tried calling that number, from various phones (ie not only mine) but no one ever picks up and the answering machine is the factory default one, that only gives the number and no actual name. If this was done on purpose, it's scary.
</p>

  Hehe, yes I know this kind of approach. It's a typical thing to do when you hate someone. A friend of mine was listed by his ex girlfriend in the Paris list of flats to rent with a very attractive description, right at the start of the flat-searching season (summer). His phone was unusable for two months and would ring continuously if he plugged it in.
</p>

<p>
  What I'm facing however is not as problematic<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) To being with it's only one person dropping SMSs, no big deal, no big bother either. I can tell my phone to filter that number out if I want to. I'm not afraid, I live in a neighbourhood in which I know every one, I have rudimentary self-defense knowledge, etc... If it goes on too long I might become bored with it. But for the moment I'm mostly curious. Curious as in 1) if it's a joke, I want to track down who did it in order to strike back someway with a twisted idea of mine, or 2) if that person's serious, she obviously has a problem, in which case I'd like to help.
</p>

<p>
  Now, I sure hope no one puts me on a stipper service<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
