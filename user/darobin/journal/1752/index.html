  Tonight is Knowscape's Winter Party. Like most other Knowscape parties, chances are that it will be rather wild. Last time we had one we had 20 confirmed people coming five hours before it started, and we ended up with 80 people being present at any given time during the party (which probably means many more overall).
</p>

<p>
  As I'm writing, five hours to the actual start of the party, we have 42 people confirmed (yes, 42, I'm not making it up). I can only hope that there won't be over 160 people at any given time because I can only make so many Mojitos before I'm too drunk to tell a lime from an ashtray. Oh well, I guess I tought enough people how to make Mojitos at my last party so that maybe they'll be able to stand in for me while I try to make out with the laser printer.
</p>

<p>
  Anyway, as a <em>use Perl;</em> reader, you are invited too. The party's tonight at around 20:30, in Paris (11th district). Just drop me a mail before 20:00 Paris time if you want details on how to come. You just need to bring a little to drink (but not necessarily much, we've already planned for quite a few people). We're already packed with aspirin, ibuprofen, and betaine citrate so you can leave those home in case you make it back there before it's over.
</p>

If you're stocking up on aspirin and ibuprofin, why not add a small jar of Marmite for good measure?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

  Not a bad idea, though it is quite hard to get hold of in France, and my stock ran out earlier the year<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) Also, it would really have to be Vegemite to make me happy.

Yes, vegemite really does taste better, but it's  difficult to find here in the states.  You can find Marmite here in some supermarkets though; specialty shops will occasionally stock Vegemite, and tend to circulate their stock about once every two years...

  Haha, well I guess it's a good thing that it takes forever for Vegemite to decay (some sources pretend that it's half-life is superior to that of some of the more enduring atoms). Vegemite is impossible to find in France, though we can import Marmite from the UK. When the dotcom craze picks up again, maybe you and I should get together to set up worldwide distribution of it ?
