  After an email to dahut.pm, one to perl-xml, and a final one to axkit-users, I am now ridded of all my CPAN modules. To put it in PAUSE's exquisite wording, <em>"Sorry, there are no modules registered belonging to RBERJON."</em>
</p>

<p>
  It's been a fun bunch of years being a CPANian, and I can safely say that a lot that I learnt about, heck, more than just computerish stuff has been learnt in the process of putting stuff up there and maintaining it.
</p>

<p>
  But things change and people's interests with them. Perl was my first love and I won't forget it. Nothing I do for work involves Perl even remotely (in fact, very little involves actual coding). What little development I do in my spare time is all oriented around UI-level technologies (SVG, XForms, etc). While there are excellent packages out there in Perl for that sort of stuff (Wx, CamelBones, ...) it's not Perl's forte, and at this point in time I'm using Objective-C most of the time. I'll admit that ObjC's Smalltalkish features also help there -- had Perl 6 been around I would probably be using that instead.
</p>

<p>
  I would like to send a big heartfelt and thankful hug to all that have directly or indirectly contributed to CPAN and the stuff I enjoyed putting up there, whether it be with patches, suggestions, beer, rants and bitching, bug reports, or kamikaze shots at 3am in a hotel patio. Be sure to keep it up!
</p>

I realize that all you are doing is giving your packages new homes where they'll get the attention they deserve; not really leaving the Community.
</p>
<p>
Still, I can't help thinking back a couple of years to a time spent firing code, encouragement, and streams of obscenities back and forth via email to give birth to XML::SAX::Base-- and being a bit sad that such days are unlikely to come again anytime soon.

<p>
  Yes, I certainly won't leave the community -- even though there are other very nice communities out (I'm thinking most notably of the SVG community, where people are delightful), I can't see myself straying away from those wonderful people I know here that have become much more than just co-hackers.
</p>

<p>
  I am very certainly a bit sad that things like the SAX n-oika days are gone, I get that heart pinch especially when thinking of the obscenities<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;) But the redistributon of modules is unrelated to that, whether I redistribute them or not, I'm simply not able to participate in that sort of development in the foreseeable year or so. That being said, I fully expect to need to deal with the server-side of things again some day, and fully expect that that will involve Perl. I've also heard of a nice sounding little project called Colony....
