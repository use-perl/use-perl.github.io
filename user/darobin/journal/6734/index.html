  I'm just back from OSCon, with a flight arriving today early afternoon. I can't muster the courage to describe the week right now. I know I should've done it as it went by, but I was too busy having a good time.
</p>

<p>
  I think I'll try to write it all down tomorrow if I've recovered from the jet lag, brain overheat, and excessive drinking. In the meantime I'd like to deeply thank the people that were there for the great time we had together, as well as Nat and all the folks that worked on the conference for making it such a wonderful event (as well as for tossing that hotel room my way, it really is much more fun being in the conference hotel). I hope you've all made it home safe and that I'll see you all next year (or, with any luck, earlier than that).
