The AxKit Has Been Drinking<br>
---------------------------<br>
 (to the tune of Tom Waits' _The Piano Has Been Drinking_)<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The AxKit has been drinking<br>
My mod_perl is asleep<br>
And the segfaults went back to New York<br>
XSP has to make a leak<br>
And the config needs a haircut<br>
And the DOM tree looks like it might break<br>
Cause TLH's out of cigarettes<br>
And have_lib is on the make<br>
And my AxKit has been drinking<br>
My AxKit has been drinking<br>
 <br>
And the ASPs are all freezing<br>
And the CGI's blind in one eye<br>
And you can't template the other<br>
And Blueberry's got encoding aide<br>
And strings are just so '90s<br>
And my AxKit has been drinking<br>
My AxKit has been drinking<br>
 <br>
Cause XML's like a sumo wrestler<br>
Pointy brackets french roast<br>
And XSL's cool for widgets<br>
With the params of a form post<br>
Cause my AxKit has been drinking<br>
My AxKit has been drinking<br>
 <br>
And you can't find your baudster<br>
With a comment counter<br>
And he XPathes you and your friends<br>
And pages just can't get served<br>
Without him<br>
 <br>
And the office box is drooling<br>
And the benchmarks are on fire<br>
And schemata are pluraling<br>
And the transforms have recursed<br>
And my AxKit has been drinking<br>
My AxKit has been drinking<br>
My AxKit has been drinking<br>
Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me.

  See ? AxKit is so mindnumbingly cool that it even has a song :)

<p>Depending on your regional american accent....it might sound like 'my ass kits been drinkin' or maybe 'my ass skits ben drinkin'</p>

<p>I thought AxKit was supposed to make you bouncy and happy...not hunched over your beer at the bar in a smoky dive<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Rewrite it to 'Warm Beer, Cold Women'<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

  I guess I'm glad I don't have an american accent then, and I'll have to be cautious on my next world tour.
</p>

<p>
  As for what AxKit does to me, it does make me "bouncy and happy". It's just that my idea of being bouncy and happy is to be hugging a warm beer in a smoky, ugly, evil dive<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) AxKit did that *a*lot* to me last summer.
