<h2>CNN</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vek/">vek</a> on 2003-02-20T18:16:59</h3>
Yeah, there was a <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/2/16/211910/416" title="kuro5hin.org">discussion</a kuro5hin.org> over at <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/" title="kuro5hin.org">kuro5hin</a kuro5hin.org> about this very topic.  Amongst the 'CNN is just a part of the Bush propaganda machine' posts was an alternative <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/comments/2003/2/16/211910/416/62#62" title="kuro5hin.org">conspiracy theory</a kuro5hin.org>:<br> <br> <i>Instead of the usual "CNN is predominantly  " rants, how about another theory: CNN wants a war. No, not because they support Bush ( a couple years ago they were called the clinton news network by some folks, make up your mind on who cnn favors ) , but because it boosts ratings.<br> <br>When Persion Gulf War v1.0 broke out, CNN was on the frontlines. Everybody praised them as being the "leaders" and that they finally "came into their own". Hell, they even made a movie about it. But 12 years has passed, CNN is getting stomped by FOX News Network, etc etc, and jobs are getting cut. So do you think that CNN wont jump on a chance to get their name out in front again?....</i>



<h2>Missles</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2003-02-22T17:10:12</h3>
<em>What do you know, next we might be finding out that unloaded missiles fly a little farther than when loaded. SHOCKING!!!</em> <br> <br>Note, however, that Blix in his Feb. 14 presentation said, unequivocally, that those missles are prohibited.  Resolution 687 doesn't say one word about "fully loaded" missles.  It just says that if they have a range of over 150km -- without qualification, so we must assume it is under any conditions, unless a subsequent resolution added qualification -- they are prohibited.  Following the letter of the Resolution -- which it is Blix's job to do -- those missles are simply prohibited, and Iraq can either show the world, to some degree, that it is willing to comply with resolutions, or not.  Right now.<br>

  Yes, but I'm not surprised that, missing qualification, each party would interpret it its way. No need to stretch words, any proper missile tech sheet will give you range at min and max loads. Whoever specified 150km without adding "at max load" is sorrily incompetent.

<em>Whoever specified 150km without adding "at max load" is sorrily incompetent.</em> <br> <br>Why?  Without qualification, it means "at min load" by default.  We don't need to question how to interpret it.  There's no room for equivocation.  The wording is not unclear.<br> <br>It's a simple boolean.  Either it can exceed 150km, or it cannot.  It can, by everyone's admission, including Iraq's.  It is therefore proscribed, and Iraq must therefore destroy them, all their major related parts, and their repair and production facilities.

  An unloaded missile is a civilian rocket<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

  I'm well in favour of destroying iraqi missiles (in fact, any missile), it's just that the reaction of some that started shouting "LOOK LOOK THEY'RE CHEATING WE'VE GOT PROOF" when those came out was laughable, and betrays a will to go to war that goes beyond the hunt for WMDs.

Well, I don't have that reaction, so I can't really speak to it much, except to say that I agree with you, I think:  I recognize these missiles are prohibited, clearly, by the letter of prevailing UN Resolutions; I do not, however, think that they substnatively change anything in regards to what is happening.<br> <br>It is just one more example of Iraq not cooperating if they do not destroy them.  If they do destroy them, they are still not cooperating in many significant ways (both Blix and El Baradei are still saying that Iraq is failing to provide evidence it is required to provide, and failing to allow them to conduct interviews they are required to allow).  Unless all those other material breaches are turned around, these missiles will not be the hinge on which war turns.  Even if Iraq complies to the UN's satisfaction in every way apart from these missiles, at that point destroying the missiles will not require war, because a couple of bombing runs will destroy them and end it all.<br> <br>But make no mistake, these missiles do represent a very clear breach of prevailing UN Resolutions.  The inspectors and their experts have agreed unanimously on this point (well, not that they are a breach, specifically, but that the weapons are prohibited).  The text of the resolution leaves no logical room for equivocation.  They are prohibited.  It is not that war hinges on the missiles; it is just that this is a very clear example of a breach that people can point to, if they are not destroyed.  It is easier for people to understand missiles than it is to understand interviews or missing evidence.<br> <br>Note that the Bush administration has not used the missiles as you say, either.  This weekend, they echoed pretty much the sentiment I described above, that I can tell.<br>
