  It's been much longer than usual since I last posted to this journal. The reason for this is that I've been fighting back reality to try and get out of the financial red, while at the same time still finishing off some work that I'd promised I'd do but  haven't had sufficient time to finish (it's pay-work, but it won't pay anywhere near enough for me to be able to concentrate on that without looking everywhere for other immediate money resources).
</p>

<p>
  The very latest pieces of trouble are that since Knowscape is down my tax deadline moved from early May to last week, which was rather unpleasant, and that my bank has cancelled my main account, which means that I'll have to work on alternatives whenever I get some money. Besides that there's a leak somewhere at home that's dripping in my neighbour's flat but as I can't pay for the repairs I have to wait for my insurance to get its shit together. Of course, in the meantime my neighbour wants to kill me, and has started to take action to have my water cut off. A few other nasty things have occured, but I'm not sure it's worth going into the details. I'll update on the recent events (not all of which are bad ;) in further journals as I find it easier to read small and focussed bits than large entries.
