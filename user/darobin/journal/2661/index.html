  YAY!!! I received my laundry machine / drier this morning, my life will never be the same !!! No more hanging around boring laundromats, no more "damnit it's monday morning, I forgot to go to the laundromat and I got nothing to wear". HAHAHAHA.
</p>

<p>
  This, of course, may surprise the most equiped of you. I must admit that I'm completely underequiped, not having even enough furniture to fill my apartment. I spent the better part of the past seven years (when I left my parents' place) moving between countries and continents, and/or being broke because I was trying to get my company off the ground. Whatever I acquired, I had to sell at some point either because it wasn't worth moving accross oceans, or because I needed money to pay the rent (once I even had to sell most of my book collection -- which included a fair number of out-of-print philosophy and poetry books -- keeping only a few ones that were very dear to me just to avoid being kicked out on the street, something which remains a rather painful memory). Having to buy a third of the company didn't help much either last year.
</p>

<p>
  So the end produce of this is that I have pretty much nothing. The very minimum required to cook, a fridge, a stereo, basic furniture, and now a washer/drier (thanks to my parents' good sense of practical imagination last xmas) !!! Now if that isn't a massive improvement to my lifestyle, I don't know what is ;-)

<h2>The Joy of Appliances</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2002-02-05T15:09:01</h3>
<p>One summer in St. Louis when I was working 2 jobs to keep the bills paid I didn't have any spare money to buy a refridgerator or a stove [ apartments usually didn't come with appliances ] so I had to go down the street to buy a cold drink on a 30C+ day. I broke down and bought a cooler and would fill it with dry ice from the lab and drinks that would last a few days<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:). And having a washer and dryer in home is luxurious even now after so many years. I am already lamenting their loss when we move to Finland as there are few, if any, appliances I can take with me. I'm hoping I won't be lost in the local Finnish laundromat watching the clothes dry wondering which button is which<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Start a load of laundry at 2am just because you can<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

  It's a luxury for me too, which is why I was so overjoyed when my parents told me that it was my present<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
</p>

<p>
  If what I hear from my Finnish friends is true, it would seem that Finland is the country of the home appliance. They seem to have very cool new ideas there, and apparently people have those cool new ideas at home. I don't know if it means that homes come furbished with them already or not but some of those really sounded cool. On the other hand, I'm sure the laundromat programs have some of those uniquely finnish lovely names, you could probably try singing them out to keep yourself entertained while the laundry dries<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<p>
  Oh, you know, I am <em>so</em> going to do that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-) I think... I think I'll do that tonight while sipping a nice <em>vuln&eacute;raire</em> and rocking myself to the sound of the laundry rotating quietly to itself.
