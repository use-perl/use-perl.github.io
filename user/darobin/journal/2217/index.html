  I've long been a member of the french Parti Socialiste (the main left-wing party) but only recently did I find out that they had a <a href='http://www.temps-reel.net'>purely virtual section</a> which also serves as a think tank for computer and internet related ideas.
</p>

<p>
  I must say that so far I've been rather impressed with the quality of the discussion there, and with the impact of their ideas on the rest of the Parti Socialiste. As an example, three of their ideas just made it to the PS's program for next year's election (since the last administration a political program has become something ~80% of which is followed by action, which has been a nice improvement on prior unheld promises, irrespective of party. Of course, we've still got to work on the remaining 20%).
</p>

<p>
  The first idea is the ban of all software patents. That is incredibly good news as the Europe, under US pressure, has been seriously considering accepting them. The second one is to sponsor a computer and internet connection for all households under a certain revenue level that have a child in secondary school (15-18 years old) in order to reduce the digital divide and to gradually replace the Minitel (the Minitel is some sort of internet with dedicated terminals that has existed in France since the 80s. The terminals themselves were originally given away for free, while the connection was paid for. It was tremedously succesful, with all sorts of e-commerce, chat, porn, bank, administration, etc. "sites"). The third one is to pass a law favouring Open Source in the administration to cut down costs, increase security, and steer clear of backdoors. It's already been dubbed "La Loi Linux" (The Linux Law) by the press.
</p>

<p>
  As you an guess, I am even more eager than before to see the PS win this year's elections (one for presidency, the other for parliament; in other words the two most important elections in France). Defeat would set us back a few years (on other subjects as well, notably justice and professional education).
</p>

<p>
  And the funniest thing (for me): I just found out that one of the guys that's part of this section is the one that created the CMS for the Parti Socialiste :-) There's an IRL meeting tonight (something rare) and I hope he'll be there, we ought to have a few things to talk about ;-)

<h2>Digital divide?</h2>

<p>(<b>Warning:</b> this is not articulate. Just points
for discussion. That's something we could discuss at some Paris.pm meeting, maybe?)</p>
<p>Don't you think the so-called "digital divide"
is just another buzzword in the general "France is lagging
behind" trend? I suppose cheap terminals in homes
is less stupid than computers in school, but still...  Anyway, giving Minitels away was a very good idea, and it's cool to see it carried on.</p>
<p>As for computers in school, I think it's stupid. Period. That's where you'll best see the so-called "digital divide": kids with a computer at home will probably rate better than the other (poorer?) ones. And if the people who want computers in school really think that stuff needs to be learned so soon, they are wrong.</p>
<p>Did we learn how to use a telephone or a TV set
at school? A VCR? A hammer? No. Why? These are tools, built to be usable by the largest audience.
(OK, computer are not quite there yet, but manufacturers should work harder on this. Look at how easy to use was the minitel, for example.)
They are (or will be) part of our everyday life.
That's how everyone see them in the future: ubiquitous.
The people that most want computers in school are
mesmerized by software and hardware dealers. Or they are the dealers themselves. That's all. Later you can learn about the "professional tools", as a hobby or because of the trade you
have chosen.</p>
<p>The very cool thing about French education is
that we are taught general matters, such as
history, math, foreign languages... until at least 14 (18 in general). You don't
learn about the specifics of your future carrier
until later. By then, you are able to have a
broader view on things (hopefully). I think this is a Good Thing.</p>
<p>Think how many books the budget for one computer can buy. If kids know how to look for information in books, library, they will easily
learn how to look for it on the internet. The
keyword is "learn how to search", not library or computer.
</p> <p>...</p>
<p>Well, uh, sorry about that. It's just that I can't stand the words
"digital divide".<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>;-)</tt></p>

<p>
  I don't know if I made the point clear in my journal, and anyway that point was vastly clarified in an amendment made at yesterday's meeting. Here are a few (inarticulate as well<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-) clarifications:
</p>

<p>
  <em>Digital divide</em> was my word, not that of the program. I had a look at a few numbers yesterday and the main point on which France is lagging is in equipment of households. For the rest, France is doing either as well or better than other european countries. What I meant by digital divide is exactly what you said: kids with a computer at home have stronger chances of success than other kids, a majority of which are already poorer. This gap however is mostly clear in secondary school, and university. Earlier, other factors seem to take over (such as access to books). Honestly, I can't stand the word either and am very wary of how it is used. It is however an existing word that has its share of reality, at least for those that know what they're talking about.
</p>

<p>
  That's why the brunt of the idea is to 1) provide a computer to <em>households</em> that have a kid in secondary school and are under a given revenue level (probably those that are entitled to the "allocation rentr&eacute;e"), and 2) provide a lease for laptops to university students. The lease will be cofinanced by the state and will make a laptop available to them (which they'll eventually own at the end of the lease) for less than &euro;15 a month. The reason that a laptop is preferred here is that it works much better with student lifestyle.
</p>

<p>
  As for computers in schools, I 95% agree (and so does the program). The test projects to put a computer on every desk in schools are stupid and useless, and by no means should schools cease to be general and become cyberformation centers. There are a few points for which I think they are useful however, it's all a question of knowing what to use them for. Thankfully, people have learnt from the vast computers-in-all-schools Mitterand plan, which was in many parts a failure.
</p>

<p>
  One point where the computer can be useful is in coll&egrave;ge and lyc&eacute;e, available for a few special tasks here and there. There don't need to be many, just a few to fill some needs. Another point where they can be useful is in primary schools. The idea here is not to teach kids how to use a computer, but to provide them with a strict minimal familiarity with them. Enough to know that a keyboard is something you type on, and to avoid people shaking a mouse in the air and calling it a mulot<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-) It's sad but there are still people like that today and it's not limited to the president. Some of them are young. Even having the faintest idea of how such a beast operates can go a long way imho. Again, this doesn't require many computers, just the small lot that kids can rotate on to get familiar with the basics.
</p>

Even If I'm not a PS fan (In fact I'm not a politic fan<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br/><br/>This kind of commitment could get my vote...<br/><br/>To my mind you should communicate more on this.
I see a lot of users petition against software patents here in France, but as far as I know very few politics talk about it (except maybe Noel Mamere which invited Stallman ?)

<p>From what I understood, the PS more or less "stole" the idea of running against software patents from Noel Mamere...</p>

<p>
  Yes and no<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-) There's far more communication between the two parties than is usually made public by the press (or worse, the TV). They are, after all, trying to come up with a common program.
</p>

<p>
  The idea has been around for a while in both parties. People that have common interests on both sides often talk. I don't know who had the idea first though. In any case from what I've heard, the PS has a Perlian approach to programs. If someone has a good idea, "steal" it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<p>
  It's hard to get politicians to talk about it, simply because apart from a few, they're mostly ignorant of such problems. They accept the fact that they have competent councilors to deal with this (Jean-No&#235;l Tronc is a good example of such a councilor). Also, quite a few politicians think it's an elitist concern, a problem for the rich. Explaining to them that what may now be a problem of a happy few will be a problem for everyone in a few years time is hard, and it takes time. I know Jospin has gotten that, but there are many others to convince.
</p>

<p>
  So the point is, if the PS-Vert-etc coalition is elected, it'll happen because the councillors that will be in charge want it (I was at a work meeting for amendments to the project yesterday and several were present. They're almost more hardcore Open Source folks than I!). But getting professional politicians to talk about it is an uphil battle. They don't want to alienate the vote of people that have far more life-threatening problems.
</p>

<p>
  The campaign is going to be very short (90 days left) which doesn't leave much time to spread such information. There already was a small article in <em>Lib&eacute;ration</em> about it, and it's also the reason why Mam&egrave;re went to Autrans and invited Stallman. His electorate is more open to such questions, and well, it's an alliance of parties<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
</p>

<p>
  I'm not here to convince or proselytise. I'd hate to use <em>use Perl</em> for that. I'm just stating my ideas and things I think are cool. But if you want the idea to get through, nothing keeps you from spreading the word<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
