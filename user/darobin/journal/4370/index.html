  The final results are there:
</p>

<pre>
  Chirac [Mafia]    19.88%
  Le Pen [Nazi]     16.86%
  Jopsin [PS]       16.18%
</pre>

<p>
  Yes, that's right, 0.68% is what separates Jospin from getting into the second round (and most likely winning) from fascism taking his seat there. That's probably enough to make one wish we used the same voting system they have in the US, at least we could have kept our hopes up counting chads for a while...
</p>

<p>
  I had wanted to get things done today, especially a very large mail backlog, but I can't find the taste for working...
</p>

<p>
  <strong>[update]</strong>: 0.68% is 194.558 people. Contrast that with abstention at 28.4% (over 10 million people) and the 10% that voted for left-wing tourists (circa 3 million people) and you might start being bitter...

Maybe our politicians will change their way to treat the people (We aren't THAT stupid).<br>
May be they'll now take care of what we want...<br>
<br>
However I must admit I was ashamed to be french when I saw the results...<br>
I keep on hoping that It was mainly a way to show opposition to the whole political world<br>
 (Damn ! I can't believe 20% of the french people are fascist !)<br>
<br>
I wanted to vote 'blank' on the second turn, I'll now vote to stop M. LE PEN.<br>

<p>
  I sure hope that something good will come out. However this wasn't the right way to show discontent, the parliamentary elections would have been far better (because far less dangerous in many ways).
</p>

<p>
  As someone that has always tried to help pull the PS more towards the left, I know that I'll take this as a chance to get them to move better.
