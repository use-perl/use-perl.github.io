<p>In spite of my ever-growing day-job work-load,
I've finished to read the <i>Cryptonomicon</i>. There are plenty of reviews of
this book available on the wnebt, so I won't bother you with mine. Shortly : I
liked the book, (and the plot holes it contains, that will lead me into buying
the upcoming <i>Baroque Cycle</i>). There is, however, a flaw, in my humble
opinion : for an unknown reason, Stephenson doesn't appear to like one of his
main characters, Randall L. Waterhouse (the Unix guru). Consequently, reading
the lengthy chapters about him, his life and his thoughts, is mostly boring or
uncomfortable. Randy is shallow. I got the impression that Stephenson was
trying to tell something interesting about a hero he didn't found interesting
himself.
<p>I'm now reading <i>Senilit&aacute;</i>, a proustian novel written by
Italo Svevo at the very end of the XIXth century.</p>

<p>
Svevo was a contemporary and friend of Joyce during his time in Trieste. I read a short book about their relationship called "Joyce in Svevo's Garden".

In fact, I'm reading this book because I've read somewhere that Joyce did love
Svevo's novels, and I trust Joyce about literature. (...remembering that scene
in <i>Ulysses</i> where Bloom wipes his ass out with some mediocre short story
published in a newpaper.)
