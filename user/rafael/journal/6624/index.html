<p>Yes, a Perl parser, something that takes some Perl 5 source code and that produces an abstract syntax tree. <b>And it works.</b><p>Of course, this is based on an Evil Hack. The Evil Hack is to parse the output of <code>perl -c -DTp</code>. (You'll need a perl compiled with <code>-DDEBUGGING</code> for this to work.) These debug flags make perl output traces for any tokenizer and parser actions.
<p>So, based on the traces, I can reconstruct the functioning of an LALR(1) parser, that "shadows" perl's parser (you know, shifts, reduces, and reading a new token symbol).
<p>Drawbacks :
<ul><li>You need <code>-DDEBUGGING</code>.
<li>Perl's tokenizer is very clever. It can produce fake (zero-length) tokens or permute some token in the input stream. You don't want to know about how it tokenizes <code>"abc$def"</code>.
<li>For the moment I can't always get the part of the input source that's associated with some tokens. (If I find out that some information is missing, I'll patch the debug traces in the core!)
<li>If your Perl script outputs something like "<i>yydebug: after reduction, shifting from state 23 to state 79</i>" to stderr during execution of a BEGIN block, this will confuse my parser.
</ul>
Now I have to design an API for it.
Basically I can trigger any callback on shifts, reduces and reads. Those sets of callbacks are conveniently packaged as, well, packages. So I was thinking about something like
<ul><li>a <code>Perl::ShadowParser</code> that implements the parser
<li><code>Perl::ShadowParser::*</code> backend plugins that provides the callbacks
<li>a little program for your convenience that runs the parser on any script with any callback(s) you've provided :
<blockquote><code>perlshadowparser -b backend1 -b backend2=option1,option2 perlscript</code></blockquote>
</ul>
Lots of tests will be needed, too.
<p>If you have any ideas of something cool to do with it (ideas for backends...), I'm listening.</p>

...is to produce IMCC output so you can target Parrot.<br> <br>Not sure how well that would work yet, but cool none the less!<br> <br>

Another obvious backend is to produce Perl 6 code.
<p>There are many ways to implement a Perl 5 to Perl 6 translator. For example, a B module similar to B::Deparse could do a good job. But it won't work on all Perl 5 sources. (See the BUGS section in the B::Deparse manpage.)
Another way is to build a completely standalone Perl 5 parser. Very difficult (it's a task for Damians). A third solution is to put a hook into Perl 5.10's parser. The fourth solution is my Evil Hack. Of course, those solutions are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>I think that producting a working Perl52Perl6 converter is very important. We'll see what Hugo has to say about it.</p>
