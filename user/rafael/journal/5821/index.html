<div class="span8">
<p>The continuing Stas / Nick discussion previously mentioned here should lead to
an improvement of the perliol manpage.
<p>
Bu the main headline is that we had a long, heated discussion about ithreads,
and how should one write a module that runs OK with a non-threaded
perl, but at the same time is thread-friendly in an threaded
environment.
<p>
Knowing that a pure-perl module is by default threadsafe, unless
it relies on some external state, the problem was : how to detect
that we run under a threaded perl, and if not, disable the
thread-specific calls ? (Currently, use()'ing <tt>threads</tt> in a
non-threaded perl emits a compile-time fatal error.)
<p>
Loading <tt>Config.pm</tt> is probably
a bit overkill (esp. in mod_perl environments, as Elizabeth Mattijsen
pointed out.) Nick Ing-Simmons suggested a new builtin ${^ITHREADS}
(and I provided a patch for that). Sarathy quickly had the idea
of a more generic bit-field variable ${^BUILD_OPTIONS} ; while Jarkko noticing
<i>"the lid of the worm can is flying in the air"</i>, Nicholas
Clark put this idea to a new level, a special hash %{^BUILD_OPTIONS}.
I have to quote Jarkko's reply :
<blockquote><i>
I hereby suggest immediately forming a committee and at least three
subcommittees to discuss which subset of %Config needs to be in the
$^BUILDOPTIONS or %^BUILDOPTIONS or %^Config, since while some people
might be happy with just, say, the $Config{use*}, some other people
might want $Config{*size}, or $Config{*dir*}, or $Config{d_fork}, or
$Config{extensions}, or ...
</i></blockquote>
Well. After having considered postponing RC2, Jarkko decided that this issue
was not so important, especially with so little feedback from real module
authors who write real-world thread-friendly code. So, when Arthur Bergman,
the ithreads designer, returns from vacation, he'll decide if something has
to be done for RC3.</p>
