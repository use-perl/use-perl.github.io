<p>Pablo, my older son (who is five year old now) was going last year to a gym
club for little children. And we were not statisfied by this club, named <i>The
Little Gym</i>, apparently a spin-off of a North-American group. (We tried it
because it was located in Lyon Vaise, a few dozen meters away from our home.)
My son had swimming lessons ; his professor changed every month or so, and the
date and time of his class even more often. So much for the pedagogical
relationship with the teacher (esp. knowing that my son has the same problems
with socializing than his geekish father.) Moreover the classes were rather
expensive, compared to others. Well, to summarize it, we wanted to end the
contract -- if we didn't notify the club's manager, the contract was tacitly
renewed.<p>So my wife went to the club and just said that -- very politely,
without anger, explaining what we didn't like and why we were leaving. And what did happen ? The club's manager and owner went mad and
did insult her, in front of my son and other parents, calling her an hysterical
shit-covered teenager (<i>merdeuse hyst&eacute;rique</i>), threatening to call
the cops (for a reason that remains completely obscure), and last but not
least, violently insulting my own son -- <i>who was present</i> --, calling him
a worthless and socially inadapted kid, in two words a congenital idiot, and
that he wanted no clients like us anyway. <p>Fucking shit. Who's that guy ? A
nostalgic of the Hitlerjugend ? His business is too good for us ? And why are
people like this are allowed to work with little children anyway ? Someone is going to
have <i>very</i> negative publicity. He doesn't know which kind of relations
has my wife.
