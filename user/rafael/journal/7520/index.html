Apparently Simon is willing to turn himself into one of those fellows that criticize other people's code without ever producing a fix. Or do I understand correctly ? Oh, and I guess that Arthur Bergman has to take over Simon's CPAN modules for which ownership hasn't been transferred yet.

No.

If you had comments on your blog we wouldn't have to talk about you here. Would that make you happier?

I wish people would stop baiting Simon constantly.<br> <p>It seems that Simon called someone else an insulting name.  I don't know the circumstances and I don't want to know.  Maybe it would be better if someone apologized to someone else, maybe they already have or they have in their own way and nobody was listening.  Maybe there will be no apology and we'll just have to suck it up.<br> </p><p>If people were <i>really</i> concerned about the community rather than their own bruised feelings, they would just drop it.  Sometimes, you have to sacrifice for the sake of a community.  If that means turning the other cheek and not constantly stirring the pot by reliving the past, then that might be what's necessary.<br> </p><p>From where I stand, Simon is a valuable member of the community as are the others who are involved in this brouhaha.  Let's not allow this conflict of personalities to fracture the community any more.</p>

OK, some more clarification about my journal entry. I wasn't baiting Simon -- I wanted to point out that his blog statement I was quoting, whether it's true or false, really sounds like an overemphasized drunkard's oath. I really don't care whether someone insulted and/or felt insulted by someone else. The most valuable contribution one can make to the community is code, and help about code, and on this point, Simon has always been very helpful, both publicly and privately with me. And for the comments-on-the-blog thing, Simon just decides what he wants to put on his site or not.
