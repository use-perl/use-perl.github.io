<div class="span8">
<p>I like large books. A huge, heavy book is always more appealing to me than a short 150 page opus. Almost all non-tech books I've read from cover to cover over the past few years are at least 800 page long : for example,
<ul>
<li>The Mahabharata (the largest book in mankind's history -- as there is no complete french translation, I've only read a 2000 page "abstract")
<li>Asimov's complete robots / foundation cycle
<li>Saint Augustine's <i>City of God</i>
<li>James Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>
<li>Dum&eacute;zil's <i>Mythe et &eacute;pop&eacute;e</i>
<li>Hofstadter's <i>G&ouml;del Escher Bach</i>
</ul>
On the to-read list :
<ul>
<li><i><a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/">ANKOS</a></i>
<li><i>The Lord of the Rings</I>
<li><a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Powell,+Michael">Michael Powell</a>'s autobiography
</ul>
Downside : I need robust shelves.</p>

<h2>Wondering</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/darobin/">darobin</a> on 2002-05-24T12:41:46</h3>
<p>
  I've been wondering about Hofstadter's <em>G&#246;del Escher Bach</em> for a while, would you recommend it? Any specific comments?
</p>

Yes ! but it requires some amount of concentration. Otherwise you'll get lost. Worth a read anyway. One of the few books that makes you think you're actually intelligent. (Moreover, it benefits from an excellent french translation / adaptation. I think that Hofstadter did review it himself.)



<h2>GÃÂ¶del Escher Bach</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/robin/">robin</a> on 2002-05-24T15:55:02</h3>
GEB is a wonderful book! I wouldn't try and read it in one go though. The explanation of G&#246;del's theorem is pretty good, but if you want to understand it properly you'll need to read the relevant sections carefully and repeatedly. What is <i>really</i> wonderful about it is the exuberance and playfulness. Hofstadter uses punning multiply self-referential dialogues to simultaneously explain and illustrate various points about self reference (and anything else that happened to strike him as interesting and tangentially relevant).<p>
Talking of big books, I've just ordered Wolfram's <a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/" title="wolframscience.com">magnum opus</a wolframscience.com>. I saw it described as <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/user/shalizi/notebooks/cellular-automata.html" title="santafe.edu">a rare blend of monster raving egomania and utter batshit insanity</a santafe.edu>, which sounds irresistible.</p>

I've been reading it on and off for a few months now, but it is *very* heavy going. The worse thing I is that I studied some of the subjects at university level only a couple of years back and I'm finding them hard to grasp again. I've only "got" about 40% of the book so far and that has been worthwhile<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>On the other hand...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/torin/">torin</a> on 2002-06-18T16:47:59</h3>
Hmm.  I'm the opposite.  Large books are actually a bit of a negative for me.  I have been heard to call it shovelfiction.  I've been resisting reading George R.R. Martin's <a href="http://www.georgerrmartin.com/" title="georgerrmartin.com">A Song of Ice and Fire</a georgerrmartin.com> for a while because each of the books are near 1000 pages.  It was quite good and there wasn't slack in the ~2800 pages.<br> <br>I don't mind if something long is composed of multiple small books such as the Foundation series though.<br> <br>I guess part of my problem comes from the bulk of such a book - my arms get tired.  The other part comes from attempting to read some authors that just don't know how to edit their work; a recent example being Robert Jordan.
