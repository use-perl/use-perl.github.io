<p>I've just finished to read <i>The Dracula Archives</i>, by Raymond Rudorff.
That's a prequel to Bram Stoker's masterpiece, written in the very style of
the original (diary excerpts, newspapers, letters). This books is aimed at
explaining how the Dracula we see in the eponymous book came to be. It has
also close themes : the quest for eternal love and eternal life, and the horror that is the price for it.
<p>Now reading : <i>Anno Dracula</i> by Kim Newman. Very different, less
interesting probably. The first chapter comes from the journal of the Dr
Seward, who mumbles about an old man named Van Helsing, and then explains
how he killed a vampire named Annie Chapman. Next, we see another vampire, who
works for Scotland Yard, (his name is Lestrade),
investigating on murders occuring in Whitechapel... If you haven't recognized
every name I just quoted, then this isn't probably a book for you.

<p>Annie Chapman was a vampire! Now that's a theory I haven't heard before<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

And Lestrade, too (although he was turned into a vampire apparently <i>after</i> his friend Holmes was sent into a concentration camp -- the new husband of Victoria, some count from Transylvania, is ruling the country, and apparently he's not a funny guy). Abberline is still human however. And one of the experts in post-mortem medicine is the famous doctor Jekyll... and there's the Diogenes Club... and Fu Manchu... and, and... (Philip Jose Farmer was very good at this kind of books.)
