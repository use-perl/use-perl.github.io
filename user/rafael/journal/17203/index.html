P5P summary. (Which I didn't published this week, not out of laziness or
something, but because very few things actually happened on P5P, besides

<h2>sub mylc { lc }</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Juerd/">Juerd</a> on 2004-02-04T12:10:43</h3>
Is there any way to get the caller's $_, like with Perl 6 $CALLER::_?

Do you mean the caller's lexical $_, if it has one ?
<p>Well, lexical $_ is no different from other lexical variables. So I imagine <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/robin/PadWalker-0.10/PadWalker.pm" title="cpan.org">PadWalker</a cpan.org> will work with it.
</p><p>If you write:
<br>my $_; sub mylc { lc }
then the lc will act on the lexical $_. (I.e. you'll have a closure.)</p>

So the gap between built-ins and user defined functions gets even larger than it already is. With no clean way to access the caller's lexical $_ (PadWalker's nice, but not something I'd like to use on a regular basis) and built-ins that do work on that lexical $_, creating functions that work like built-ins gets hard.<br> <br>Closures aren't good enough, because you can't import them and many people do like to have utility functions in modules.<br> <br>The lexical $_ sounded like a good idea, but having a special variable that isn't really special is a bit weird, a bit like when you have a lexical $a or $b when sorting.<br> <br>Perl 6 fixes this with the pseudo namespace CALLER::, which is the caller's MY::, the pseudo namespace for lexicals.

A few points:
<p>
"my $_" is an addition, not a replacement. It's 100% backwards-compatible.
</p><p>
You can import closures, as long as they're not anonymous. But by doing so you "import" their lexicals as well.
</p><p>What you want is (as I understand it) to define a function that defaults to $_, as in :
</p><p>sub f(;$){my $arg = @_ ? $_[0] : $CALLER::_;...}
</p><p>This is unrelated to the ability of my'ing $_, which is introduced to solve side-effect and scoping problems, as well as problems with "local $_" versus magic. May I point you a P5P for in-depth discussion of this...</p><p>Note:
if you want to access the global $_, you can
always write $::_ or (now) "our $_" (or simply $_ if there's no lexical $_ in scope.)</p>

If I read p5p correctly, "lc" will still operate on the current $_, even if it is lexical.<br> <br>But my contrived "mylc" would no longer work as with a global $_.<blockquote><div> <tt>sub mylc { lc }<br>
&nbsp; <br>our $_ = "FOO";<br>print lc;&nbsp; &nbsp; # foo<br>print mylc;&nbsp; # foo<br>
&nbsp; <br>my $_ = "FOO";<br>print lc;&nbsp; &nbsp; # foo<br>print mylc;&nbsp; # FOO</tt> </div></blockquote>The point of having a default variable is not having to type it! But you now have to pass it to "mylc" explicitly if it is lexical.<br> <br>I understand that you want a lexical variable because you don't want other subs to mess with it. This action at a distance is unwanted and causes bugs. However, the action at a distance where $_ is used when no arguments are given, is a very useful tool. Larry realized that and invented $CALLER::_ for Perl 6.<br> <br>I hope something like that (not requiring modules like PadWalker) will be in the Perl 5 that has lexical $_ support, or I fear it won't be as useful as the current $_. (After all, "local *_" fixes the magic stuff.)

<i>But my contrived "mylc" would no longer work as with a global $_.</i> No, it will indeed. Just try it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Look:<p>$ bleadperl -le 'sub f{print}$_=1;my$_=2;f'
<br>1
</p><p>Here f()'s body is not in a scope where a lexical $_ is defined. Hence it will not use it. Really the difference between $_ and my $_ is the same than the difference between $x and my $x. You don't need to learn new things. And this new feature doesn't make you loose anything.</p>

Thank you for explaining how lexicals work. I am aware of scoping in Perl.<br> <br>All I'm asking for is a cheat to get the $_ in the caller's lexical scope.<br> <br>I am assuming that <code>my $_ = 3; print;</code> will actually output 3. Builtins often use $_ as the default value if no argument is given. My own utility functions also do that. I'd like to use lexical $_, but I'd also like to keep using utility functions the way I'm using builtins. Without scary stuff like PadWalker.<br> <br>I'm not familiar with perl's guts, but is it hard to have Perl 6's pseudo-namespace CALLER:: in Perl 5? If it is, is it also hard to have just $CALLER::_?<br> <br>$_ is the default variable. A lexical $_ that cannot act as the default variable would be very, very unperlish.<br> <br>Because then you'd end up typing <code>mylc($_)</code> instead of simply <code>mylc</code>. And if you have to supply it yourself, what use is having a default variable?<br> <br>But I think I'm not getting my point across. Maybe you're too excited about the change that you don't see my point, or maybe I'm just not clear enough.<br> <br>Or maybe I'm the only one who thinks $_ should be and stay the default variable.

<i>Maybe you're too excited about the change that you don't see my point</i><nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Thanks for your patience!<p>CALLER:: is feasible, I think it won't be difficult. So, assuming it gets implemented, the idiom to get the current default variable would be :
</p><p>
my $arg = exists $CALLER::{_} ? $CALLER::_ : $_;
</p><p>
This has the advantage of being valid in perl 5.8 and below. Assuming none of your modules is called CALLER.pm !
</p><p>You're most welcome to post your thoughts to P5P. You definitively have a point about CALLER an d I'd like to see it discussed.</p>
