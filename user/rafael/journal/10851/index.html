<div class="span8">
<p>Due to a combination of circumstances, my amount of free time is
becoming less copious. As a consequence, I decided to stop writing the
P5P summaries : because I can't guarantee anymore the amount of free
time necessary each week to read and summarize the whole P5P traffic in
time.
<p>
Of course, anyone is welcome to continue that summarizing work, with
or without my help. I still believe that those summaries are useful,
and I enjoyed writing them. 
<p>
On the other hand, I expect to be able to spend more time on code,
something I wasn't regularly doing recently. Moreover, when I'll notice
anything amusing or important on P5P, I'll report it here, so my journal could become a low-fat,
non-exhaustive version of the summaries, randomly mixed with my own
musings.

<h2>Thanks for all the fish</h2>

<p>So much mail, so much time and energy, so much exposure, too little thanks.  I hope Perl 5 is able to find as good a replacement as Perl 6 found in Piers, for you've done a tremendous job.</p>



<h2>But but...</h2>

They'll be missed, I enjoyed them.<br> <br>I hereby nominate [chaoticset] for the position<br>of Chief List Compactor<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)



<h2>Thank-you.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Damian/">Damian</a> on 2003-03-02T21:33:49</h3>
I will greatly miss them too. I had to stop following P5P about a year ago (because Perl 6 now takes up about 200% of my mailing-list tracking capacity<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-) and -- apart for annoying Jarkko and Hugo directly -- your summaries were my only way of keeping in touch with Perl 5 issues. They were brilliantly done and in themselves were a major contribution to Perl development. So thank-you for all your work, Rafael. It was greatly appreciated.

*I* was depending on Rafael's excellent summaries for keeping up with p5p (as I no more subscribe to it directly).

<h2>Appreciated</h2>

It was indeed greatly appreciated; thanks.



<h2>Thanks a lot</h2>

<p>I tried once or twice to subscribe to P5P,
but I could not keep up with the volume and
the level of knowledge needed to understand
the whole thing.</p>
<p>Thanks for for helping me follow at least
the most important stuff going on there.</p>



<h2>Thank you!</h2>

<p>The summaries allow people like me to pull themselves into the community.  I really appreciated it!</p>
