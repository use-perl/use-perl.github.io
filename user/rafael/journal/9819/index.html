<p>It's now time to continue this journal, interrupted during my vacation, and
after that mostly because I was ill. Well, I'm still ill, but I feel better
now, thanks. I got a nasty cold : the temperature here actually reached the
absolute zero (Celsiusly speaking, of course), something I don't think I'll
ever become familiar with. (In the most inner circles of Dante's
<i>Inferno</i>, as well in the classical muslim Hell, sinners don't burn, they
are frozen. Is it because Dante and Muhammad lived in warm countries ? Anyway,
I find that a hell full of snow and ice is quite more frightening than a hell
full of fires and flames.) <p>And now for some link review. Tony Bowden
apparently <a
href="http://www.tmtm.com/nothing/archives/2003_01_07.html#000476">quotes</a>
a part of my unpublished autobigraphy : <blockquote><i>When I was at
university, I would often spend days just working through all the man
pages for something, testing all the different options, deciding which
I liked best, and setting up my configuration
accordingly.</i></blockquote> <p>Also found some <a
href="http://muppetlabs.com/user/breadbox/txt/infirni-notes.html">notes on
writing a monovocalic sonnet</a>, something that may entertain my readers,
esp. if you're already familiar with the writers of the <i>OuLiPo</I> (Georges
Perec, Raymond Queneau, Italo Calvino, Harry Matthews...) Note that this guy
helps his prosodic skills with Perl. Also, the sonnet he produced is a
short version of Dante's <i>Inferno</i>, which I'm managing to quote twice in
the same journal entry : kind of a personal victory.<p><i>Title of this journal entry by Thelonious Monk.</i></p>

<i>I got a nasty cold : the temperature here actually reached the absolute zero (Celsiusly speaking, of course), something I don't think I'll ever become familiar with.</i> <br> <br>Oh, the Frenchs are so touchy!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>Not speaking about your cold of course...that periodically happens to me as well (usually at higher temperatures, oddly enough). Hope you get well soon!<br> <br>During the past two weeks here in Germany we had temperatures at about -15&#176;C during the night. Last night temperatures of about -20&#176;C have been reported from around Munich. During the day they hardly rise over -5&#176;C.<br> <br>This should put things into perspective. France is rather spoiled when it comes to climate. I remember three weeks I spent in Paris some years ago (around Eastern). I was able to wear short-armed shirts most of the time! Note that you usually go skiing in Bavaria at this time of the year.

I'm probably more <i>touchy</i> than most Frenchs<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>;-)</tt> I'm born in a part of France where there is snow one day every ten years. The temperatures in Nice are currently around 10&deg;C. And my mother thinks it's cold (on the other hand, she's born in Africa.)
