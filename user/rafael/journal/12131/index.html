<p>While reading <a
href="http://www.apacheweek.com/features/vendorversions">this</a>, I had
one of those silly ideas, that I don't know if anybody could find it useful or
even interesting : build an on-line database of the perls shipped by various OS
vendors. More precisely, archive the outputs of <tt>perl -V</tt> and <tt>perl
'-V:.*'</tt>, the packaging method if applicable (RPM, RTE...), date of
release, vendor patches, set of standard modules that are distributed
separately from the core package, set of additional modules that may be
included...
</p>

<h2>Perlmonks...?</h2>

<p>I've seen a node recently on <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/" title="perlmonks.org">Perlmonks</a perlmonks.org> trying to establish the same core data, is this any help <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=249941" title="perlmonks.org">distributions and perl</a perlmonks.org>?</p>

Well, what I had in mind is supposed to include much more data. For example, RedHat 9 comes with an <i>heavily modified</i> 5.8.0. And compilation options : what distros provide large file support, or 64bit-ness, or threads, since when, etc.

<p>I didn't think it would be enough detail, but it may be a start. As you'll see it seemed a popular enough as a concept, and I think a lot of people would lke it done - some may even help.

</p><p>Are you thinking of building a module, similar to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/RCLAMP/Module-CoreList-1.9/" title="cpan.org">Module::Core</a cpan.org>, so it's available to Perl module developers, as well as in a on line form?</p>

<p>I think you are right in thinking that it would be a very useful resource for everyone. You could also include details on other binary distribution formats such as the various ActiveState builds for example.</p>

<p>I suppose you could build a simple Perl script that queried the installed Perl, and sent it's details back, along with it's OS details, and any user comments, similar to the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?cpantest" title="cpan.org">cpantest</a cpan.org> script?</p>
