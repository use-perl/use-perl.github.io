<p>Even if you're not, like me, a fan of (the early) Peter Greenaway's movies,
you'll be impressed by the heterogenous <a
href="http://us.imdb.com/Credits?0307596">cast</a> the IMDB lists for his
upcoming movie, <i>The Tulse Luper Suitcases</i>. Victoria Abril,
Kathy Bates (of <i>Misery</i> fame), Madonna, Don Johnson (from <i>Miami Vice</i> !), Rossy
de Palma, Isabella Rossellini, Sting... wondering if it's not a fake cast. (When I say <i>early</i> movies,
this includes of course his previous movies where the mysterious Tulse
Luper was alluded to : <i>Vertical Features Remake</i>, <i>A Walk Through H</i>,
and <i>The Falls</i>.)</p>

When I saw <i>The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover</i> I felt physically ill and wished I'd never watched.<br> <br>A few years later I rented <i>The Pillow Book</i>.  Fortunately, I didn't realize that these two had the same director, because <i>The Pillow Book</i> is one of my favorite films of all time.<br> <br>I went and saw <i>8 1/2 Women</i> and thought it was okay, but not too amazing.  I couldn't finished watching <i>A Zed and Two Noughts</i>, but I did like <i>The Draughtman's Contract</i> quite well.<br> <br>In other words, Peter Greenaway is quite a mixed bag for me.  I haven't seen any of these early films you mentioned, though.  I'll be curious to see this next one, though, and the cast is definitely intriguing.

My favorites would be : 1. <i> <a href="http://petergreenaway.co.uk/falls.htm" title="petergreenaway.co.uk">The Falls</a petergreenaway.co.uk> </i> (very strange, doesn't look like any other movie I've ever seen, and very fascinating -- a collage of documentaries about a supposed conspiration of birds, provoking a violent mutation on some humans), 2. <i>Prospero's Books</i> (adapted from Shakespeare's <i>Tempest</i>), and 3. <i>Drowning by Numbers</i>. For the rest I share pretty much your impressions (except that I haven't seen <i>A Zed and Two Noughts</i>, and I didn't get ill while watching <i>The Cook...</i>).
