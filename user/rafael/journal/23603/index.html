<p>OK, it's been a long time since I've not ranted. But they did it again. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=worldNews&storyID=7876469">More
nonsense from Christian wackos</a>; this time, in Paris. You'd bet we would
have been safer here, but no. So, here's the story -- an ad poster copies the layout of one of the
most famous (and imited) paintings of all time, Leonardo da Vinci's <i>Last
Supper</i>, and an association of right-wing fundamentalists called (by
antiphrasis) "Beliefs and Freedoms" complains about it. So far, this is not
really surprising. Fanatics are usually unable to make a difference between
form (in this case, homage to a well-known work of art) and message (the
supposed blasphemy, in practice just an ad for over-expensive, ugly clothes).
What's more surprising is that a judge finds they're right and bans the said
<a href="http://fr.news.yahoo.com/050310/202/4b8ps.html">poster</a>. Judges and
other officials of the Republic are not supposed to be biased in favor of
religions.<p />So what's next? If harmless pictures are censored, what about
<a href="http://www.mat.upm.es/user/jcm/michelangelo.html">actually offensive
material</a>?</p>

I don't think there's anything wacky about complaining when someone, to your eyes, defiles a symbol you hold dear.  It's called free speech.  Let them complain, and if enough people agree, then the company will pull it.  Good for anyone who can accomplish the goal, if they feel strongly enough about it.  I don't see this as significantly different from the boycott of Amazon over the patent stuff.<br> <br>On the other hand, I see no justification for the law getting involved.  That's crazy to me.<br>

I'm not complaining about fundamentalists whining. I'm complaining about jugdes listening to them. This is futile. This ad is not even trying to lie about the product it sells, which would be a good reason to ban it.
