<p>When I read <i>Under the Volcano</i> recently (very good book by the way), I was impressed by the number of french quotes or sentences in there; and by the fact that most of them were grammatically incorrect. The most common error seems to be caused by the gender of the nouns. That's understandable, as english uses the neutral gender for most objects, whereas french doesn't have a neutral gender. But today, I was browsing through <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i>, recently purchased, that I plan to read soon, and funnily, I noticed exacly the same error : the title of the second part is <i>Un Perm' au Casino Hermann Goering</i>, while in the french translation it has become the more correct <i>Une Perm' au Casino Hermann Goering</i>. (The writers of those books both were sailors and did go to France while they were in the army.)</p>

If you want to see butchered French spelling, read <cite>Necronomicon</cite>.

<p>And that is the only conceivable reason you'd ever want to read
<cite>Necronomicon</cite>.</p>

Heh, ever heard speaking a Dutch German?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>I am not acquainted with Dutch myself: in German we have three genders (masculin, feminine and neutrum). The Dutchs regularly get them all wrong: And I mean all. Either they have just one gender (as the Anglophones) or they also have several genders but each Dutch noun has a different gender than its German counterpart.<br> <br>As a side node: We have some very succesful Dutch showmasters in the German TV. Some people say that they are only succesful because of their sometimes comical gender-permutations. Some even say they are forced to use wrong genders at least in XX% of all cases...it would be in their contracts.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
