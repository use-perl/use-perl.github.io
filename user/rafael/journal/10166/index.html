<p><blockquote><i>We have a (generally sensible) pro-property bias in this culture that makes it extremely hard for people to think critically about the most complicated form of property out there Ã¢â¬â what most call Ã¢â¬Åintellectual property.Ã¢â¬Â To question property of any form makes you a communist. Yet this is precisely our problem: To make it clear that we are pro-copyright without being extremists either way.</i> --

Every month, I read <i>Jazz Magazine</i>,
the best french source for jazz news. It
comes with a free CD, that contains
public-domain works. Usually, these are
rarities : tunes that were never published
in digital form. The authors of these
compilations are knowledgeable, thus there
are often little treasures in there : for example,
recordings of the ephemeral Tadd Dameron / Miles Davis quartet, or the first recorded version
of <i>Night in Tunisia</i>, before that tune
found its name (it used to be called
<i>Interlude</i>.) They're free, they're
previously unavaible, the quality of the recordings is often poor, thus no company
has interest in releasing them. But they're
important.<p>
The history of Jazz has quite a few things
to teach to us about intellectual property
and copyright issues, versus creation and progress. More on that later. --
