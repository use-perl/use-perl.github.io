<p>I'm investigating to install
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a>
 at work, for our projects. If anyone has already tried it, esp. on perl / mod_perl projects, esp. with mod_dav_svn (subversion over mod_dav), I'd be happy to know what you've done with it and how well it worked. (Side note -- I remember Hugo having said <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=200207301220.g6UCKtr07589%40crypt.compulink.co.uk">once</a> that it was possible to consider replacing Perforce by subversion to keep the bleadperl sources).</p>

<h2>Wait for 1.0</h2>

<p>I've been following subversion for a long while.  I still receive the announcements.  They are getting very close, but have not yet released a 1.0 version.  I think until subversion's own developers feel confident enough to call it 1.0, it will not be safe to use in production work.</p>

<p>I intend to start using it as soon as possible after 1.0 comes out, though.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

  At OSCon, Greg Stein said they were calling it alpha because it is VC software, otherwise it'd be a "late beta". That's not to say go ahead and use it on something critical, but apparently he was rather confident that it could be used in production, perhaps with overly eager back ups at first. SV has been self-hosting for over a year now, which is already very good.
</p>

<p>
  I'd love to hear about SV experiences too. I'll sure start using it soon.

<h2>So far, so good</h2>

I've been using it just to play with it on my laptop.  It seems really good so far but take this with a grain of salt because A) I'm using it by myself, no other users, and B) I'm not using the DAV bits.<br> <br>I have found at least a few bugs (or maybe just unhelpful error messages) but nothing critical, and bring able to rename things is pretty darn cool.

Are you using the Sleepycat backend?  It's been a while since I looked into it, but I seem to recall that's how they implement the non DAV bits.
</p>
<p>I'd really like to be able to use svn for my own, mostly single-user purposes.  Any pointers?

I think it's berkeleydb that it uses, but the URLs are just file:///path/to/repository<br> <br>I've had no trouble with it to speak of.  It's enough like cvs to be really easy to switch to, but  it's just better. If you've used CVS, you'll have no trouble with it.
