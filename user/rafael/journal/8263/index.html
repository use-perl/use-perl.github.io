I do!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<p>
In fact I've got a shiny new(ish) dual processor server in the mail which will be my new subversion server.
</p><p>
This will be availible for projects and things if anyone is interested.</p>

<p>I've had a long-standing interest, since before it was a year old.  You can even find some of my posts on the mailing list from way back there, when I thought I might play with it a bit.  I was reading actively around the time Chip came around.</p>

I'm interested in subversion at several levels.

<p>One is that it's an interesting take on an SCM, both in terms of features and in terms of depending on other large OSS projects (Apache2 and mod_dav),and a standard protocol (DAV) which is both a blessing and a curse.

</p><p>Another is that I'd like to see a svn backend for VCP.

</p><p>Another is that it's giving bk a run for its money in terms of publicity / interest in the OSS community even though it is coming from behind and is a fair amount less mature as yet.

</p><p>What's your interest?

My interest is twofold<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;- First, I'm already using subversion. And Hugo expressed interest in eventually moving the Perl 5 sources from p4 to subversion. This means to have a conversion tool, because we want to keep the history. No, threefold : I like subversion, both for its technology and for its power and ease of use. I expect it to be more and more used for OSS projects. And from what I know about the reactivity of the Perl community, I expect early adoption of subversion by it.

I'm keeping my eye on it.  I was motivated enough to try to install it a few weeks ago, but after wasting fifteen minutes trying to find an easy way to download and bootstrap the current version, I gave up.  I haven't had another fifteen minutes to try again.  I was going to suggest to Tom that we keep the Cookbook in subversion for the second edition, but that time has passed and we're now using CVS.<p>

Subversion is becoming more stable and snapshots are released regularly. It's not necessary to bootstrap a 'bleadsvn' if you don't want to keep in touch with the development. Moreover, you aren't any longer forced to pull apache2/apr from CVS. More on that later. But you're right, if you don't have 15 minutes from time to time to upgrade and configure svn until 1.0 is out, keep using something you know.

<p>
  I've been following svn mostly due to my interest in DAV. I posted once or twice about that to my journal ages ago.
