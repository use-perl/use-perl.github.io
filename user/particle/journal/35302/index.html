<h2>'usage' method not actually overridden?</h2>

Hi,

<p>Firstly, thanks very much for your last couple of diary entries, they've been helpful getting me started learning a bit more about parrot and PCT.</p>

<p>Looking at your second change though, I'm not sure that it's working the way that it's supposed to...</p>

<p>Does Perl6::Compiler actually sub-class HLLCompiler?  It doesn't appear to, since the 'usage' method that you define in perl6.pir never seems to be called.  It seems to be using the version defined in HLLCompiler instead, which presumably means that the one in perl6.pir is not overriding the other one.</p>

<p>Also, in any case I think that the method contains an error:  I'm not certain, but I think it should say 'if has_name goto has_name', and not 'unless has_name<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...' as it says at the moment?</p>

oops! you're right. there's no reason for a 'usage' method in perl6, because HLLCompiler already provides one. all i need to do is put the usage text in the '$usage' attribute. i've made this change in r24667.<br><br>view the diff here: <a href="http://perlsix.org/svn/parrot/revision/?rev=24667" title="perlsix.org">http://perlsix.org/svn/parrot/revision/?rev=24667</a perlsix.org>
