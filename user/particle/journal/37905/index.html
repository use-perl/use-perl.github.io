<p><p>Much of my volunteer time over the past few weeks has been devoted to the organization of Parrot Foundation's first Parrot Developer Summit, which took place this past weekend in Mountain View, CA. Our primary objective was to write a roadmap to the release of Parrot 1.0 and beyond. Secondary objectives included review and discussion on support and release policies, updates on parrot subsystems and milestones, review of Parrot Foundation topics, and knowledge transfer between attendees.</p>

<p>To achieve these goals, we brought together Parrot Foundation directors, core Parrot developers and high-level language designers to spent two days in conference. During the meetings we used a number of agile techniques, and achieved amazing results. You can find our vision outlined in <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/chromatic/journal/37889">chromatic's journal</a>, and further discussed in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/parrot-dev/browse_thread/thread/724c927c208a77b5">this parrot-dev mailing list thread</a>.</p>

<p>Notably, <a href="https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/ParrotRoadmap">a roadmap</a> for Parrot has been made available on the parrot.org wiki, which will be updated as work progresses. This roadmap is a detailed and organized description of tasks which must be completed to achieve our goals, and it serves as an excellent place to judge the Parrot team's progress against release milestones. This document is a first for Parrot, and I hope it shows the maturity of the project team, and our commitment to meeting our published milestones. It allows our contributors to focus on the tasks remaining, and is an invaluable communication tool for the community.</p>

<p>Without the sponsorship of our advisory board members, the facilites provided by Google, and the support of the Parrot Foundation membership, this summit would not have been possible. Thanks all for your contributions, enthusiasm, and support.</p>
