People wondering why there's a late entry today may want to look at this taken from <a href="http://www.demon.net/helpdesk/status/status2.shtml" title="demon.net">Demon's  Status Page</a demon.net>.  It's nice the way that no ISPs provide permalinks for their service outages, isn't it?

Ah - I wondered where it got to!
<br>
In relation to Math::BigInt - there is another way of tackling the issue of large numbers by using Inline::BC (a shameless plug) - basically the bc interpreter sucked into Perl.

Cheers.
