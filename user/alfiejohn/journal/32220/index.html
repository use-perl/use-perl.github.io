I finally launched earlier this week.
</p>
<p>
After 3 months of coming home from work, eating dinner in front of the computer and going to bed in the wee hours of the night, I was finally finished... my attempt at web 2.0 stardom was ready.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.freehouse.com.au">Freehouse.com.au</a> is a website where anyone can advertise Australian property online, and in the same vain as other Web 2.0 sites, all for free.
</p>
<p>
Leading up to the launch I was filled with all kinds of emotion. From excitement, eagerness and happiness through to lots and lots of frustration.
</p>
<p>
Towards near completion, I found my heart beating faster whenever I even thought of Freehouse finally being online. I was very excited, and couldn't wait to be online. Then finally that day came ...and I felt empty.
</p>
<p>
They say that the journey is more important than the destination. I didn't want to believe them.
</p>
<p>
As the next couple of days past, I watched my usage graphs like a hawk. Happy when it spiked, but sad when it was void. But when they flat-lined all together depression slowly sunk in.
</p>
<p>
People told me I was crazy wanting to start my own website. I think they'll think i'm even more crazy when I tell them I'm looking forward to my next adventure.
</p>
<p>
So if you're thinking about starting your own Web 2.0 website, don't hesitate! Just keep trying until you succeed. It's a tough ride, but then again so is the 9 to 5.
