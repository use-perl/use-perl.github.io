<p><p>
			I've always known I was going to be a programmer. Ever since I was
			in primary school and made <a
			href="http://www.callapple.org/apple2/magazines/aar/logo.html">the
			turtle move in Apple LOGO</a>, I knew that computers were my future.
		</p>
		<p>
			As I grew up, I spent most of my time trying to learn how to write
			programs. I tried a lot of languages; BASIC, Pascal, asm, C/C++,
			VB, through to the esoteric such as <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCBoard_Programming_Executable">
			PPE</a> and <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a>.
		<p>

			When I got to University I naturally took up Computer Science. I
			wasn't the type to hang out at the bars or go to toga parties. I
			had something cooler to do. Something even more exciting. I <a
			href="http://vig.prenhall.com/catalog/academic/product/0,1144,0131429388,00.html">read Tanenbaum</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once the whole web-take-two thing took off, I knew that this was my
			chance. I wanted a slice of the action. And with my background I
			thought that I had what it takes to strike it big.
		</p>
		<p>
			I started reading blogs by <a
			href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/">Guy</a>s who <a
			href="http://paulgraham.com/start.html">made it</a> big. I started
			listening to <a href="http://www.twit.tv/ITN">podcasts</a> during
			my work commute and even started jogging to catch up on any
			<a href="http://www.churchillclub.org/podcasts.jsp">insider
			tips</a>. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I had all bases covered; the low-level languages, the high-level
			languages and even the buzzwords.
		</p>
		<p>
			And so I started <a
			href="http://www.freehouse.com.au/">Freehouse</a>...
		</p>
		<p>
			However, having the best programming languages under you belt 
			doesn't matter and knowing the difference between Splay tree 
			and a red-black tree isn't going to help you become the next 
			YouTube.
		</p>

		<p>
			Yep. I thought it was going to be straight forward. Almost
			automatic! But I missed out on something very important they 
			never taught us in school:
		</p>	
		<p style="margin-left: 2em;">
			Marketing.

Why do you think Rails is doing so well?



<h2>Marketing</h2>

<h2>It does help...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2007-01-25T22:52:42</h3>
but you need marketing too.<br><br>How do you think flickr scales up? It's not just one big database. This stuff involves compsci. Don't lose heart, but do try and find a marketing guy (or sales guy) who can help you get off the ground.



<h2>On marketing and business...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2007-01-26T01:45:11</h3>
At the OSCON 2005 Geeks in Business tutorial, I think there was one single point made that sums up the whole thing.<br><br>"Most successful IT startups begin with the same two people, Phone Guy and Supercoder"



<h2>Thanks for the reassurance</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/alfiejohn/">alfiejohn</a> on 2007-01-26T06:01:58</h3>
It seems that we all agree that marketing is very important in the success of a project.<br/><br/>Maybe sometime in the future i'll look into getting a phone guy, but for know it looks like i'll be putting my head back into the books<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
