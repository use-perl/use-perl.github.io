<p><blockquote>
			Hey. I too am starting a similar website such as yours, and am
			curious to know if there is any way we could help each other out.
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			Thanks, Andre. 
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			Ever since I read <a href="http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/writings/taoup/">The Art of Unix
			Programming</a>, I fell in love with the ideals of the hacker
			culture and the Open Source way.
		</p>

		<p>
			This book started me on a wild journey down the adverturous path of
			the GNU. It talked about the advantages of using "higher level
			languages" and that C/C++ wasn't always the answer. This prompted
			me towards learning Perl. As they say... the rest is history.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Perl programming language has taught me a lot. Not just about
			the way I code, but about community. Perl has this great thing
			called <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">the CPAN (Comprehensive
			Perl Archive Network)</a> that is totally community driven which
			no other language can even compete with, not even Python and PHP
			combined.
		</p>
		<p>
			So when I read the email above I was at first apprehensive. But
			then it came to me. Instead of just helping Andrew, why not help
			the community out there who might be learning how to use Perl to
			build their website or just dipping their feet at Web 2.0.
		</p>

		<p>
			That's why i've decided to release <a href="http://www.freehouse.com.au/blog/source.tar.gz">the entire source code to
			Freehouse.com.au</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Just be nice (this means you <a href="http://popcorn.cx/">Stephen</a> :). It wasn't made for public consumption so there is no
			documentation or comments. Althought I did try to make it as
			maintainable as possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			Technologies:
		</p>

		<ul style="margin-left: 2em;">
			<li>Perl</li>
			<li>HTML::Mason</li>
			<li>Class::DBI</li>
		</ul>	
		<p>
			Feel free to give me some feedback.  If you send me a patch, I might
			even include it into the site :) </p>

OK, I'll bite.<br><br>Why did you use Class::DBI, and not Rose?<br><br>Yes, I know everything is - or ought to be - a learning exercise, but even so.....

Hey Ron!<br><br>&gt; Why did you use Class::DBI, and not Rose?<br><br>Simply because that was what I was used to at the time and I was taking the path of least effort.<br><br>I haven't had a chance to look at Rose or DBIx::Class although regardless of past Class::DBI politics, I think it fits what I want to do quite nicely.<br><br>In particular, all I want is:<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * Get/set attributes for mapped objects<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * Search/retrieve<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * The ability to do complex SQL with ease<br><br>And now that I've worked on a couple of projects using Class::DBI, I can bend it into all different kinds of shapes.<br><br>PS: Since you left, Queen/Night pawn is now affectionately called the 'Ron Pawn'<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
