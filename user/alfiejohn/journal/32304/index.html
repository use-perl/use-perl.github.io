			Over at my <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/alfiejohn/journal">use.perl
			journal</a> where I duplicate this blog, <a
			href="http://use.perl.org/user/clscott/">clscott</a> left a really
			intriguing one-worded, hyperlinked comment -
			<a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/?biz">'Marketing'</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Taking the bait, I jumped on the link and landed at <a
			href="http://joelonsoftware.com/">Joel on Software</a>.  However it
			wasn't the entertaining posts that I was accustomed to by Joel on
			Software. It wasn't even Joel at all. It was a discussion forum
			with people talking about the art of <a
				href="http://www.ericsink.com/bos/Micro_ISV.html">microISVs</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			microISVs are vendors where the project management, marketing,
			sales, coding, support and coffee is done by a single person. When
			reading this, I subconsciously paraphrased Homer Simpson. "they were 
			guys like me. Guys like me? I'm a guy like me".
		</p>
		<p>
			After lurking for a couple of hours and going through the archives
			I decided the test the waters. <a
			href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz.5.444028.19">

			First post</a>. Having been bitten on Usenet, <a
			href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> and <a
			href="http://www.digg.com/">Digg</a>, I really didn't get my hopes
			up for a response.
		</p>
		<p>
			What a surprise. Instead of hazing, condesendence or annoying flash
			ads, I got positive feedback, suggestions, links to gurus and even
			a request to be interviewed!
		</p>
		<p>
			I would suggest that if your in the same boat and paddling up the
			proverbial stream, head over to <a
			href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/?biz">BoS</a> and feel
			the love.

<h2>Business of Software</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/scot/">scot</a> on 2007-02-02T16:26:53</h3>
Thanks for the pointer to the BoS Site++!



<h2>Thnx for the reminder!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/renodino/">renodino</a> on 2007-02-02T19:42:34</h3>
I had seen that site some months ago...but us uISVs
have scarce little time for pouring over all those discussions, and I forgot about it. Your post reminded me of that "To Do" item, and now I've picked up a couple of the recommended books.<p>

if only I could find time to sift thru all those discussions...&lt;sigh/&gt;</p>



<h2>Eric Sink's Book</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jonasbn/">jonasbn</a> on 2007-02-10T16:02:14</h3>
I have heard about the forum, but never really taken the time to use it or follow it.<br><br>But I can recommend <a href="http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=10068" title="apress.com">the book</a apress.com> by Eric Sink, which has it's foundation in his articles from MSDN.<br><br>I gave a talk on starting your own microISV at YAPC::Europe in Birmingham and I am still in the process myself - if you want the slides I can make them available to you - and I actually think I have an article somewhere aswell.<br><br>I am willing to share ideas and discuss things if you are interested.<br>
