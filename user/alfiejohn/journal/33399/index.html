You mean 31415962532718281828.html?  It just throws an error -- I thought the puzzle would be a JAPH or something.  What am I missing?

Looks like you were off by one

I get the same thing. I even tried rounding pi up (though it just says 'first 10 digits', not, e.g., 'accurate to 10 digits').

Yeah, me too. Independently.

I wrote a quick script to brute force all the combinations based on VSarkiss number being "off by one".  Every single one returns the same page as a 500 error. (not a 404 which indicates a problem with the server or a poor implementation)<br><br>I repeated using the correct numbers (pi containing 2653 instead of 6253) and got the same response.<br><br>So Alfie, what's the deal?  Hamish said that you admitted that you had rounded instead of truncated.<br><br>What kind of treasure hunt has clues and solutions that don't match?

ohh well... I was really bored one night and remembered Hamish telling me recently about a job advert he saw in a website's page source.
<br> <br>
So to play on that, I added a joke in my page source since I knew it would egg him on towards getting on with his skunkworks.
<br> <br>
If you're really bored, I found this:
<br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;http://www.pythonchallenge.com/
<br> <br>
Just pick up the challenges using Perl instead of Python<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
 <br>
Anyway the solution to the first one was something along the lines of:
<br> <br>
<br> <br>
#!/usr/bin/perl
<br> <br>
use strict;<br>
use warnings;
<br> <br>
# first 10 digits (after rounding)
<br>
my $pi = 3141592654;<br>
my $e  = 2718281828;
<br> <br>
my $filename = ( $pi + $e ) . '.html';<br>
print $filename, "\n";

Now I get a different response<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>I did actually try addition in case you were being ambiguous about the meaning of '+', but I didn't try it with the rounded values...

Finally... we have a winner<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
