<div class="span8">
<p><p>The REST stuff has had to go on the backburner for a while, because I wrote
down what needed to be done to start that, and it's a long list!</p>

<p>At <a href=""http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/network/">work</a> I've been setting
up a new PostgreSQL server, and migrating a few of our systems to use DB
schema, which has been interesting. For the uninitiated, a <em>schema</em> is
a layer between the table and the database that allows logical grouping of
tables. You can have one schema per app, say, and allow referential integrity
between schema, whereas before you wouldn't have been able to directly refer
to relations in another app's database.</p>

<p>I tend to avoid posting in journals when computers are giving me a hard
time, and boy, this past weekend, it was just like that! I decided to re-image
my <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/>MythTV</a> system, for two
ends: One was to change from RAID0 to RAID1, and the other was to upgrade
Linux distro from FC4 to Ubuntu Edgy.</p>

<p>To be honest, this stuff is always a PITA. Myth is the kind of app
that prefers to be run as a black box - once the thing's up and running just
don't ever touch it again, and you'll be fine. Try to fiddle here and there,
or update the odd package, and you'll be done for. So I should have expected
the worst with a massive change like this, you're right. My big problem is
that I have this great TV card called a <a
href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/PVR-350">Hauppauge PVR-350</a>. I
love it. It does MPEG2 encoding and decoding in hardware, and has the best
quality TV-out of any graphics card I've ever seen. Sadly the Linux drivers
are nowadays pretty much abandonware, and even the MythTV project has <a
href="http://www.mythpvr.com/mythtv/pvr-350-mythtv-support.html">dropped
official support</a>. I can agree with their reasons, whilst still being upset,
mind. I spent a frustrating day and a half pissing around with kernel modules
and parameters, rebooting, and generally turning the air blue, before calling
time on the card after three happy years.</p>

<p>Luckily for me, work had just upgraded my workstation graphics card and I
had an Nvidia Geforce4 MX4000 sitting in the drawer. It's passively cooled,
making it excellent for this application, and of course the binary drivers are
nice and stable. It also has the TV-out I need to replace the Hauppauge card.
I can report an immediate and noticeable loss in TV picture quality, but
digital terrestrial is good enough to reveal that I suppose. The picture is
just a little grainy, and washed out, but it's still leagues better than
analogue. Having said that, SWMBO tends not to notice when Myth chooses to
record from analogue rather than digital anyway, so we're hardly quality
snobs!</p>

<p>Apart from that headache, the system's running like a dream under Edgy, and
in fact I've implemented a few nice hacks that weren't in the old FC4 setup. I
also use that box as a general GNU/Linux hacking system, so the wonderful, and
beer-free, <a href="http://www.nomachine.com/">NX Server</a> got installed. I can
highly recommend it if you need remote desktop on a Linux box, but have (or
want) SSH as your only means of remote access. Being a Kerberos fanboy, the
system also gets setup to authenticate to the OX.AC.UK realm, so remote
access into work becomes straightforward.</p>

<p>One last thing before I sign off. I'm looking forward to the <a
href="http://london.pm.org/lpw/">London Perl Workshop</a> tomorrow. I didn't
manage to arrange to go in time for the last one, and it looks to be a nice
lineup this year. I'll also bump into some new friends from MiltonKeynes.pm,
and some old friends from London, I hope, making it a nice day out. See you
there, maybe!</p>
