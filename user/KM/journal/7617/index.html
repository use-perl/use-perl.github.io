<p>Ok, so I'm not exactly sure why or how this happened. We went to the pet store (PetSmart) yesterday to pick up some fish supplies, and a new brush for Zeke. Somehow, I ended up on the floor playing with some puppies. On the weekend, someone brings dogs to PetSmart for people to adopt (dogs that would otherwise be going to the pound). I'm not sure what happened next, but we were suddenly deciding if we wanted to get one. We went home, talked things over, and somehow ended up being back at the pet store, adopting a new puppy!
<P>
I have two photos of her online <a href="http://perlguy.com/images/jasmine/jasmine1.jpg">here</a> and <a href="http://perlguy.com/images/jasmine/jasmine2.jpg">here</a>. Obviously, we named her Jasmine. Kyla wanted to name her Flower, but we decided to name her after a flower (well, actually after a bush. We have a large one in our back yard). She is about 10 weeks old, by the way. She is some sort of hound dog mix, near as we can tell. My guess is that she is mainly Red Coonhound, but a vet may be able to tell us.
<P>
Bringing her home was fine. Zeke, our 50 lb. lab/shepard/rottie mix, was fine with her. But man, he was drooling more than a Catholic priest at a choir boy sleepover! Nasty! He sort of didn't know what to make of her, but he has been really good so far.
<P>
Tigger, our fat cat. Tigger was very good with her. Even came up a few times to touch noses. No hissing, no scratching (yet), and generally went about his business.
<P>
So, we are all pretty excited to have Jasmine as the new member of our family. I'll keep y'all posted on the goods, the bads, and the photos of her.</p>
