<p>I think 98% of anyone I meet.. from neighbors to barbers.. after asking me where I moved from say "Why would you move from Florida to here??" in a tone of "what are you nuts?" Sort of tired of saying over and over "It's too hot and flat there for me, I just don't like it", I decided to start posing the question back to them. I started with the lady cutting my hair. She asked, and I replied "Well, why don't you move to Florida?" She paused, then replied "Florida is nice to visit, but I like it up here." EXACTLY!<br/><br/>I think I'll just started saying I moved here from Buffalo when people ask where I moved from. </p>

Well, you could do what 98% of people do when you ask them why they preferred one thing over another:  "It sucks."
<blockquote><div>Them:  <em>Why did you move from Florida to here?!</em>
<p>You:  <strong>Florida sucks.</strong></p>
</div></blockquote>
That'll quiet the meager curiosity of most people.

Well, I'll maybe use that with some people, and be slightly more tactful with others (like new neighbors). I'll see what reactions I get.<br> <br>KM -- Human Trolling Expert

Well, did you move <i>from</i> Florida or <i>to</i> wherever-you-live-now?

I moved from FL after I hosted YAPC, to upstate NY.

<h2>the same old question</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gav/">gav</a> on 2003-07-30T18:16:34</h3>
Everybody always asks that becasue they're shocked that you would move to the area. I think it's a case of the grass-is-greener syndrome where everyone thinks where they live sucks (after a few years when the I've-just-moved-here-it's-great feeling wears off). Of course this means that if you plotted this trend as a curve it would prove that everywhere sucks. Or something.

Yup, I agree. The grass in FL is just as green, but much sharper and more crunchy<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) I know when I lived in CT I always liked it. I never took any of it for granted... maybe because I had lived in FL before (CT -&gt; FL -&gt; CT -&gt; FL -&gt; NY). I learned what I would miss when it was gone.<br> <br>On another note, I got to do a little hiking today. Felt GREAT to be out in the woods, and not sweating like a swine.
