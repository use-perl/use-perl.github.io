<p>I'm finally getting to work on something different at work. Generally, I have been working on a web-based email system, and g11n/i18n of applications. I enjoy the i18n stuff, and especially enjoyed doing it with email. I certainly have learned a lot about it. I can parse any email, from any charset, in any encoding and convert it all like nobodys business! At some point, I'd like to share what I know about this subject.
<p>
So, now I get to do some work with Kerberos. This should be interesting since I haven't yet had the opportunity to play with this. Hopefully, I will learn something :) Right now, I have two main tasks to work on. First, make a wrapper around some C libs we have which get a yea/nay on if someone is authenticated in the KDC. This means delving into XS, or Inline::C which I haven't done yet. And, making a daemon which uses SSL and XML-RPC as the transport and does modifications on the KDC... adding/removing principles and changing passwords. I've done daemons, XML-RPC servers and SSL stuff before, so that isn't a big deal... but playing with principle records will be fun.</p>
