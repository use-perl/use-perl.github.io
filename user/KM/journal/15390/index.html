<div class="span8">
<p>I've been pretty much MIA from the Perl community lately, not that <b>anyone</b> has noticed. Not sure why I've been away. I guess being unemployed has taken me out of the normal geek-loop. And, #perl... well, I take a break from #perl every so often anyways. I'm still active with TPF, but that's about it right now.
<p>
Anyways... if anyone cares you can still see what's been up with my life on my <a href="http://perlguy.com/">regular journal</a>. New house, new state, dead dog, wildlife, kid, etc... Mundane, but my life.</p>

It is not like I think every day "hey where's KM?," but when I do see you I think, "hey, haven't seen you, how you been?"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  But I have been largely "inactive" too, so just because I don't see someone doesn't mean they are not "around."  You gonna be at YAPC next year, right?  I am planning tentatively on coming.

At least someone sorta noticed!<br> <br>Been good, loving NY. I keep most things on my other journal about that (updates and such).<br> <br>Yes, I plan to be at YAPC since it is only a few hours drive from me. I'm helping the coordinators (advising, since I did it last year), and expect another good YAPC because they seem to be a good team of folks. So, unless I'm employed by then and my employer wouldn't let me go, I'll be there with bells on!
