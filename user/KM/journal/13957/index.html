<p>Tomorrow Kyla will turn 5. I sort of feel bad for her since her party will be lame. Since we are new here, she has no friends to party with. So, it will be family. My mom is coming up from FL, and of course my dad already lives here. I'll be baking her a cake in a little while.<br/><br/>5 years. Wow. Seems like only 4 years and 264 days ago when she was a little helpless thing which pooped at will. To date she has installed FreeBSD (I told her what to click, and she would), installs and plays games on her own, knows her way around various kid websites, talks, runs, can read, and does all sorts of things which amaze and amuse me.<br/><br/>She's a cool kid. I think I'll keep her :-)</p>

<h2>Not lame at all!</h2>

One of my best birthday parties when I was about that age was only my best friend and myself.  My parents had two huge cakes for us (one for each of us) and took us to the local <a href="http://www.tivoligardens.com/" title="tivoligardens.com">very pretty amusement park</a tivoligardens.com>.<br> <br>I don't know why I didn't have more people that year, but I think that's what I wanted.  It's the only birthday from ~20 years ago I have clear memories of.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>
