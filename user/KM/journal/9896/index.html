<p>Calling all non-US folks who have a digital camera!! My daughter has a school assignment (she's 4, is it considered an assignment?) called "Flat Stanley". Basically, Flat Stanley is a drawing of a kid, which she colored. Anyways, the thing is, she is supposed to get photos of Flat Stanley doing things in other countries. This is where you come in! I scanned in Flat Stanley <a href="http://perlguy.com/images/flat_stanley.jpg">right here</a>, so I'd like for people to print it out (preferably in color), grab their digital camera and take some photos of Flat Stanley doing things in your country. By the ocean, by some neat signs, at any famous or well-known location.. just have fun with it!
<P>
When you are done, just email the photos to <a href="mailto:flat-stanley@perlguy.com">flat-stanley (at) perlguy.com</a>, and please let me know where the photos were taken. I really appreciate this, and think it will be fun for you, and interesting for Kyla to see the photos. Thanks in advance!!
<P>
PS. Feel free to submit photos of Flat Stanley next to nude women, I just won't show those to Kyla ;-)</p>

That's fine by me! Like I said, I want people to have fun with it, as well as me, Kyla and her class in looking at them. But, I hope I don't get too many with Flat Stanley being impaled on the Eiffel Tower<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
