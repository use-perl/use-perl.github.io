<p>Seems there are no active PM groups up this way. A few weeks ago I emailed some contact which seemed like a HudsonValley.pm, but got no reply. I see no Albany.pm, or Saratoga.pm. <br/><br/>If you are a Perl hacker up this way, let me know. I already started one PM group (Hartford.pm) and helped revive another (SouthFlorida.pm), and don't feel like starting another one unless I know some folks are in the area. "In the area" for me is Albany to Lake George. I'm up for getting some lunch, doing a talk, hanging out.. anything!</p>

You should be able to find some kindred spirits at RPI in Troy.  I don't know if there's an actual Perl Monger group, but the ACM chapter was fairly active when I was there, and we always had some non-student members hanging around, so you might want to check them out.

Maybe I'll check that out. Someone I know goes to RPI, and when he gets back up here we'll get together. Maybe I'll meet some other geeks there. Thanks for the heads up.

There <i>are</i> Perlfolk in the capital region.  Clark Cooper used to live in Albany/Troy/Schenectady a few years ago.  Probably still does, but he's dropped off the map as far as Perl is concerned.  (If you do manage to find him, please say Hi from me.)
<p>
ISTR he mentioned there being a local Perl Mongers group, but this would be about 4 years ago.  Maybe it's time to kick it back in gear?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

Yeah, I know Clark. We are supposed to get together for lunch. I've been in contact, and will say hello.<br> <br>If I can find whomever is supposed to be running any local groups, I'll poke them with a stick and get 'em in gear<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
