<div class="span8">
<p>I have told my co-workers many times that using shift when getting args to a sub is what they should be doing:
<P>
<CODE>
sub foo {
    my $zog = shift;
    ....
}
</CODE>
<P>
instead of:
<P>
<CODE>
sub foo {
    my $zog = $_[0];
    ....
}
</CODE>
<P>
Because no one re-uses @_, and I don't think most understand how @_ really works. Do people listen? No. Well, some did when I explained how it copies data from @_ needlessly in their code. But, it is still used.
<P>
So, today I was debugging some taint errors being throws by a CPAN module, and tracked it down to an internal module. It calls an AUTOLOAD'd method on the CPAN module, which in turn uses @_. If @_ exists, the autoloaded method returns 1, otherwise 0. But, since @_ isn't altered in the calling method, it ALWAYS returns 1 (making it useless) and becomes taint-unsafe since the autoloading tries to eval on the value from @_.
<P>
So kids, when someone explains to you that one thing isn't as good as another, please listen! It could save time from fixing broken code in the future.</p>

<h2>Always use shift?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2002-11-19T20:51:53</h3>
<p> <em>Curiously, Ben Tilly mentioned that at least one company would <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=52735" title="perlmonks.org">ding you on a code review for using shift</a perlmonks.org>.</em>

</p><p>Don't you think that you've just found a special case?  Unless I misunderstood you, you would dislike the following:</p>

<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;my ($self,$user,$pass,$action) = @_;</tt>

<p>For the that example, it seems clearer to use <tt>@_</tt> rather than shift four times.  It's clean and concise, though one might argue about the interface.</p>

<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;my ($class, @args) = @_;</tt>

<p>How would you recommend using shift for that?  It's a common idiom and again it's fairly clear.  It seems to me that you found an unusual situation where you were bit by <tt>@_</tt> not being cleared, but that seems like a bug in the author's code and not necessarily a bad programming practice.  Admittedly, you now have the data duplicated in the sub, but unless someone is being stupid and passing huge argument lists, this doesn't seem like such a a problem (unless someone uses the above and then tries to diddle with <tt>@_</tt>, at which point they deserve their grief).</p>

<p>I guess this is all a long-winded way of saying that I must be misunderstanding you.</p>

No misunderstanding... I like shift. It's sort of like using warnings and strict.. helps protect you from stupid things that can occur (like this situation, copying large parts of data, inadvertandly having @_ diddled with unexpectedly, etc...) Also, I read code vertically, not horizontally (when scanning code), so 4 or more vertical shifts is better to me than many linear variables.<p>
Most things I write lately uses named params anyways. So there is only 1 or 2 shifts (2 if it is an object, for $self and the args). This is simply more scalable and maintainable (in my opinion).
</p><p>
So, I like shift and will continue to use it unless there is a compelling (or code-wise) reason not to.</p>

<p>Hmm... perhaps you might be the target audience for what is arguably my <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/OVID/Sub-NamedParams-1.01/" title="cpan.org">most useless module</a cpan.org> (<tt>Sub::NamedParams</tt>).</p>

<p>Of course, if I ever get the courage to upload <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=101421" title="perlmonks.org">Acme::Code::Police</a perlmonks.org>, then <em>that</em> will qualify as my most useless module.  I've been hesitant to do so due to potential hate mail -- not to mention lawsuits<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Hmmm... looks like simply passing a hashref is easier than adding a module to pass a hashref<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) But, maybe I'll take a closer peek. I tend to not like using modules to do things which are easy to do without them.
<p>
I still have to upload my Acme::ReturnOne and Acme::ReturnZero to be the two most useless CPAN modules.... EVER!!</p>
