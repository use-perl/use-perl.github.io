<p>I enjoy pop-up/under/sideways free browsing using Safari's built-in pop-up blocking. Until today! I read that Kellie Waymire died. It said she was on Six Feet Under, which I watch.. and couldn't place who she is. I guess she was some recurring hooker that I don't remember at all in the show. Anyways, I was searching for a photo of her, which I couldn't find many.<br/><br/>Anywho... I went to http://www.bestzilla.com/K/Kellie_Waymire/ and all of a sudden.. a full screen pop-up! I closed it, made sure I had blocking enabled (which I did, of course).. reloaded.. and there it was again! Seems like they get around the usual JavaScript pop-ups which Safari blocks.<br/><br/>How? They have a JavaScript called from an onLoad, which submits a form with a new target. Pretty sneaky sis. <br/><br/>Safari is basically all I use, so I'm not sure if this gets around other pop-up blocking technolgies or not.</p>

Auto form submission in onload seems at least as dangerous as window.open()!

Firebird: 1<br>Safari: 0<br> <br>Yeah, this is a good way to get around a blocked open(). I sent a bug report to Apple via the Safari bug report tool. See if they do anything.<br> <br>I also wonder what fun XSS things can be done with this.

Yeah, it took me awhile to find a picture of her, too.  I don't watch the show anymore (unsubscribed to HBO), but once I saw a picture of her, I remembered her character: she was the one Brenda was giving massages to, who got Brenda thinking about doing more sexual experimentation.  Your favorite character!
