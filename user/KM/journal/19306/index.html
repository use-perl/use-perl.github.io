<p>I'm missing YAPC, and it sucks. As some of you know, my wife was rushed to the hospital on Sunday morning. She ended up undergoing major surgery that night having her appendix, a tennis ball sized ovarian cyst, and about a foot of her small intestine removed. She's still in the hospital, and probably will be until the end of the week.. if not more.<br/><br/>Wish I could see all my old and new friends at YAPC this year. But, maybe next year. If anyone wants to drive East for a few hours, let me know :-) I could use a distraction.<br/><br/>I won't be at OSCON either, since all my silent (read: in my head) please to ORA to pay my way have gone unanswered.</p>

<p>I'm very sorry to hear about your wife.  I hope everything turns out for the best.</p>

Thanks, much appreciated. Even 10 minutes before going into surgery, she said "You can still go to the conference." For a second I was like "Oh! Cool!", then figured it was the drugs talking and snapped back to reality.

Actually, your wife was just testing you.  She was giving you one last
opportunity to say, "No, I'll stay here with you while you're in the
hospital."

<p>

Had you actually left the hospital and gone to YAPC, you would have
given your wife an opportunity to go ballistic when you least expect
any time in the next ~20 years.

Hope everything goes well, and she has a speedy recovery.</p>

20 years?  I don't think there is any statute of limitations on "Well, YOU went to your dumb conference when I was in the hospital" being thrown into an argument.

It's a lose/lose situation. At some point I'll likely hear "I know you were thinking about being at the conference while you were sitting by my side and getting me water, ice, cold towels, magazines and helping me move. YOU BASTARD!!"

No, there's no statute of limitations. After 20 years, Kevin is allowed to start using the <i>Come on! That was 20 years ago!</i> defense.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

Or, the more popular "Wasn't me" defense.
