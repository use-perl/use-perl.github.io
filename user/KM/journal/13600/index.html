<div class="span8">
<p>Doing some code refactoring for a client. There is a lot of code which was written by someone else, who didn't seem to have much experience with CPAN, or code design. As I go through it, it seems I say to myself a lot "This should be pulled out, and this too.. and this". I could rewrite the whole thing, but don't want to and won't have the time to do so right now. That would be a long-term goal.<br/><br/>So, right now I am starting with formatting (perltidy, and various things it doesn't catch) so at least it is more readable for maintaining. Also catching various "This could be written better" blocks and snippets which I am fixing. I guess once that is all done I'll chose something to start really making better. Like abstracting the SQL from the main code, incorporating some CPAN modules, and seperating some of the HTML from the code.<br/><br/>Lots of fun doing it though. Every time I do something, anything, with it I know I am making my life easier for down the road.</p>
