<p>For whatever reason, I decided to go back and check out Perl Monks. It's been quite some time since I was there. Also, I had gotten pretty burnt out on the "community" for a while (post YAPC hosting, then TPF Committee chairing, frankly sick of certain peoples attitudes, etc...). But, lately I've been getting back into the swing of things.<br/><br/>Anywho.. a long while ago I stopped visiting Perl Monks because of the trolls, horrible answers, and various annoyances. Plus,  the fact that I swear the site is run off a laptop.. an old laptop.. which is underwater and connected with uninsulated cables. <br/><br/>So, last week I decided to visit. Of course, I forgot my password so I used the "send me my password" thing. An hour later, it arrived. I've now tried about 50 times to get to the Newest Nodes page, and NOT ONCE has it even began to load. <br/><br/>I'm not on dialup, have a zippy MacBook, and tried on Safari, Camino and FF. The site is still slow as a snail. <br/><br/></p>

<h2>Have you tried &quot;Recently Active Threads&quot;?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grantm/">grantm</a> on 2006-12-05T06:25:22</h3>
<p>The Newest Nodes page has been largely superceded by the <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node=Recently%20Active%20Threads" title="perlmonks.org">Recently Active Threads</a perlmonks.org> page.  I find the threaded view much more to my liking and it loads more quickly as well.</p>



<h2>Clearing the nodes since you last visited</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Corion/">Corion</a> on 2006-12-05T08:41:56</h3>
<p>It might be that the list for the nodes that appeared since you last visited is too long - you might want to discard all those nodes by visiting <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=492848" title="perlmonks.org">Newest Nodes Settings</a perlmonks.org> and clearing your "last checked" flag. That way you'll only get 24 hours worth of nodes.</p>

Aha! Much better. See.. I said it's been a while<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>I'd think a "There are a boatlaod of nodes which may never load.. go to your settings..." warning could be used. Thanks Corion.
