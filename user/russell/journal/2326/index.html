<p>The exams are over. The last one, HCI, was harder than I expected. I knew what all the questions were on about, and could answer them, but I felt I didn't give enough detail in most places. Oh well. I'm sure it went alright.<br>
<br>
Went to the students' union bar after with some classmates and had a few drinks, then went to pick up the rest of my coursework when people started to disperse. I passed the software engineering coursework element anyway, couldn't get my HCI one back, but my alphabettically close friend told me he noticed my mark and I  had passed.<br>
<br>
After that we (Bob and I) went to the labs and I upgraded my laptop to Debian testing. It looks very good. University is good for bandwidth :)<br>
<br>
Then I went home and slept. For ages. So I didn't end up going out in the evening anyway (I'd mentioned it to Belfast.pm and BLUG, but no-one replied)...<br>
<br>
Anyway, glad they're over. I'll probably try to get a head-start on my project before uni starts back again. It's great to have free time...</p>
