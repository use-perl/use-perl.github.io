<p>I found a copy of PTerry's <i><a href="http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/0552527521.02.LZZZZZZZ.jpg" alt="gne?">The Carpet People</a></i> while in Borders Books last night. This may not seem much of find to some of you, but finding this in the US has been pretty hard.<p>
Whenever I find imported books of his, they're always slightly warped, and the pages have been gently abused along the edges as if someone had applied a cheese grater to portions of them. I know in my mind that these are probably just books that got abused in stores and couldn't be sold (in the UK, anyway), but I like to think the damage they suffered was sustained in transit to America via Valiant Book Smugglers, seeking to bring the works of Terry Pratchett to the unenlightened.<p>
In other Terry Pratchett news, I found this quote in Strata : <br>
<blockquote><tt>
"I'm proud to be human. Make no mistake! As for the other," he said, turning, "just because you're paranoid doesn't mean They aren't out to get you."
</tt></blockquote>
This book was written in 1981, which makes this the earliest version of the quote I know of -- is this a real live pterryism?

<p>The Borders up in Peabody, MA nearly always has the full range of Pratchett including the maps and such. You could just shop at Amazon.co.uk where they have a whole section devoted to him and have them shipped to you for a little bit more than the tax to buy them locally. The UK book covers are nicer too. He has a new one coming in May.</p>

<p>And the paranoid quote is not originally from Pratchett. Although the source is unknown I'd wager a guess it came from the late 60s drug culture.</p>

<p>I had a poster that said this on my wall in the mid 70s. It was a very common saying at that time.</p>
