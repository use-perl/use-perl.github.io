<p>I just bought a brand new kitchen table and 2 chairs to go with it. No more eating at the couch! woo hoo!<br/>
While we were at the <a href="http://www.4americanfurniture.com/ic294frm.asp">store</a>, I also picked up a big CD rack. Now all my CDs have real and proper homes, rather than being stored in a trunk.<br/>
And, as I suppose is inevitable, they cry out to be cataloged and ripped. While this may be geeky enough for some, I envision this goldbergian (or, if you're british, gormenghastian) contraption made of legos and a barcode scanned that would sort them for me by looking up UPC codes. This device looks vaguely like a library robot in my mind... I have yet to requistion funds from my wife for initial development.</p>

<p>Just rip them.  Then the directory listings of the CDRs you save the rips to, can serve as a catalog of them all.
</p><p>The big question is: OGG or MP3?  On the one hand, I think I like OGG's audio quality better -- less shwishy.</p><p>But on the other hand, at least the OGG encoder I have is much slower than an mp3 encoder running at a comparable bitrate.  Plus OGG makes me think of Brad Kuhn blathering endlessly about software patents, and that's not what I want to think of as I'm trying to put on some Elgar and relax.

</p><p>I also don't like the fact that there's manifest idiocy in the naming system -- the Ogg people want ".ogg" to mean any sort of streaming media file, and insist that an ogg file that contains just that particular audio format that we mere mortals call "Ogg" should really be called "Vorbis" -- which we should know by telepathy or something.  Not since the <a href="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=JFIF" title="ic.ac.uk">"JFIF"</a ic.ac.uk> tsimmis have I ran into such self-defeating jargon scrambling.  I'm bitter!</p>

Not quite adequate, as I'll need to figure out who I'm loaning what out to, or what I can safely give away (3 copies of <a href="http://www.dcdwithin.com/discography.pl?caduceus=spiritchaser" title="dcdwithin.com">Spiritchaser</a dcdwithin.com>?).

D'oh. Must not hit submit prematurely.<p>
Where was I?</p><p>
Oh, as for Ogg vs MP3: It's going to be MP3. I, uh, wish Ogg well and all, but MP3 for me.</p>
