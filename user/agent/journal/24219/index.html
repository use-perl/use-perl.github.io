=to       ...4.13.12:05.PM<br/><br/>I noticed that reactions from the model-solver back to the model builder can bring huge profit to us. Model builder can decide what to do next with respect to the solutions of previously-built models, or even use the solutions directly to speed up or guide the ensuing model building process. This strategy of problem-solving can be extremely powerful! However, a CIR-to-Maple compiler can't do the tricks elegantly. What we want is a true interpreter that outputs nothing but the ultimate solutions and that has the ability to invoke Maple solver directly, so as to get model-solving results on the fly! Oh, that's very cool, I must say!<br/><br/>The most sophisticated part of such design is how to handle potential parallel solutions to a single model, which will lead to very complicated case-by-case considerations and backtracking behaviors. Luckily, parallel solutions are rarely seen in the problem-domain of linear circuit analysis. So it is reasonable to just ignore parallel solutions at this early stage of development.<br/><br/>The easiest way of realizing runtime model solving is invoking cmaple.exe via pipes, receiving its output, and then using the grepsol.pl tool to pick up the name-value pairs the model builder is concerned about. That's really simple, though not robust enough and not efficient either. After all, it will work in most common cases.
