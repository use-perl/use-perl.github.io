=to ...5.13.0:30.AM<br/><br/>I try to keep writing journals with the aim of getting more and more people interested in what I am doing. Unfortunately, I often find myself too busy to summarize one day's work. It really puts me to shame that Autrijus Tang seldom skips any journals though he currently has his hands full in Pugs' development.<br/><br/>It should be mentioned that Clover asked for the address of my journals the other night. I was feeling honored and happily provided the URL.<br/><br/>Life becomes less insane since I released Thief 0.03 and made the decision to compile comprehensible summaries for the textbook "Computer Organization" a few days ago. Yeah, it requires a lot of effort and great patience because a wide variety of principles and techniques need to be memorized. Anyway, I believe it's worth my while.<br/><br/>I had a plan to learn how to program with Pentium instructions and old 8086 assembly language by virtue of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vcmasm/html/vcoriMicrosoftAssemblerMacroLanguage.asp">Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM)</a>. This may be the first step towards the splendid milestone of writing an operating system of my own!</p>

I've tried to even understand a bit of what you're saying, and keep missing the mark.
<p>
Getting other's involved first starts by establishing a background context and realm of terminologies.  You're starting somewhere in the middle.  No joy.</p>

Likewise<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>I keep on reading because I feel that eventually I'll understand what this is all about, but I haven't, yet O:-)

</p> <p>I am now relieved to see that I'm not the only one<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>

There is secret context that only chinese can understand, hence me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

If you two are just trolling, that's a bit childish.
<p>
On the other hand, if you two are conspiring to break chinese internet firewalls, using use.perl.org as a rendevous point, you're probably overstepping your welcome as a guest here.
</p> <p>
Or, you can just explain the "chinese" comment, and we'll go about our business.</p>

i guess that is a bad joke to you. I have no intention to make you feeling all of the above.

I'm puzzled about what you mean by "you two".<br> <br>I don't know qiang, and I know nothing about "chinese firewalls" or "rendevous point" either.

I'm very sorry for the lack of necessary background context in my journals. I really appreciate your great patience.<br> <br>I will provide a detailed background some time later. I appologize again for my ignorance.
