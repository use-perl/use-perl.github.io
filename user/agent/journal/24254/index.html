<p>=from     2005.4.18.8:05.AM
=to       ...4.18.9:05.AM<br/><br/>Yesterday morning I went to the southern campus of <a href="http://www.just.edu.cn/">the Jiangsu University of Science and Technology</a> giving Chen Xiaohui (Persian cat) and her roommates the first lesson on Visual FoxPro.<br/><br/>To my surprise, the girls managed to find an empty classroom for this class, which seems almost impossible in my university.<br/><br/>In the class, I introduced the basic concepts of database to the three girls by illustrating some real-world databases I had ever maintained. I tried my best to make the notions of application layer, logic layer, database tables, and etc. clear enough to the students who were all majored in Tourism. My first lesson ended up being a great success; the feedback from the students was quite satisfactory.<br/><br/>After the class, the girls and their monitor invited me to dinner in their school's dining hall. During the lunch, two other boys in their class came too, one of whom is named Wang Yongbin.<br/><br/>When we finished, Xiaohui asked Yongbin and one of her roommates, Huang Chunfang to see me off from the campus, and then she said goodbye to me, going to a meeting with their monitor.<br/><br/>Yongbin and Chunfang both refused to leave me until they saw I'd boarded the bus No. 18 and had been driven away. I clearly remember that when I asked them back home while we were waiting for a bus at the bus stop, Yongbin just replied, "Well, I know it's a boring experience to wait for a bus alone. So we'll stay with you untill the bus comes." I even couldn't say a single word at that moment; I was greatly moved.<br/><br/>In the afternoon I went on with my work on CirSys and managed to port all my 38 integration tests to MATLAB, which was really an important milestone for this project. From then on, the great number of MATLAB users can run CirSys without install anything else! Whee!<br/><br/>I'm wondering if the following Maple command works in MATLAB:<br/><br/>    interface(imaginaryunit=j);<br/><br/>If it does, I will solve the naming problem involving the imaginary unit in a neat way.</p>
