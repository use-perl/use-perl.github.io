<p><h2><div>Sep 21 (to Sun Xin~)</a></h2>
<p>our charming XML instructor today asked me to give one or two talks in her class because she 
thought i was an expert in this domain. i'm very excited and have decided to make some good-
looking slides in both english and chinese. i'll work on the new slides for the coming talks in 
the next few days. i'll send them to you for review once they are ready.</p>
<p>i'll also send you a bunch of
 <a href="http://perlcabal.org/agent/slides/patterns/patterns.xul">_old_slides_</a> 
for the talk given in the last term tomorrow. they're 
in pure english and most of my classmates liked it. i hope you can proofread the old slides 
since i'm going to publish them on the web.</p>
<p>Our XML instructor is so beautiful that i dare say a lot of boys in the classroom like her very much. she holds great charm for me. i love to talk to her after the class. talking to her 
in person is really enjoyable. she is an extremely lovely girl. yay for her beauty and good 
mood!</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><div>Sep 22 (to Sun Xin~)</a></h2>
<p>mails sent. remember to use Firefox to access the .xul URL (i.e. the slides) and don't click 
too fast while reading the slides since loading images can be slow.</p>
<p>btw, i'll use cherry's qzone blogs as a study case in my new slides for the XML talk. the 
slide-making process can be fun! stay tuned! :)</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><div>Sep 22 (to Jack Shen~)</a></h2>
<p>hey, jack. let me talk about microcosmic stuff, such as interface design for individual classes
or small class library and you talk about the handwavy macroscopical things like large OO systems.
i'll try my best to put enough basic weapons under the audience's belt before your lectures.
what's your opinion?</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><div>Sep 23 (to Sun Xin~)</a></h2>
<p>my instructors have asked me to give for total 12 talks this semester. that's really wonderful
since i can take a more leisure pace during my talks. but i definitely need many more slides
and pictures. i'll be talking about XML, Regular expressions (regexes) and object-oriented
modeling and design. what cool stuff!</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><div>Sep 27 (to Sun Xin~)</a></h2>
<p>i've produced 82 slides these two days, and i am about to crash... for my first talk, there
are still 20 slides to go... it's really exciting!!! man!!!</p>
<p>man, i've sent a weird english poetry to you for translating. i need the chinese transcript
for my slides. please get back to me ASAP. it's quite urgent since the talk is scheduled on
*this* Friday evening. thank you in advance. :)</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><div>Sep 27 (to Cherry Chu~)</a></h2>
<p>our XML teacher has asked me to give one or two talks to my classmates in her class. and
i am going to use *your* Qzone blogs as a study case in my slides. :)</p>
<p>will you mind my introduction to your Qzone home? btw, an even shorter URL is working now:
<a href="http://perlcabal.org/agent/cherry.html">http://perlcabal.org/agent/cherry.html</a>. feel free to give it a shot.</p>
<p>...glad to hear that. i have 16 lectures to give out this semester. i've been busy making
slides for my talks. it is a hard job but is also fun. :)</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><div>Sep 29 (to Sun Xin~)</a></h2>
<p>the
 <a href="http://perlcabal.org/agent/slides/naming/naming.xul">talk</a> 
was a big success. the audience laughed a lot and i was often stopped by the
girl students' ``wow''. my instructor said after the talk that he was exceedingly impressed.
he told me that it had given him great inspiration and determination. he said he had
even been pondering giving up his C.S. career, but my talk completely changed his mind.</p>
<p>...nah. cherry didn't come because she is in a different department and i had not invited
her to my talk.</p>
<p>...sorry, i didn't show your transcript explicitly in my slides. Audrey
 <a href="http://colabti.de/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2006-09-29,Fri&sel=144#l220">offered</a> 
a translation in ancient chinese right before the talk and i used hers. but your work had
helped me a lot. without your translation, i can't grok that poem to such an extend.
thank you!</p>
<p>it's worth mentioning that Larry Wall also
 <a href="http://colabti.de/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2006-09-29,Fri&sel=120#l181">provided</a> 
me with an excellent translation in
modern english. you know, he is a great linguist. :)</p>
<p>...LOL. lucky indeed. getting so much help and support is like a dream!</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><div>Sep 30 (to Cherry Chu~)</a></h2>
<p>Heh, it will rain tomorrow anyway. hopefully the weather will get better when you
come back from shanghai. :)</p>
<p>...nope, not that one. i was talking about the art of naming. the talk mentioning your
Qzone space will be given on Oct 14, which is about XML in the real world.</p>
<p>Sun Xin asked me last night if cherry had attended my talk. and i explained to him
that you are in a different department and sadly i had not sent you an invitation.</p>
<p>The talk was on this Friday evening. and i'll give talks at that time for every week
from now on. we are at Z101. welcome joining us! 9th and 10th classes. :)</p>
<p>...nah, chinese speech mostly. every slide contains two versions of the content,
the chinese version and the english version. and yeah, there'll be many students
in my class. don't worry. :)</p>
<p>it will simply rock if you can come. for another thing, i really hope you can also
attend my XML talk because i'm going to show my classmates your blogs there. he he.</p>
<p>the XML talk has been scheduled at 10504, 7th or 8th class. the concrete date is
still undecided. i'll tell you once i had talked to our XML instructor. OK?</p>
<p>...(agent does his happy dance.)</p>
<p>the XML talk should be on Thursday afternoon, btw.</p>
<p>cherry, i have the idea of writing journals based on my cellphone messages. it's
a great source of materials, you know. of course, i won't public any messages that
i've received from others. for example, your replies will be excluded while my
messages to you will probably be shown. what's your opinion? will you mind?</p>
