<p>=from     2005.4.16.8:05.AM
=to       ...4.16.9:10.AM<br/><br/>I was delighted when Wan Xunxin and Zhang Xin respectively promised to plot circuit diagrams and contribute more integration test cases for my CirSys project. That's really very good news to me.<br/><br/>Wan Xunxin spent only one hour last night in learning how to draw circuit diagrams in MS Visio 2003, and he quickly got his way and produced high-quality pictures. Well done, Xin!<br/><br/>I plan to sketch out an Overview and a FAQ documents this weekend for CirSys, which are doubtlessly important to end-users. I should refer to Pugs' Overview and Parrot's FAQ first, I think.<br/><br/>Zhang Xin requested an AC implementation of CirSys. I suggested we test dc sub-system thoroughly before any ac-specific efforts. He happily accepted it.<br/><br/>This morning I'm going to raise the number of integration tests in the CirSys tester up to 60. Thanks to the basic implementation of @assume, which makes it possible. :^)<br/><br/>Last night I also tested CirSys' compatibility with MATLAB on Wang Longzhi's machine, which revealed a potential naming problem with identifier "i". Maple 9 uses capital letter "I" to denote the imaginary unit, say, sqrt(-1), whereas the maple interface provided by MATLAB prefers lowercase letter "i". This minor difference really hurt my tester seriously since I had used the name "i" extensively in my CIR scripts to indicate electric current quantities. Thus I have to play some naming tricks to fix this problem. For example, I may substitute "my_i" for all "i". Things will get more involved if we really want to say something referring to sqrt(-1) in CIR and we also hope our scripts can be accepted both by Maple and MATLAB. Perhaps we will have to say "sqrt(-1)" explicitly. Hopefully I'm able to think up an encompassing solution in the next few days.
