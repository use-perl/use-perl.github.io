<p>=from     2005.4.19.11:50.AM
=to       ...4.19.12:05.PM<br/><br/>I've been reading the POD documents shipped with the <a href="http://www.parrotcode.org/">Parrot</a> distribution. It seems to me that the Parrot assembly language is quite simple. I regard it as something similar to 8086 assembly language but with powerful string handling capabilities and a funny register type named PMC (Parrot Magic Cookie). I think I'd offer my own implementation of Parrot assembler using perl for an exercise and I may write some toy compilers that target Parrot too.<br/><br/>I'm considering the issue of applying Parrot to my studies in university. Is it related to Computer Organization? Um, no obvious relationship, I'm afraid. Sigh.<br/><br/>I will add the last 8 integration tests (say, real-world problems from textbooks) to my CirSys tester. Thus we will have in total 60 integration tests this evening. That's great!<br/><br/>Now that I have a rather stable dc subsystem of CirSys, I don't feel like going any further with the dc stuff now. So I'm embarking on the design and implementation of the ac subsystem.<br/><br/>For the sake of apparent parallelity between dc and ac libraries, I think it's a bad idea to maintain two similar versions of Elem.pm and Wire.pm respectively. I'd come up with an alternative solution. I would only maintain one version of Elem.pm and one copy of Wire.pm for both dc and ac systems, but use a global variable, for instance, $Subsystem, to denote the current system (ac or dc) that is in effect. This sounds more feasible, but I soon realized that in essence I'm using branch statements (like "if" or "switch") to check the specialized "types" of object on the fly, which is considered to be a bad design from the viewpoint of OOP, or more precisely, from the view of polymorphism. A better design is using the inheritance feature of OO. Specifically, we can refactor the class hierarchy as following:<br/><br/>    Steady::Wire
        |
        |--- ac::Wire
        |--- dc::Wire<br/><br/>    Steady::Elem
        |
        |--- ac::Resistor
        |--- ac::Inductor
        |--- ac::Capacitor
        |--- ...
        |--- dc::Resistor
        |--- ...<br/><br/>The introduction of Steady::* class level can make the ac and dc subsystems share most of their common code, decreasing the cost of maintenance sharply, which is exactly what we are expecting. Cool!<br/><br/>Okay, when I register all the integration tests I prepared, I'll release CirSys 0.07 and rapidly move to version 0.08 so as to refactor the module structure and offer a working implementation of ac subsystem. Aha!</p>
