<blockquote cite="http://consttype.blogspot.com/2009/07/darkpan-matters.html"><p>Who&#8217;s trying to be realistic by attempting to release software with some quality expectations, notably by making the upgrade process seamless and introducing as little bugs as possible?</p></blockquote>

<p>The problem with that argument is that 5.10.0 <em>did</em> contain regressions.</p>

<p>That the rarity of releases is justified by the high quality standards being adhered to is, unfortunately, merely polite fiction. What it all boils down to is simple:</p>

<p><em>Shit happens.</em></p>

<p>No matter how much we&#8217;d like for it to be otherwise, <em>shit happens</em>. The release process needs to be reality-based: it needs to deal with the very real fact that <em>shit happens</em> and <em>has in fact already happened</em>. The only realistic way to deal with that is for releases to be easy enough that the shit that <em>does</em> invariably happen can be dealt with soon enough, so that it won&#8217;t cause too many people too much trouble.</p>

<p>And the best way to make releases easy is to make them frequently.</p>

<p>And the simplest (though not only) way to ensure that is to put them on a schedule.</p>

<p>That is all.</p>

<p><cite><a href="http://consttype.blogspot.com/2009/07/time-based-releases-in-open-source.html" title="Time-based releases in open source ">Rafa&#235;l Garcia-Suarez</a></cite>:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://consttype.blogspot.com/2009/07/time-based-releases-in-open-source.html"><p>Whenever I hear someone saying <i>we should have regular releases</i>, I hear <i>we should release when Venus enters Pisces</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is your misunderstanding, then: what they are really saying is <i>we need a reliable plan for dealing with accidents</i>. If you can make that happen without sticking to scheduled releases, that&#8217;s fine too.</p>

<p>Yes: releasing often does not affect the quality of software by itself. But releasing it rarely almost certainly <em>will</em> &#8211; negatively. Because <em>shit happens</em>.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like it either! But that&#8217;s reality for you. I doesn&#8217;t care what you like. It just is.</p></p>

<h2>Absolutely...</h2>

<p>Yeah, I'm assuming there's a "not" missing there and, based on that assumption, I absolute agree.</p><p>I have trouble understanding the arguments against adopting a regular release schedule. The implication is that quality will suffer if releases are made based on the date rather than the readiness of the code - which would be true if the pumpking just bundled and shipped whatever was in the repo at that point in time - but that's not at all what's being proposed. And co-opting DarkPAN to endorse the current release policy just sounds like religion to me: "we're not sure what it is, how much of it there is or even if it exists but we'd better not piss it off."</p>

<blockquote><div><p><nobr> <wbr></nobr><em>... but that's not at all what's being proposed.</em></p></div> </blockquote><p>That's my biggest objection to the whole debate.  I don't particularly like being called a liar, a traitor, an astrologer, a do-nothing blowhard, or a saboteur, but having ideas on which I've expounded voluminously waved away with such mischaracterizing dismissal is unpleasant.</p>

Indeed. I got carried away by my own analogy.

<p>And also that there&#8217;s a lot of it. But it doesn&#8217;t get any more tangible than that.</p><p>And in reality the question is how to balance the needs of the past DarkPAN against the needs of the future DarkPAN. Also, how much past DarkPAN code is affected by the regressions of 5.10.0? It&#8217;s not one unknown pushing back; there&#8217;s an equally big unknown pushing forward that is rarely ever considered.</p>

I couldn't understand what Nicholas was trying to say when he posted in 'Those who cannot learn from history' this sorry, sorry link
<p>
<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.meta/2001/02/msg647.html" title="perl.org">http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.meta/2001/02/msg647.html</a perl.org>
</p><p>

Now I do. Look at it and blush those of you who are happy at driving out a productive volunteer.
</p><p>
At least silly Simon could eventually apologize before he too crashed and burned.
</p><p>
Do I think the frequent release schedule is helping Parrot ? Not as much as Jonathan is. At the moment the focus is right back on the performance of the VM that Dan was so adamant about. Have those that succeeeded him really made a better Parrot ?
</p><p>
P6 is moving forward because the spec is in an implementable state. Not because Dan was wasting time, or not doing something someone else felt was better PR.</p>
