<p><p>This entry was inspired by a conversation in which I mentioned my attendance of the Hackathon to a non-programmer friend. How do you explain to them what hacking means?</p>

<p>A lot of definitions of the term have been attempted over the years. The one that&#8217;s always stuck with me was the one established by the Chaos Computer Club: in German, &#8220;der respektlose Umgang mit Technik,&#8221; which means &#8220;the irreverent handling/use of technology.&#8221; I&#8217;ve always liked it because it&#8217;s broad enough to capture that the essence of a hack is a particular mindset and not what thing is employed for the hack.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s also always irritated me, because it captures the mindset indirectly via one somewhat incidental artifact: the stated irreverence is just a result of a mindset that precludes being limited by the conceived purpose(s) of the tool. The statement is also vague enough that it can&#8217;t possibly stand on its own, requiring examples or a long-winded explanation to give it legs.</p>

<p>So in this chat, I managed to accidentally come up with a definition that &#8211; by my own perception anyway &#8211; is more precise than the CCC&#8217;s without being so flailingly hand-waving as it&#8217;s typical for such definition attempts. What I stumbled into is that hacking is &#8220;<b>the act of making a tool do something, motivated at least in part by the joy of the creative process of getting it to do that</b>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tool in question doesn&#8217;t have to be a computer. It might be a mere pocket knife. Likewise, the goal doesn&#8217;t have to be self-amusement. It might just be to earn one&#8217;s next salary. But it&#8217;s not hacking if you can&#8217;t appreciate the act for its own sake, and it&#8217;s not hacking if such an application of the tool is obvious.</p>

<p>It amuses me how I got there. I didn&#8217;t want to get into philosophical navel-gazing about what hacking is (nevermind that I did anyway), so my first iteration was simply &#8220;programming.&#8221; But it&#8217;s broader than just programming; so after some thought and deliberation, the second iteration was &#8220;making a computer do something.&#8221; It&#8217;s not a long step from there to &#8220;making a tool do something.&#8221; Now just add a qualification that it&#8217;s done for the joy of doing it and there you are.</p>

<p>It really isn&#8217;t that complicated.</p></p>
