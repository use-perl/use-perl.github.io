<p><p>Written for and performed at the RIPE 55 Secret Working Group Session, by <cite><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=phSpBCdWq1U">Gary Feldman</a></cite> [YouTube]:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A long, long time ago<br />
I can still remember<br />
when my laptop could connect elsewhere<br />
And I tell you all there was a day<br />
the network card I threw away<br />
had a purpose and it worked for you and me</p>

<p>But 18 years completely wasted<br />
with each address we&#8217;ve aggregated<br />
the tables overflowing<br />
the traffic just stopped flowing</p>

<p>And now we&#8217;re bearing all the scars<br />
and all my traceroutes showing stars<br />
The packets would travel faster in cars<br />
the day the routers died</p>

<p><i>Chorus (ALL!!!!!)</i>:<br />
So bye bye, folks at RIPE 55<br />
Be persuaded to upgrade it or your network will die<br />
IPv6 just makes me let out a sigh<br />
But I suppose we better give it a try<br />
I suppose we better give it a try</p>

<p>Now did you write an RFC<br />
that dictated how it all should be<br />
Did we listen like we should that day<br />
Now were you back at RIPE 54<br />
where we heard the same things months before<br />
and the people knew they&#8217;d have to change their ways</p>

<p>And we knew that all the ISPs<br />
could be future proofed for centuries<br />
but that was then not now<br />
Spent too much time playing WoW</p>

<p>Oh there was time we sat on IRC<br />
making jokes on how this day would be<br />
Now there&#8217;s no more use for TCP<br />
the day the routers died</p>

<p><i>Chorus (chime in now)</i>:<br />
So bye bye, folks at RIPE 55<br />
Be persuaded to upgrade it or your network will die<br />
IPv6 just makes me let out a sigh<br />
But I suppose we better give it a try<br />
I suppose we better give it a try</p>

<p>I remember those old days I mourn<br />
sitting in my room, downloading porn<br />
Yeah that&#8217;s how it used to be</p>

<p>When the packets flowed from A to B<br />
via routers that could talk IP<br />
there was data that could be exchanged between you and me</p>

<p>Oh but I could see you all ignore<br />
the fact we&#8217;d fill up IPv4<br />
but we all lost the nerve<br />
and we got what we deserved</p>

<p>And while we threw our network kit away<br />
and wished we&#8217;d heard the things they say<br />
Put all our lives in disarray<br />
the day the routers died</p>

<p><i>Chorus (those silent will be shot)</i>:<br />
So bye bye, folks at RIPE 55<br />
Be persuaded to upgrade it or your network will die<br />
IPv6 just makes me let out a sigh<br />
But I suppose we better give it a try<br />
I suppose we better give it a try</p>

<p>Saw a man with whom I used to peer<br />
asked him to rescue my career<br />
He just sighed and turned away</p>

<p>I went down to the net cafe<br />
that I used to visit everyday<br />
but the man there said I might as well just leave</p>

<p>And now we&#8217;ve all lost our purpose<br />
My Cisco share&#8217;s completely worthless<br />
No future meetings for me<br />
at the Hotel Krasnapolsky</p>

<p>And the men that make us push and push<br />
like Geoff Huston and Randy Bush<br />
Should&#8217;ve listened to what they told us<br />
the day the routers died</p>

<p>And we&#8217;re singing:</p>

<p><i>Chorus (time to lose your voice)</i>:<br />
So bye bye, folks at RIPE 55<br />
Be persuaded to upgrade it or your network will die<br />
IPv6 just makes me let out a sigh<br />
But I suppose we better give it a try</p>
