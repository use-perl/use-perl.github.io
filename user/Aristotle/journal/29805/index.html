<p><p>I finally stuck a fork in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Atom-SimpleFeed/">XML::Atom::SimpleFeed</a> and shipped it. It took ten entire months because I completely rewrote its innards no less than <em>six times</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li>First I switched it to inside-out object style and <abbr title="Simple API for XML">SAX</abbr>-based output generation;</li>
<li>then I reverted to a hash-based object where instead of storing all the data in instance variables, I generated <abbr title="Simple API for XML">SAX</abbr> events immediately, with the option to buffer them in a spool which would eventually be played back to a real <abbr title="Simple API for XML">SAX</abbr> writer &#8211; all this to cope with the fact that the <abbr title="Application Programmer's Interface">API</abbr> as designed wasn&#8217;t well suited for streaming output;</li>
<li>then I got sick of <abbr title="Simple API for XML">SAX</abbr> and stopped caring about streaming, but wanted a more declarative approach, so I designed a model based on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-LibXML/">XML::LibXML</a> in which I cloned and walked pre-parsed <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> snippets, dispatching based on attributes in a private namespace (talk about boiling the ocean);</li>
<li>then I switched to a scalar reference for the object, to which I appended output from a <code>CGI.pm</code> instance that I had ritually abused to make it make my desired <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> for me;</li>
<li>until I had sickened myself enough that I resigned to writing my own minimal <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> writer, around which time I also decided to restructure both the code and docs to closely follow the way the RFC 4287 document flows, which finally brought some clarity to the code layout;</li>
<li>and lastly, I broke the 0.7 <abbr title="Application Programmer's Interface">API</abbr> to make it both simpler/prettier on the outside and saner to implement on the inside.</li>
</ol>

<p>All this on a limited supply of spare tuits.</p>

<p>I need to work on not letting perfect be the enemy of good; it would have been much better to <em>just ship</em> something, anything, as soon as possible, rather than stagnate &#8211; if only seemingly &#8211; for almost a year.</p>

<p>But <strong>at long last</strong>, the <abbr title="Comprehensive Perl Archive Network">CPAN</abbr> has <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Atom-SimpleFeed/" title="XML::Atom::SimpleFeed">a module with which you can generate Atom 1.0 with minimal fuss</a>. It took <em>Long Enough</em>. Share and enjoy.</p></p>

After being exposed to XML::Atom in order to write <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/subatom/" title="cpan.org">subatom</a cpan.org>, I'm enourmously happy to see a sane alternative.  I'll be switching as soon as I get a moment.
