<blockquote cite="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/jim-weirich-discusses-rake">
<p>I feel the term has probably been overused. I like to consider a Domain Specific Language to be something that talks about [a] problem domain, such as configuring workflow to solve some business problems or [&#8230;] something that is business related in the problem space. And I see a lot of us using Domain Specific Languages to solve programmer problems, which are really problems in the solution space.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>What I want to use a DSL for is I want to be able to take a problem that a user comes to me and [&#8230;] create a DSL that describes it. I don&#8217;t think that the business person needs to be able to write the DSL, but I should be able to write it in the DSL, show it to a business person and they can say: &#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s what I want&#8221; and it is something that is immediately obvious to them that it solves their problem domain. It&#8217;s Domain Specific Language and if it is not addressing a domain, the term DSL seems kind of loose for me.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>So I think you can have libraries with good interfaces but that doesn&#8217;t necessarily make them DSLs, certainly dropping parenthesis off a library call doesn&#8217;t make it a DSL.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a refreshing perspective.</p>

<p>This is the first time I have heard someone give a definition of &#8220;DSL&#8221; that is restrictive enough to have actual meaning. Later on he also gives a similarly reasonable definition of BDD, Behaviour-Driven Development. (His first statement? There&#8217;s no difference between BDD and TDD.)</p>
