<p><p>I took over <a href="http://p3rl.org/Getopt::Auto">this module</a> from Simon Cozens nearly 5 years ago when <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/petdance/journal/20904">he gave away his modules</a>, but never got around to any of my ideas for it. What was I thinking? In hindsight, I don&#8217;t get around to my own ideas for comparable lengths of time; I should never have applied for it.</p>

<p>I did start a refactor at some point that&#8217;s still sitting in my projects directory, but in all honesty I didn&#8217;t get very far before losing steam. I even delayed writing this note, thinking I&#8217;d get around to making my changes available, but they&#8217;re insubstantial and unfinished and it really doesn&#8217;t matter any more. There&#8217;s a patch in the RT queue that&#8217;s been sitting there for years. I didn&#8217;t think the patch too great, but it would have been better to apply it and release than leave it in limbo waiting for a reformulation that I&#8217;d never get around to.</p>

<p>It is time to admit defeat. I&#8217;ve been a bad steward.</p>

<p>Is there anyone reading this who cares about the module? Want to take it over?</p></p>

Can I give it a shot?
The module seems fairly magical, but at least I'd like to try.

<p>If you want to get a feel first, go right ahead, the source is on CPAN. Actually&#8230; scratch that, I&#8217;ve just <a href="http://github.com/ap/Getopt--Auto" title="github.com">pushed my stuff to GitHub</a github.com>. Anyway, if you want to take a look first, check that out.</p><p>It&#8217;s not very magical on the implementation end of things, actually.</p><p>Let me know if you want to pick it up.</p>
