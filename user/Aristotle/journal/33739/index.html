<h2>a genetic correlate</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mr_bean/">mr_bean</a> on 2007-07-08T02:57:31</h3>
This reminds me of a phenomenon in genetics I was reading about in wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift" title="wikipedia.org">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift</a wikipedia.org><br><br>"In  population  genetics,  genetic  drift  is  the statistical effect that results from the influence that chance has on the survival of  alleles  (variants  of  a  gene).  The effect may cause an allele  and  the  biological  trait that it confers to become more common or more rare over successive generations. Ultimately, the drift may  either  remove  the  allele  from the gene pool or remove all other  alleles.  Whereas  natural  selection  is  the  tendency of beneficial  alleles  to  become more common over time (and detrimental ones  less  common),  genetic drift is the fundamental tendency of any allele  to  vary  randomly  in  frequency over time due to statistical variation  alone,  so  long as it does not comprise all or none of the distribution."<br><br>"Given  sufficiently long time, however, the mathematics  of  genetic drift (cf. Galton-Watson process) predict the  allele  will  either  die  out  or  be  present  in  100%  of the population,  after  which  time  there  is  no random variation in the associated  gene.  Thus genetic drift tends to sweep gene variants out  of  a  population  over  time, such that all members of a species would  eventually  be  homozygous  for  this gene. In this regard, genetic  drift  opposes  genetic  mutation  which introduces novel variants into the population according to its own random processes."

Well, in a natural ecosystem everyone (or every gene) is just trying to survive long enough to reproduce a lot.  Why do we start decaying at 30?  Because we're past our reproductive years at that point, and therefore useless.  On the other hand, in an economic system, whoever dies with the most toys wins, so there's no such thing as "enough money."

<p>As an aside, I think this touches on the biggest mistake people make about large-scale, first-world markets: that they are driven by some sort of diverse consumer tastes.  In fact, it is just the opposite.  For breakfast cereal, clothing, toothpaste, and many other things, there isn't a difference that makes a difference between the possible options.  However, one of them is most profitable to produce, and efficiencies of scale make this option even cheaper.  So consumers are told that they prefer whatever is cheapest to produce, and they happily "choose" and consume it.  Why do wild animals spread into new ecosystems, while herds stick together?</p>

&gt; so there's no such thing as "enough money."<br><br>Yes. This has been spelled out in the fascinating book:<br>Adam's Curse<br>Bryan Sykes<br>0 552 14989 6<br>Eg: Top of page 295

Thanks for the reference.  I will give it a read.

<h2>The Evolution of Cooperation</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2007-07-08T13:24:34</h3>
<p>In Axelrod's book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evolution_of_Cooperation" title="wikipedia.org">The Evolution of Cooperation</a wikipedia.org> it's made quite clear than even companies/organisations that hate each other will tend towards a cartel/duopoly and finally monopolies. There is nothing within the mechanism of the market that will stop this from happening it's an automatic output from the mathematics. To prevent monopolies you need something external to destabilise the system, which could be the right kind of government legislation (the book contains examples that make things worse) or a new entry into the market place.</p>

<p>Basically cooperating even when you are fighting tool and nail can be the best strategy under certain conditions.</p>
