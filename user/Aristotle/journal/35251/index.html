You seem to have mistyped your link.  Was the article supposed to be related to the text of your post?

<p>The post is perfectly correct&#8230; are you merely confused (presumably because I made an unclear mental leap) or do you disagree with my argument?</p>

Probably a bit of both.  I read the article as "rich girl with a disease and a publicist dies."  Her parents bought her insurance on the free market, and if her parents really wanted the operation, they could have paid for it directly.  So I'm confused.

<p>Is your implication, Herr Freie Marktwirtschaft, that socialist health systems are better adapted to providing for experimental surgery than those based on freemarket systems?</p>

That the surgery was considered "experimental" was a  perspective taken by the insurance company, and may not be shared by all professionals.<br><br>The insurance companies make more profit when they spend less on treating illnesses, including denying coverage for things they can get away with claiming   are experimental.<br><br>In socialized medicine, doctors are more able to treat without regard for the patients ability to pay and may receive incentives for improving health, such has helping patients quit smoking.
