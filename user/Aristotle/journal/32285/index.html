<p><p>I had known that there are lots of cameras over there, but reading <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a>&#8217;s LiveJournal got me to pay a bit more attention lately. It has been&#8230; interesting indeed. The following have been chosen with care to maximise sarcasm potential for your&#8230; entertainment-of-sorts:</p>

<ol>

<li><p><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,176-2438047,00.html" title="Times Online: &#8216;Superman&#8217; scanner to spot bombers">They&#8217;re installing backscatter cameras that can render clothes invisble in public spaces</a> &#8211; in order to fight terrorism, of course.</p></li>

<li><p>Meanwhile, despite all the cameras, <a href="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/story_pages/news/news2.shtml" title="News of the World: 322 sex fiends loose">they managed to lose track of <em>322</em> sex offenders</a>! It makes perfect sense if you think about it, though &#8211; the pervs have taken over the CCTV control room bunkers.</p></li>

<li><p>And who <em>wants</em> to find them? After all, <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article2192984.ece" title="The Independent: Waiting lists for prisoners">jails are so full they&#8217;re considering waiting lists for convicts</a>; up to and including burglars and violent assailants. &#8220;You have been sentenced to 3 years in jail. Go home and stay there, we&#8217;ll come by to pick you up in 2009.&#8221;</p></li>

<li><p>How is all this evesdropping equipment paid for anyway? Well, <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/01/26/grabbers_dont_grab/" title="The Register: School fingerprinters say they don't grab teaching cash">the fingerprint scanners in schools are charged to the teaching aids budget</a>, at least.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>Even after subtracting all comedic malice and tinfoil hats, this really doesn&#8217;t paint a very reassuring big picture.</p></p>

Because, y'know, Tony, like says it's alright.<br/><br/>And besides, it's all small fry compared to when the ID cards debacle hits...
