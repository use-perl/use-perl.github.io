<blockquote cite="http://www.patrickrobin.co.uk/default.asp?Display=4">
<p>That&#8217;s right, my blogging software is being used by the MPAA (Motion picture Association of America); probably one of the most hated organisations known to the internet. Cool, I thought, until I had a look around and saw that all of the back links to my main site had been removed with nary a mention in the source code! [&#8230;] Now I know I&#8217;m not exactly reknowned for my legalese but I did think that the terms and conditions that I had released Forest Blog under were pretty solid, specifically the section relating to removing the back links:</p>
<blockquote><p>You may not remove, alter or otherwise disable all or any of the hyperlinks to the Host Forest website (http://www.hostforest.co.uk). All images, links or text must remain unchanged and intact and visible when the pages are viewed unless you first obtain explicit written permission from the copyright holders.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that the decision to remove the back links was made by some individual rather than a commitee at the MPAA but I find it surprising anyone working there would be so remiss to remove these links just because I let people download and use Forest Blog for free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#8217;t find it surprising at all.</p></p>
