<br />&lt;Dick&gt;&nbsp; hm, reminds me of 4th year, one guy's computer kept getting the name of the weekday wrong
<br />&lt;Dick&gt;&nbsp; turns out another 4th year had hacked in and changed the strings in his libc6 english locale file :)
<br />&lt;Harry&gt;&nbsp;Man, I'm totally gonna do that to Joe
<br />&lt;Dick&gt;&nbsp; yeah, it's a good trick... really hard to track down
<br />&lt;Dick&gt;&nbsp; especially if it only happens on mondays :)
<br />&lt;Tom&gt; &nbsp; I did that to Jack once
<br />&lt;Tom&gt; &nbsp; early january a few (7) years ago
<br />&lt;Tom&gt; &nbsp; I changed his locale, changing Monday to Mondak, January to Januark etc
<br />&lt;Tom&gt; &nbsp; and set that as the system wide default
<br />&lt;Tom&gt; &nbsp; that left him very confused
<br />&lt;Dick&gt;&nbsp; I remember one guy had a directory full of sarah-michelle geller pictures, and changed his background every 15 minutes to a random picture...
<br />&lt;Dick&gt;&nbsp; I managed to copy a photo of our lecturer into that directory
<br />&lt;Dick&gt;&nbsp; and was lucky enough to be in the lab when it eventually was randomly chosen
<br />&lt;Harry&gt;&nbsp;bwahahaha
<br />&lt;Tom&gt; &nbsp; yeah we had some SMG fans around too
<br />&lt;Tom&gt; &nbsp; although I didn't have write permission
<br />&lt;Tom&gt; &nbsp; I remember writing a script that waited 5 minutes then changed someones background to solid black/white several times a second
<br />&lt;Tom&gt; &nbsp; we also added xhost + to some peoples .xinitrc and would pop up xeyes on their machine
<br />&lt;Tom&gt; &nbsp; or we'd ssh in and start a new X server running xlock so they'd come and sit down and discover we'd locked their machine
<br />&lt;Tom&gt; &nbsp; we also had the second xserver connect to the citrix metaframe
<br />&lt;Tom&gt; &nbsp; so they'd be typing away on their emacs and suddenly their machine would appear to be running windows and asking them to login
<br />&lt;Tom&gt; &nbsp; good times
