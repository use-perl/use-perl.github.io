<p><p>This is a neat and very simple use of features I just discovered in mutt.</p>

<p>By way of explanation (skip this if you know mutt well):</p>

<p>In mutt, there is a general notion of search patterns with a large variety of criteria; eg. the pattern &#8220;<code>~d &gt;10d</code>&#8221; will match mails whose date is more than 10 days in the past. You can use such patterns to search for mail, of course, but they&#8217;re also used for many other commands, eg. &#8220;<code>delete-pattern</code>&#8221; and &#8220;<code>tag-pattern</code>&#8221;.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tagging&#8221; a message is mutt&#8217;s concept of selecting it for some subsequent batch operation; f.ex., you can reply to several mails in a single message by tagging them and then doing &#8220;<code>tag-reply</code>&#8221;. You can tag mails individually by hitting &#8220;t&#8221;, en masse using &#8220;<code>tag-pattern</code>&#8221; (which is cumulative; it does not untag mails), or even tag the entire thread a mail belongs to.</p>

<p>Another command that uses search patterns is &#8220;<code>limit</code>&#8221;, which reduces the list of messages shown in a folder to a particular subset. Said subset is selected by a search pattern &#8211; that way you can limit the view to mails with a particular subject, or from a particular date, or the like.</p>

<p>Now here&#8217;s the punchline:</p>

<p>The &#8220;<code>limit</code>&#8221; command can only select mails based on a pattern. Say you have several short threads from coworkers in your inbox, pertaining to the same issue. And you are like me and don&#8217;t cope well with clutter, so you want every other mail out of your view. But trying to come up with a pattern for "`limit`" that matches all the mails about that issue while matching no other message would be cumbersome.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s an easy solution: the search pattern &#8220;<code>~T</code>&#8221; matches all tagged messages! So just tag the messages you&#8217;re interested in, then limit your view to the tagged mails. (Note that you can untag the messages after limiting the view; the search expression is only evaluated once.)</p>

<p>This is very very simple, but just proved tremendously useful. I managed to process a suddenly overflowing inbox with much less mental effort than it would otherwise have taken. I can already tell I&#8217;ll be using this feature combination <em>all the time</em> now that I thought of it.</p></p>
