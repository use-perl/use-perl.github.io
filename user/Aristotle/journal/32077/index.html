<blockquote cite="http://techdirt.com/articles/20070103/003127.shtml"><p>For all the talk about how iTunes is something of a <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20031107/1134211_F.shtml">loss leader</a> for Apple, it&#8217;s still never been clearly stated just how much the recording industry charges Apple for each downloaded song.  Everyone seems to agree that it&#8217;s approximately two-thirds of the retail $0.99 price, and at various times we&#8217;ve heard numbers as low as $0.65 and as high as $0.77.  The general consensus is that it&#8217;s usually in the $0.67 to $0.70 range, with $0.70 being the standard these days.  However, it appears that the RIAA really just doesn&#8217;t want anyone to know about them.  In one of the recent lawsuits, UMG v. Lindor, where the defendant is <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20061110/005745.shtml">challenging the damages amount</a>, the RIAA is <a href="http://recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com/2007/01/riaa-wants-wholesale-pricing_02.html">refusing to disclose the wholesale pricing details</a> unless they can require Lindor&#8217;s attorneys to keep the prices confidential.  Her attorneys refuse to do so, on the grounds that the information really isn&#8217;t confidential, and the only reason the RIAA is hoping to keep the prices quiet is to assist them in other lawsuits.  Perhaps that would be lawsuits like the one they&#8217;re facing from <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060428/036245.shtml">a bunch of musicians</a> who feel that the labels are cheating them out of revenues owed from digital downloads.</p></blockquote></p>

Dear Techdirt,<br><br>iTunes != iTunes Music Store.  Grrr.  My hope is that one day I will read articles in which the author actually knows the difference between the two.  Your first sentence should have read:<br><br>"For all the talk about how <b>the iTunes music store</b> is something of a loss leader for Apple..."<br><br>kthanksbye.
