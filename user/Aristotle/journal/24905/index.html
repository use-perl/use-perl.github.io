<p><p>I <a href="http://plasmasturm.org/log/161/" title="Shameless boasting">mentioned before</a> that a complete rewrite of a complex codebase is not a badge you should wear proudly on your vest Ã¢â¬â quite the opposite. If you need to be convinced, check out what <cite>Callum McKenzie</cite> <a href="http://spooky-possum.org/cgi-bin/pyblosxom.cgi/rewrites" title="Rewriting Software">reports from experience</a>:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://spooky-possum.org/cgi-bin/pyblosxom.cgi/rewrites">
<p>In hindsight the effort would have been better spent on incrementally changing the code-base. There was a lot of code that just didnÃ¢â¬â¢t need changing. Even the idea that a complete rewrite will get rid of all the design problems and half-baked patches isnÃ¢â¬â¢t correct: I still screwed up several parts of the design and there are still places where I did something because it was easy-to-write, not because it was the best way to do it. [Ã¢â¬Â¦]</p>
<p>The extra time spent levering new code and even new designs into existing code is far less than the time you spend rewriting all the code that still works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Be sure to read the entire post Ã¢â¬â the above is quoted a little selectively.)</p>

<p>This is not an Ã¢â¬ÅI told you so.Ã¢â¬Â I applaud him for consciously making this experiment on a medium complexity codebase to make a judgement, since he wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t already convinced, and for posting his results as a data point for me and you as well. Thanks, Callum.</p></p>
