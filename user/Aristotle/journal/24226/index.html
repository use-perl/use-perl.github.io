<p><p>Sometimes I worry about myself, when passages like this one from <a href="http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=printer_friendly&amp;pid=273&amp;page=1">A conversation with <cite>Alan Kay</cite></a> will invariably push my buttons:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=printer_friendly&amp;pid=273&amp;page=1"><p>I think a lot of the success of various programming languages is expeditious gap-filling. Perl is another example of filling a tiny, short-term need, and then being a real problem in the longer term.</p></blockquote>

<p>I shouldn&#8217;t be this emotionally attached.</p>

<p>Looking at the wider context of the conversation, he is talking about the historical view, and looking at earlier iterations of Perl, I have to admit that it was just not a very good language back in the time. Only since Perl5 can it be considered a solid language, and a lot of the problems we have with a massively crufty legacy Perl code bodies are caused either directly or indirectly by the Perl4 heritage.</p>

<p>Later, he goes to differentiate between agglutinative vs style languages. <cite>Stuart Feldman</cite>, who is interviewing him, says in summary that</p>

<blockquote cite="http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=printer_friendly&amp;pid=273&amp;page=1"><p>I would characterize style languages as those with a very rigorous kernel that describes them intellectually.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the culmination of a stretch in the discussion that touches, among others, on how Lisp and Smalltalk are defined extensively in terms of themselves.</p>

<p>Most certainly, in its sixth iteration, Perl is coming of age.</p>

<p>What I worry about is that if anything, Perl seems to accumulate <em>more</em> arcane syntax as it grows, however much symmetry goes along with it. For my sensitivities, examples of Perl6 code too frequently look like a bad pun on APL. I hope this is just curmudgeonly resistance to change, with no basis in real trouble.</p>

<p>On his closing point, Alan shows that he and Larry most likely do not disagree at all:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=printer_friendly&amp;pid=273&amp;page=1"><p>I could go on and on. I feel like my answers are quite trivial since nobody really knows how to design a good language, including me.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now that sounds familiar&#8230;</p></p>

<h2>The &quot;dead&quot; language</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2005-04-16T15:01:51</h3>
<p>I had a similar reaction when I told a friend that I specialized in Perl and she felt sorry for me for being stuck in a dying language.</p>

<p>Hey, you could do a lot worse than work in a dead language. FORTRAN is dead too, and so is COBOL&#8230;</p>

<p>Of course Perl is far from dead. You just wouldn&#8217;t realize it if you only look at the press.</p>
