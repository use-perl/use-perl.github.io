<blockquote cite="http://www.mail-archive.com/sqlite-users@sqlite.org/msg24372.html"><p>The problem with &#8220;public domain&#8221; (and this is something I did not know when I put SQLite in the public domain in 2001) is that some jurisdictions (ex: Germany) do not recognize the right of an author to dedicate a work to the public domain. I can say &#8220;this is in the public domain&#8221; all I want, but my words will not be legally binding in a German court, I&#8217;m told. The only way for me to get rid of the copyright on SQLite is to die, something I&#8217;m not planning to do in the near term.</p></blockquote></p>

Well, he's absolutely correct. That's the difference between Copyright and "Urheberrecht," you can't get rid of the latter. But of course you can hand out unlimited usage permissions.

<p>Which is what he does, as he goes on to write later.</p>

<p>I know about the philosophical difference between the laws &#8211; a literal translation of &#8220;Urheberrecht&#8221; would be something like &#8220;author&#8217;s right.&#8221; Contrast that with the literal meaning of the word &#8220;copyright&#8221; and you get the right idea: one is about innate rights associated with the creation of a work, the other is about rights over its replication. Obviously, you can&#8217;t sensibly declare that you are no longer the creator of something you created, whereas you can sensibly declare that you no longer wish to control its replication.</p>

<p>I just thought that his deadpan way of &#8220;declining&#8221; was funny.</p>

<h2>laws are funny like that</h2>

It's not just Germany: the concept of "public domain" is really a feature of U.S. copyright law.  Similar things exist in other jurisdictions, but not quite the same.<br>

<p>I know. The best option if you want to do something like that is to put things under MIT licence, which works the same way in pretty well every jurisdiction.</p>
