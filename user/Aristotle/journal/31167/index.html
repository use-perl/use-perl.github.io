<h2>Not so fast my friend...</h2>

<i>DISCLAIMER: IANAL</i> <p>

While I endorse its <i>spirit</i>, I'm afraid it suffers from the failings of many other such licenses, namely, <b>lack of indemnification</b>.</p><p>

If you've ever been through the process of getting business - esp. E&amp;O - insurance, you'll understand that indemnification is pretty important. Which is why some licenses have been updated recently (e.g.,
Apache 2.0) to indeminify. Sure, it won't stop you from getting sued, but it makes harder for the plaintiff to get very far unless they can prove malicious intent.</p><p>

A simple indemnification clause is pretty simple to cut&amp;paste. Too bad WTFPL didn't take the time to add that as item (1). Changing names does <b>not</b> protect the innocent.</p><p>

This issue is also a sore point for me wrt the Artistic license, which does a poor job of clearly stating indemnification. Whenever possible/appropriate, I've found the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/afl-3.0.php" title="opensource.org">AFL</a opensource.org>
accomplishes what I intend (i.e., "do what the f*ck you want, but I'M NOT LIABLE")</p>

<p>I agree, but the AFL falls short on a count at which the WFTPL is unbeatable: brevity and simplicity.</p>

<p>Personally, my ideal licence (for works I am not significantly invested in; GPL otherwise) would state the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do not claim the work is yours.</li>
<li>Do with it whatever you want.</li>
<li>Don&#x2019;t blame me.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is very close to the MIT licence, except there is no copyright notice obligation. You may just not claim you wrote it.</p>

<p>Not allowed to claim you wrote the software doesn't prevent my brother from claiming I wrote it.
</p><p>I prefer to use MIT, with releasing it into the public domain as a close second. I seriously dislike the GPL.</p>

<p>Good catch on the loophole, but I wasn&#x2019;t drafting licence text &#x2013; merely outlining the statements. One would hope that a lawyer would catch that, and I would never write an actual licence without having a lawyer look at it.</p>

<p>I does not surprise me that you dislike the GPL. Frankly, I would have been surprised if you didn&#x2019;t. I think copyleft has its place, though. (Just like non-free software does.) The MIT licence is what I use as well when I don&#x2019;t care about copyleft (ie. in most cases).</p>

<p>Don&#x2019;t put things in the public domain. Many jurisdictions do not have such a legal construct (German law, f.ex.), so putting things in the public domain will make them harder to use for some of your audience than if you retained copyright.</p>

<h2>WTFPL is discriminatory!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/DAxelrod/">DAxelrod</a> on 2006-10-01T17:55:31</h3>
Another problem the WTFPL has is that it discriminates against certain groups and fields of endevor.<br><br>Anyone who has taken a vow of celibacy will have trouble doing anything involving 'fuck'ing, even if the word is only used as an adjective.<br><br>Also, it discriminates against those who have no free will and do not want anything.<br><br>Additionally, the use of the word "just" prevents people from doing things they don't want to do.
