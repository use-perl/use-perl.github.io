<p><p>Now that I figured out how to integrate <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> into my browsing habits (browser bookmarks will serve only to keep frequently used links on hand, as well as for temporary bookmarking; stuff to file goes on del.icio.us), I dive into my old bookmarks every so often to sort out what still works and what I really want to keep. Then I file those on del.icio.us, which works much better than the never-satisfactory hierarchies I used to try to keep things in, and delete the local bookmarks.</p>

<p>Before, I hadnÃ¢â¬â¢t quite realised how old some of these links were. My bookmarks have been travelling alongside my computer life basically ever since IÃ¢â¬â¢ve had internet access. I donÃ¢â¬â¢t know if the bookmarks file I have now is still a continuation of my very first one from <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> 3.0; but itÃ¢â¬â¢s definitely a continuation of my bookmarks from the time of <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> 5.0. Ever since, I have been importing my bookmarks over to each browser I used; into every new version; across operating systems. (Similarly, my home directory goes back to my first successful Linux install, and I still have most mail I ever sent or got and all the <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> and messenger logs going years back.)</p>

<p>The last round of bookmark diving went into my funnies folder. Of about 30 links, less than half were dead; of those, more than a third could be found again with a quick Google search. All in all, 7 or 8 links were lost. Of the others, I discarded about as many. This is somewhat surprising if you consider that several of those links go back as far as 1999.</p>

<p>ButÃ¢â¬Â¦ <em>memories</em>. Goodness, the memories. I got rather sentimental a couple of timesÃ¢â¬Â¦ good grief, did time ever fly. I was younger then, less tired, more naÃÂ¯ve. I donÃ¢â¬â¢t know that the time has gone by well. It made me feel pretty old to unearth these remnants from the past.</p>

<p>I need to live more.</p></p>

<h2>Local Bookmarks</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vek/">vek</a> on 2006-01-08T08:55:36</h3>
Yeah I do the same thing by having the 5 or 6 sites I visit daily in my Firefox bookmarks toolbar (Gmail, Bloglines, Perlmonks, Google News etc).  Everything else is stored in del.icio.us.<br><br>Of course, I don't have to actually visit del.icio.us manually to find bookmarks, I use the <a href="http://dietrich.ganx4.com/foxylicious/" title="ganx4.com">foxylicious</a ganx4.com> extension to sync all my del.icio.us bookmarks to my local browser bookmarks.
