<p><p>Today&#8217;s that day again, like every year: outrageous stuff on every blog, from every blogger. They think it&#8217;s in the spirit of a prank.</p>

<p>Well no, it&#8217;s not.</p>

<p>To announce outrageous stuff that&#8217;s obvious right away is <em>not</em> a prank. Your jokes ain&#8217;t funny, people. They&#8217;re stale and stupid and fool noone but yourselves. My feed reader is brimming with the aborted creativity of the thousand bland attempts at witty lies. There are some good ones deep in there, but those are few and far between. So cut it out &#8211; if you&#8217;re not clever, stay away. You do not <em>have</em> to make up something to be cool.</p>

<p>&#8217;Tis better to be thought a fool&#8230;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: verdict for the year: big ups to Ovid, and an honorary mention for Thomas Klausner. Everyone else: try harder or try not to, next time.</p></p>

<p>You know, his actually caught me out for a moment.  I rushed over to the CPANTS site and started looking around, confused as to what the hell he was doing.  Then I felt very, very foolish<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I realised sooner than that that he was joking, but I did go &#8220;ah-huh&#8221; for a moment before I caught it. If he had picked subtler metric names we would&#8217;ve had me. With yours, I didn&#8217;t even realise before I saw the comments. You really had me.</p>

<p>I'm just kicking myself that I hadn't remembered to screen all comments instead of just my default of anonymous ones.</p>

<p>You <em>can</em> manually screen comments, <em>and</em> you can retrospectively change the post&#8217;s settings, y&#8217;know&#8230; but that&#8217;s water under the bridge now.</p>
