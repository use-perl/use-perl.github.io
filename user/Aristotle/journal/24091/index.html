<h1>CPAN Ratings: the social failings of a useful system</h1>

</div> <!-- /span4 -->


<div class="span8">
<p><p>My personal overall opinion is that <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/">CPAN Ratings</a> has been a mild success. Key to its usefulness is that all these reviews, noise or signal, are easily reachable directly from the CPAN search itself. This close association makes it better equipped to be relevant than any other venue we currently have.</p>

<p>Of course, most reviews are just about useless and donÃ¢â¬â¢t manage to tell you more than that the author thinks Ã¢â¬Åthis module is great!Ã¢â¬Â This is no surprise; reviewing well requires empathy, which is a talent few people have; particularly relating to an audience. Reviews which show that the reviewer has put the module through its paces or at least taken an in-depth glance at it, however short, are relatively few and far between. Still, their absolute number is high enough for the system to be useful, in my opinion. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve spent quite a bit of my own time trying to write <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/a/5084">reviews I hope are useful</a>, in hopes of contributing positively to the system.</p>

<p>What really annoys me are the cases of which <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/d/CGI-okTemplate">this one</a> or <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/d/DBD-Pg">that</a> are only the latest examples: people use the rating system to write bug reports or to respond to a review. <em>These things are not reviews!</em> They donÃ¢â¬â¢t belong where they are posted.</p>

<p>With bug reports, the case is clear: they belong on <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/">RT</a>, not on <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/">CPAN Ratings</a>. One might argue that grave bugs might warrant a rating (and thus review) all by themselves, but then how many people are there who will actually go back once the bug has been fixed and amend or retract such a Ã¢â¬Åbug review?Ã¢â¬Â Better to keep these things were they belong. LetÃ¢â¬â¢s not forget that someone who checks the ratings can easily take a look at the bug tracker as well.</p>

<p>With commentary on reviews, the case gets murkier. <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/">CPAN Ratings</a> does not provide a way to contact the author of a review nor does it offer a way to comment on a review. WhatÃ¢â¬â¢s worse is that the lack of a discussion platform is compounded by the abuse as a bug reporting system. I do not have a link handy, but IÃ¢â¬â¢ve seen authors respond to bug reports on the rating system byÃ¢â¬Â¦ writing a post on the rating system. Frankly, I have no good ideas on how to solve this problem. The most practical approach (note: not solution) might be to allow posting Ã¢â¬ÅreviewsÃ¢â¬Â which carry no rating so that they can be used for responses and comments. Still, the rating system is not a discussion forum (and in my opinion, rightly so), so the format will always be ill-suited to discussion.</p>

<p>And of course, the question which remains is: how do we get people to direct comments (even if we knew where those should go) and bug reports to their respective, correct venues?</p></p>

<h2>Mhm...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sri/">sri</a> on 2005-04-09T19:11:49</h3>
I absolutely agree.<br/><br/>Worst thing happening to me so far are bad reviews from people who don't even understand what that module in question does...wish i could at least comment.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(



<h2>A Commenting System</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Shlomi Fish/">Shlomi Fish</a> on 2005-04-09T19:45:12</h3>
<p>
Maybe one should construct a commenting system for the reviews. I.e: be able to comment on the review and hold a discussion about it. Either a nested discussion, but it's possible a flat one will also do.
</p>
<p>
This will resolve most of the problems with the current system. Gabor Szabo has already implemented CPAN-Forum, so one way would be to post the review on this module forum, and place a link from the review in cpanratings to ths discussion in the forum, with a text of "comment".

<h2>Bug report redirection</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/schwern/">schwern</a> on 2005-04-10T22:01:59</h3>
<blockquote><div> <tt>how do we get people to direct comments (even if we knew where those should go) and bug reports to their respective, correct venues?</tt> </div></blockquote>How about some review guidelines just above the "Review" box?  Such as:<br> <br>"Do not use this to report bugs, it is likely the author will never see it and it won't get fixed.  Please report bugs via [link to the distribution's rt queue]."<br> <br>Ironically, use.perl is not the bug report forum for cpanratings.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  I'll mention this thread to Ask so he sees it.<br> <br>While I'm at it:<br> <br>"Think before you give a module a 1.  Is it really that bad?"  (Prompted by the recent IO::All rating).<br> <br>"1 means...  2 means...  3 means..."  For example, I'm the sort of person who rarely gives anything the highest rating because I think that should be reserved for exceptional cases.  Other people ONLY use 1 and 5.  "I hate it" or "I like it".<br> <br>Also it would help a separate rating to describe the level of bugginess encountered might be helpful.<br> <br>Finally, some option for authors to ask that ratings be emailed to them as they come in so that its push not pull.<br>

<p>Hey, thanks for the comments. I am aware that this is not the bugreport forum for cpanratings<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:)</tt> (though I&#8217;m not sure what <em>is</em>), but I wasn&#8217;t reporting bugs so much as hoping to kick off a bit of discussion. (Maybe I should post to Perlmonks as well.)</p>

<p>Some explanatory text would certainly help. It won&#8217;t suffice, I think, but it sure would be an improvement over the current situation. Having ratings mailed to authors is a good suggestion, but I&#8217;m not sure how it relates to my points; was it supposed to, did I miss something?</p>

<p>As for the ratings: basically, to me, 1 means &#8220;I recommend against using this&#8221; and 5 means &#8220;I can recommend this module to anyone in good conscience.&#8221; The intermediate ratings obviously signify recommendations with varying degrees of caveats.</p>

<p>Do you have any suggestions on the general &#8220;talking back&#8221; issue? I think that is the most important to address, and it won&#8217;t easily be helped by a bit of explanatory text or such either.</p>

If nothing else it means the authors might actually read the ratings and consider them.  It also means that should someone report a bug via CPAN ratings the author will see it.</p><blockquote><div> <tt>As for the ratings: basically, to me, 1 means...</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>Which is the whole point.  Rating numbers mean different things to different people.  One needs to assign a standard meaning to each number.  Or better yet, eliminate the discrete numbers entirely and just use a slider with descriptions of what each range on the slider means.</p><blockquote><div> <tt>Do you have any suggestions on the general &#8220;talking back&#8221; issue?

Its best way to guarantee the author, any author, will get your message.

</p><p>rt.cpan.org works for bugs as it emails the author.

</p><p>The rest don't push content back to the author so they're unreliable.  Maybe the author reads it, maybe they don't.  This includes cpanratings and the new <a href="http://www.cpanforum.com/" title="cpanforum.com">CPAN Forum</a cpanforum.com>.  CPAN Forum has some support for message push but you can't say "push me content about all my modules" you have to sign up for each one individually and I'm not about to bother for 50+ modules.  Its also opt-in and most module authors don't even know it exists.

</p><p>So the problem common to most existing ways to bitch about modules is that the people who can do something about it, the author, likely never sees it.  I don't read Perlmonks.  Every once in a while I sweep it for people reporting bugs about my modules and throw up another "talk to the author, damnit!" rant but that's work.  If any feedback system is going to work it has to:

</p><ul>
<li>A: Push content back to the author.</li>
<li>B: Be opt-out, not opt-in.</li>
<li>C: Carefully manage the volume so as not to annoy the author.</li>
</ul>

<p>rt.cpan.org and user@cpan.org succeeded in this despite many authors howling that they didn't want it imposed on them and never wanted to hear about it.  An opt-out option for rt.cpan.org was proposed for those who objected the loudest but I don't think it was ever implmented as, in the end, it turned out to be a great thing for all.</p>

<blockquote><div> <p>Speaking of places where bugs are reported which never get back to the author.</p> </div></blockquote>

<p>Uh, I did say that the intent was to get some discussion going to exchange ideas maybe, not to report a bug. The issues I brought up are no bugs; see also the title I chose.</p>

<blockquote><div> <p>Just about every author has an user@cpan.org address. Its best way to guarantee the author, any author, will get your message.</p> </div></blockquote>

<p>I agree, but that isn&#8217;t the direction I was talking about. I was wondering how the author (or someone else) could respond <em>to a review(er)</em>, because that is what currently goes wrong in the system. The reviews seem to reach authors just fine in many cases: several authors have reacted to my reviews, one of them even had the sense to search long enough to find my email address. It won&#8217;t hurt to make this more convenient for authors too, of course, but that's not the pressing issue.</p>

<p>As for bugs, yes, I had already mentioned that they shouldn&#8217;t be reported on cpanratings in the first place.</p>

</p> <ol>
<li>  Push the reviews to the author.
</li> <li>  Let the author publish his response to the review on cpanratings (by simply replying to the review email sent out by cpanratings)
</li> <li>  Allow the reviewer to retract his review if the author has satisfied his problem or if a later version of the module changes his view.  Make these edits/retractions visible so people can see the author is responsive, a point of review itself.
</li> </ol>

<p>Ah! Of course. Noone but the author really needs to respond to a review. Good thinking. I&#146;ll add one minor point: an author should not be able to post &#147;self-reviews.&#148;</p>

<p>I think together with the stuff I wrote in reply to Ask that makes a cohesive set of proposed changes to mitigate the problems we currently see. I&#146;ll summarize these in an email to him and see if I can lend a hand with the implementation.</p>

1. Patches welcome.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  There's a <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/about.html" title="perl.org">todo list</a perl.org>.<br> <br>2. The "was this helpful?" feature would solve some of these issues, I think.<br> <br>3. It was a concious choice not to allow comments on reviews.  I didn't and don't want it to turn into a discussion forum.  I understand the problem of it going that way anyway sometimes, but I'd rather not encourage it.<br> <br>

<p>Hey, thanks for dropping by.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I&#8217;ll see about how to be more useful (and where I can squeeze this into my crowded headspace (finding time is not really an issue)). As I said, mostly I wanted to stir up some talk, because I can see this issues but I&#8217;m not bright enough to have solutions.</p>

<p>I suppose &#8220;was this helpful?&#8221; is already on the todo list as &#8220;Helpfulness ratings&#8221;? That sounds like a good idea, yes. I thought of a meta/moderation system, but I&#8217;m unsure if the place gets enough traffic to sustain such. OTOH it can&#8217;t hurt in any case. I was pretty sure comments were consciously decided against, and I agree that it is the right choice in this case. I&#8217;m just wondering what could possibly be done in order to keep &#8220;discussion ratings&#8221; out of the place, because goodness knows it is ill-suited and ill-chosen for that purpose.</p>

<p>After some thinking, how about the following suggestions?</p>

<ol>
<li> <p>The &#8220;add review&#8221; link would be removed and only the distro page on <tt>search.cpan.org</tt> would have a link for writing reviews. You can still write a review from the ratings page, but it would take a roundtrip through the distro page. The intent is to associate writing a review with the distribution rather than with the ratings, and to discourage the reflex to &#8220;reply&#8221; to a rating.</p> </li>
<li> <p>There would be some kind of &#8220;respond&#8221; link which either sends mail to the rating author or leaves a private message to him somewhere in the system (the latter option requires extra infrastructure of course).</p> </li>
</ol>

<p>The idea is that moving these links around this way would act as &#8220;syntactic salt&#8221; for doing the wrong thing, while funnelling people towards other venues. How do these sound?</p>
