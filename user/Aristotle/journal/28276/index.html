<p><p>Apparently, itÃ¢â¬â¢s surprisingly wacky to Google your <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&q=%22unfortunately+aristotle%22">first name, prepending Ã¢â¬ÅunfortunatelyÃ¢â¬Â</a>:</p>

<li><q cite="http://www.abc.net.au/programsales/s1175905.htm">Unfortunately, AristotleÃ¢â¬â¢s ideas were quite useless when it came to firing cannons accurately.</q></li>
<li><q cite="http://www.chilit.org/QUATT4.htm">Unfortunately Aristotle didnÃ¢â¬â¢t also warn me of another bit of wisdom that I later learned in the school of hard knocks.</q></li>

<p>The joys of having an extravagant first nameÃ¢â¬Â¦</p>

<li>Unfortunately, Abigail Fillmore, an intelligent and educated woman, is one of
our Nation&#8217;s most obscure First Ladies.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, Abigail's aunt has not kept her store up to the standards required
by the Selwyn Avenue Antique Dealers Association</li>

<li>Unfortunately, Abigail lives south of Houston, so my wife and I don't get down
there very much.</li>
<li>Unfortunately Abigail is also a suspect, and EZ refuses to make the same mistake
about a woman again.</li>
<li>Unfortunately Abigail died shortly after the union, but Abner gained five more
friends when the consortium went on another dive trip in March of 2000<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</li>
<li>Unfortunately, Abigail died after giving birth to three of Samuel's children, and
Samuel moved to Macon County, North Carolina, and married Mary GUFFEY</li>
<li>Unfortunately Abigail, I have absolutely no idea what I did anymore.</li>

And it's all true!

I'm not sure I want to know the context of this one, and I'm certainly not going to admit any truth to it...

Unfortunately, Bluto then accidentally eats some himself and thinks Olive is a calf who needs branding.</p>

Good one!<br><br>Unfortunately, "Sidhekin" was not found prepended by "unfortunately" (hey, will this be indexed?), so I had to use my real name.  The best two:<br><br>Unfortunately, Eirik never reached the Holy Land; he fell ill of a fever and died in Cyprus, [...]<br><br>Unfortunately Eirik doesn't come here... only Erlend, which seems A bit logical because this place is all about Erlend.
