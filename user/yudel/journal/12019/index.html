<p>It seems that the new <a href="http://www.tpj.com">Perl Journal</a> is out.
<p>Current contents include:
<ul>
<li>Web Localization & Perl --
Autrijus Tang

<li>Data Manipulation & Perl Command-Line Options --
Andy Lester

<li>Google and Perl --
brian d foy

<li>Tracking Finances with WWW::Mechanize and HTML::Parser --
Simon Cozens

<li>HTML Filtering in Perl, Part 1 --
Randal Schwartz
</ul>

This seems like an opportune time to note that the new Perl Journal, while perhaps not as wonderful as Jon Orwant's version, has been well worth the $1/issue. 
<p>
Outstanding articles include April's piece on user mouse tracking with javascript and Perl, which shows how you can run your own usability testing to see how your web site's users move around on your site; and the various Simon Cozen pieces. Randal has apparently moved his Web Techniques column over to the TPJ

<h2>&quot;moving&quot; my column?</h2>

<blockquote><div> <i>Randal has apparently moved his Web Techniques column over to the TPJ.</i> </div></blockquote>
Huh?
<p>
I haven't done WT in over a year.  I don't consider having one magazine quit production, and then me being approached by an entirely different magazine a year later to be a "move".
</p><p>
The topics for my e-TPJ column will be general Perl topics.  It just happened that I was working on a web thingy at the time the column was due, hence the subject matter.
</p><p>
And in the meanwhile, I was still doing my <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/UnixReview/" title="stonehenge.com">Sys Admin</a stonehenge.com> (general intro topics) and <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/" title="stonehenge.com">Linux magazine</a stonehenge.com> (advanced topics) columns.  So it's not like I had much of a break!
</p><p>
If anything, the format of my e-TPJ column will be somewhat indistinguishable from the LinuxMag column, except that I don't dare talk about the coolness of my OpenBSD server or MacOS X laptop in Linux Magazine. {grin}</p>



<h2>Mouse tracking</h2>

I must say, I'm really pleased you enjoyed the article (Usability with Perl), and that the response overall has been positive for it - I was worried people would think it wasn't technical enough, and that the code sucked...
