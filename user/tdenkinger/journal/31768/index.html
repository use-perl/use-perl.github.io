<p>So, my current employer is making it clear my business unit will soon be dissolved.  Apparently advertising-based internet operations are <em> 	&agrave; la mode</em>, and having actual paying subscribers to a decent service is pass&eacute;.
So not too long ago I interviewed at Amazon.  After two technical phone interviews, I was brought to Seattle for a day of in-person interviews.  
<p>
<p>
Things went generally pretty well, though I didn't get an offer.  One of the interview sessions stands out as particularly bad, and I'm sure that had a big impact on their decision.  
<p>
The interviewer asked me to write a function that would turn a number into words.  The upper bounds for the exercise was 100,000,000,000.  So, 1,025 should become "one thousand twenty-five".  I was told to use any "first tier" language, "C, C++, Java".  He agreed that Perl would be fine too.
<p>
When I look at this exercise, I see a word problem, not a number problem.  Divide the number up into three character chunks (with a possible element less than three characters) and turn that into words.  It's basically "commify" with a twist.
<p>
So, I set about writing a little code on the whiteboard.  First, I reversed the string (the number) and started iterating over it pulling out chunks with a substr().  My goal was to get the three char chunks into an array.  I know there are better ways to do this, but under stress I took the route I thought of first.
<p>
I was stopped by the interviewer almost immediately and was asked why I was treating the number as a string.  For a moment the question didn't even make sense to me.  Had I been thinking clearly and not been confused, I might have asked him why it <em>shouldn't</em> be treated as a string.  Mostly I just stammered and blew the rest of the interview.
<p>
The solution he was looking for used "% 1000" to get the chunk followed by "/ 1000" to set the number up for the next call to the modulus.  It's possible I would never have gotten to that solution without prodding from the interviewer.
<p>
The whole experience was humbling, but not terrible.  I learned a bit about Huffman coding from another interviewer and implementing database-based linked lists from another.
<p>
I also got really good insight into some interviewing techniques that maybe I'll be able to use sometime.</p>

When I was a junior admin, I was sent on an interview to UUNET. I thought cool. I walked into the room with 5 senior UUNET admins. It was not fun to say the least. I doubted my very existence after that one.
