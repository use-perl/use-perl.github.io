<div class="span8">
<p>I came into work this morning with my very postive hat on.  I decided that instead of using Powerpoint to write some UNIX tools training slides that I have been asked to write.  I would try and embrass the funky sounding XML::Handler::AxPoint perl module.  This only catch was that I was going to try to get it working on Windows.
<p>Oh dear.  After downloading all the prereqs I naively thought my job was done but I found that I could not get Text::Iconv to compile in Cygwin or in native Windows.  Nobody else in the world seems to have this problem and indeed nobody else seems to have tried this on a Windows machine.  Maybe I will try on a Linux server later but I probably ought to write the presentation first....</p>

I suspect the problem with Text::Iconv was having the iconv libraries installed - I got beyond that point.  My problem now is that PDFLib requires pdflib_pl.pm which bootstrams a library when you compile pdflib lite.  The problem is it only builds statically on Cygwin and bootstrap wants a<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.dll<br> <br>Anyways - if you have any insights they would be most appreciated (yes, I realize how old this post is)<br> <br>Cheers<br>L~R
