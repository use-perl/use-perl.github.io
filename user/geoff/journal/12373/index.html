<div class="span8">
<p>one of the main goals I had set for myself before I started writing the book was that it <i>would</i> have an API for Digest authentication.  to refresh your memory, while Apache (and mod_perl) had interfaces for plugging Basic authentication into any verification mechanism you want (via $r->note_basic_auth_failure() and so on), nothing yet existed for Digest authentication... and I wanted one, so I wrote one.<br><br>
The API, in its latest form, is now <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/geoff/Apache-AuthDigest-0.022/">on CPAN</a> (and apparently people are actually using it).  however, <code>Apache::AuthDigest</code> is still somewhat lacking - it implements Digest auth patterned after the older mod_digest implementation, and isn't fully RFC compliant.  this is not a big deal to Opera, Mozilla, and other browsers but causes problems with (you guessed it) MSIE (of course, MSIE isn't RFC compliant either...).<br><br>
now, I had planned on writing all the Perl to make Digest auth proper (mostly by stealing from <code>LWP</code>), but I thought that Apache 2.0/mod_perl 2.0 might offer a better solution.  well, I was (almost) right - the experimental, Apache 2.1 branch provides a set of new authentication hooks, free for the taking.  so, after a few hours of dedicated snooping and coding, there is now <a href="http://www.modperlcookbook.org/user/geoff/modules/Apache-AuthenHook-2.00_01.tar.gz"><code>Apache::AuthenHook</code></a>  - the coolest thing I think I have ever done.  authentication, both Basic and Digest, have <i>never</i> been so easy.<br><br>
with open source, most days are ok, some days make you want to quit, and some days you feel like you've actually accomplished something meaningful.  now, all I have to do is find somebody who's interested in hiring me to do this stuff for real :)<br><br>
<i>coming soon to CPAN and a perl.com article near you...</i></p>
