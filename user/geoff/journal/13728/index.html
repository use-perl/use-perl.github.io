<p>well, I'm back from a three week hiatus - one at OSCon and two at <a href="http://www.ocnjonline.com/">the beach</a> with my family.  catching up on three weeks of email isn't easy.<br><br><br/><br/>the cool thing is that I don't return to the same old job.  as some of you may have heard at OSCon, I'm now a full-time employee of <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/">Ticketmaster</a>, charged with helping mod_perl 2.0 along, porting important CPAN modules to 2.0, helping with their internal migration to 2.0 eventually, etc.  while in the past I have only been able to work on mod_perl during my spare time, I'm now able to dedicate myself to it (well, in some sense I've been dedicated to it all along :).  looks like that long list of patches I've been working on/have in mind will come to fruition sooner than I thought :)<br><br><br/><br/>the first order of business (besides catching up on email) is to get my home office situated.  as it turns out, I no longer have a real development environment, so until the corporate laptop arrives I need to whip something together here.  I have an old pentium 120 (with 32MB RAM) that served as my firewall (which cost $3600 at the time and which was replaced by a $30 wireless router this morning), but that takes about 137 minutes to compile mod_perl so I need something with a bit more umph.  I also have to set up the $700 worth of gear I just bought (printer, wireless, cd burner, etc) to make the office workable, not to mention clearing out the junk that had accumulated while I was writing but never got cleaned up, install a door (and the office doubles as a guest bedroom, so yup, a bedroom without a door), and whatnot.  but I'll soon get all that in order and start being productive.  whee!<br><br>
so, watch this space for mod_perl activity.  and thank you, thank you, Ticketmaster...</p>

If you and Cindy are not all happy and tan, I'm going to be very disappointed.  Then again, you have two kids...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

It's good to hear that mod_perl 2 will be moving along all the faster.  I've been playing with apache 2 / mod_perl 2 and it's a lot of fun!

<p>I was happy to hear about this at OSCON.</p>
<p>Just remember, the pressure is on for you to forge the path for everyone who wants to telecommute. Feel the pressure!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>Oh, and care to elaborate on the bedroom with no door? How did that work out?</p>

<h3><a href="/user/geoff/">geoff</a> on 2003-07-30T01:32:29</h3>
yeah.  the design of our house sucks - it's a split level with 4 floors.  the spare bedroom is on the fourth floor with the entry in the main hallway.  we took the door down because if it was open we couldn't get to the bathroom and if it was closed the bedroom was sufficiently isolated that it got all hot and muggy (no central air up there).<br> <br><br/><br/>so, I tore down the wall and am (gradually) installing a pocket door where the hinge door used to be.  of course, there is so little room that the pocket door, when stowed, will slide behind the linnen closet and prevent access to the towells, but that's no biggie<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br><br/><br/>pictures soon<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>Congratulations, and kudos to Ticketmaster for funding development like this!  I'd like to read more about how they feel they benefit from mod_perl, if there's anything online.</p>
