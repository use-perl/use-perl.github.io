<p>I think I get geeked out at these things far too fast - monday I couldn't really get into the flow of things and decided to spend the day lounging around instead of going to talks.  of course, it didn't help that, in my wandering, I found the typical cast of mod_perl related characters had the same idea and were drinking at the bar all day.<br><br>
monday night we again headed out to dinner with essentially the same crew (joined by Robert Spier, Ask, and Vivek Khera, minus the Sergeants).  After describing his new house the night before, Tim showed us pictures of his new home on the coast of Ireland (and his beautiful daughter), which made me instantly want to move away from my little slice of suburbia.<br><br><br/><br/>what was really nice about the evening, though, was that we geeks spent and entire evening together and it was rare to find us talking about technical things - we had fun talking about our children, our homes, and other things that were common and interesting to us all.</p>
