<div class="span8">
<p>I was in a meeting yesterday where a seasoned but non-technical person was surprised that the project at hand involved a substantial amount of re-coding.  "I thought it was just..." the sentence began, which then continued (in my mind) as "completely re-thinking $concept and normalizing $concept data across 38 new tables instead of the current 5" but sounded like "switching around a few tables" to everyone else.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I've worked with lots of non-technical folks over the years, some good, many bad, and this person is one of the good ones, so I found it amusing rather than irksome.  but, for the record...<br/><br/><br/><br/>there is no such thing as "it's just..." in software engineering anymore.  at least not for mature applications with an established userbase where real money is involved.</p>

<h2>&quot;Can't we just...&quot;</h2>

<p>Another variation on this is "Can't we just...".  Whenever I hear that, I know trouble's a comin' and it is time to head for them thar hills<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>



<h2>Truth</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Lecar_red/">Lecar_red</a> on 2007-12-21T21:09:31</h3>
I've found that the worse offenders are managers/product people that coded years ago... Just a bit of knowledge is dangerous<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>one sentence</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/link/">link</a> on 2007-12-21T23:08:29</h3>
Every project can be reduced to one sentence which may or may not underestimate the underlying complexity of the project.

<p>"It's just a logo modification, plus some color tweaks."</p>

<p>"It's just a little course change in our business strategy."</p>

<p>"It's only small update to our target markets."</p>
