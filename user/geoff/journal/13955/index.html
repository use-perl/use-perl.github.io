<p>wireless on linux truly sucks.  I spent half of last night and most of the morning trying to get my new SMC card to work with RH9 on my new thinkpad.  after hours and hours of reading every howto and google match possible, and endless driver compliations, still no wireless.<br><br>
hmph.</p>

<p>I never managed to intall a wireless card on Windows. OK, I just tried twice, and not very hard. And I don't know anything about Windows. But I still managed to get my neighbour to get yelled at by his IT guys for totally trashing the network setup on his laptop<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;--).</p>
<p>OTOH I got the same wireless card (linksys) running in about 5 minutes on my Linux laptop...</p>

well, I had no problem using the card on a win2000 laptop, but linux is still eluding me.  perhaps it's because the card is fairly new and I don't see any progress on the drivers over the past year.<br> <br>
I guess it's time to look for a supported card (though the $9.99 cost of this one was hard to turn down)

<h2>Linux OK for me</h2>

I'm with Mirod on this. Every time I have to install something for windows I end up endlessly faffing around looking for driver disks. This is especially a nightmare for one of my laptops - no disk drive, no CD drive, no ethernet. The only way to get things onto it is either via a PCMCIA network card, or plug in the CD drive (which goes in the PCMCIA card slot). Needless to say this ends up being NOT FUN.<br> <br>Linux on that same laptop worked like a charm, and when I pushed my two different wireless cards into the PCMCIA slot, they were detected and instantly on. No configuration required.<br> <br>But then Linux always has had problems with one-day old hardware. Buy a card from a well known manufacturer if you want it to work well on Linux - but I guess you don't need me to tell you that now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

bah, if only I could have such luck<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<br> <br>
the problem with new hardware is that is pretty much all that's sold around here.  hmph.

Full plug and play on my Debian systems. But then, I don't use $9.99 WiFi cards, and a sane distribution (although RH9 apparently does have good WiFi support)<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>And that was two years ago. I bought two Orinoco PCMCIA cards and after installing Debian on my laptop (during Takeover 2001, a demo scene party) it immediately recognised the card, which found the access point automatically. The box requested an IP through DHCP and got one. Didn't have to install anything non-standard and didn't have to change any configuration.
