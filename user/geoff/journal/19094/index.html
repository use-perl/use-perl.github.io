<p>it looks like my <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2004/view/e_sess/5082">OSCon tutorial</a> is in danger of being cancelled due to not meeting the minimum number of registered attendees.  It's really a shame, since not only is it probably one of the better introductions to using the Apache API (in Perl, aka mod_perl), but I'm upheaving it to include both mod_perl 1.0 and 2.0 examples as we speak.<br><br><br/><br/>so, if you have any interest in mod_perl, how it interacts with Apache, mod_perl 2.0, or similar topic, now is the time to sign up :)<br><br><br/><br/>according to past attendees of this same talk, I'm also <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/ka6wke/journal/6613">a decent speaker</a>, and I <a href="http://rjbs.manxome.org/bryar/bryar.cgi/id_journal:161">bring snacks</a>, so you won't be disappointed.</p>

That doesn't bode well for my hour-long talk on roughly the same subject in the Apache track during the conference.
<p>
Or maybe, people are opting to go to my free talk instead of your paid talk.  That would suck.  Sorry.</p>

I would totally go to this, except that, well, my tutorial is scheduled at the exact same time.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(<br> <br>(Also, I don't think speaker attendees really count.)

Portland has the highest micro brewery per capita ratio in the US.<br> <br>I stayed in Portland for a few days after last year's OSCon and now I've got a list of all the cool bars.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>If you'd <em>really</em> experienced Portland microbreweries, you wouldn't remember making a list.</p>

<p>If only we knew a Portland native to show us how to <i>really</i> experience Portland microbreweries...</p>

<p>I don't remember making a list, but that's because I didn't do the research!  I could probably round up an Ovid or a jZed, though.</p>
