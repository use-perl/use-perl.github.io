<p>it's good to be back at YAPC this year.  I don't really have the dedication to summarize it all, so here are a few random thoughts...<br><br><br/><br/><ul>
<li>like testing in previous years, this year there is a large emphasis on perl as a craft - if you consider software development as your art then you will be a good developer, and when you are a good developer "you can't write maintainable PERL" arguments diminish.</li>
<li>I am entirely convinced that unicode operators as language tokens is a bad idea.  but I am but a peon in this brave new world.</li>
<li>I need to see how Perl 6 expects to handle namespaces and how that relates to testing.  I really, really like being able to temporarily override subroutines in my tests so I can make them fail.  in fact, I am increasingly convinced that languages without that feature can never create code as robust as very well tested Perl.  anyway, one thing I only half-heard in Damian's Perl 6 talk makes me think Perl 6 will not have that ability, which is unfortunate (if true).</li>
<li>that I can use <code>assbackwards</code> legitimately in a technial talk has apparently lost its humor.</li>
<li>while having friends that live all across the world is fantastic, only having a few hours of real conversation a year with these really extrodinary people is somewhat depressing.</li>
<li>the wings in Buffalo are very, very good.</li>
</ul><br/><br/>oh, and for the archives, <a href="http://mailman.linux-thinkpad.org/pipermail/linux-thinkpad/2004-April/017432.html">this link</a> saved me (additional) hours of frustration.  so, if you have a thinkpad and are having problems getting X to play nice with a projector, check it out.</p>
