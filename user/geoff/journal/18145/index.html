<p>I've been having hard drive troubles on my IBM thinkpad lately, so I tried wiping it clean with some IBM tools and reinstalling everything from scratch.  since I was starting anew, I thought I would install fedora instead of redhat...<br><br><br/><br/>as it turns out, I have an integrated wireless card that was never recognized by RH9 but that fedora picked up.  after <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/geoff/journal/14470">all the trouble I went through with my external card</a> I was pleasantly surprised that the internal interface worked with a few GUI clicks. sweet.!</p>

I also have a Thinkpad, which has had the same problems.  The hard drive started making noise like a motorcycle gang.  Taking it out and re-seating it didn't seem to fix it, but letting it cool off over night after doing that did.  Kind of scary really.  Also, the intgrated wireless can be made to work in a couple of ways.  I found a commercial driver that works ($20), and there is one Fedora kernel that works, but only one and it isn't the latest.<p>
Combined with the fact that the Thinkpad is THE HEAVIEST NOTEBOOK ON EARTH makes me think I might get something different next time.</p>
