<p>I was fortunate enough to have two of my talks chosen for <a href="http://yapc.org/America/schedule-2005/summary.html>YAPC::NA 2005</a>.<br/><br/><pre>
Writing Tests with Apache-Test, Part II:<br/><br/>At last year's YAPC, between the beer and buffalo wings, you got to know the basics of Apache-Test. Now, it's time to get familiar with what really makes it a really valuable testing platform. Apache-Test allows you to run tests directly within the mod_perl runtime environment, providing the ability to exercise server-side APIs in a way no other testing framework can. If mod_perl is your thing, you absolutely need to check this out.
</pre><br/><br/><pre>
A Few Cool Things About mod_perl 2.0:<br/><br/>mod_perl 2.0 is certainly a lot to digest. But hidden deep in the recesses of this new release are lots of features that you won't find at the forefront of the typical "why mod_perl 2.0" discussion but which are super cool. Oh, and they are important to your migration strategy too. This talk will outline a few of the important but lesser known features of mod_perl 2.0 that will get you thinking in new directions as you migrate away from mod_perl 1.0.
</pre><br/><br/>
unfortunately, the talk that I most wanted to do (<i>Testing PHP with Perl</i> with <a href="http://shiflett.org/">Chris Shiflett</a>) wasn't selected.  the talk met with a similar fate at <a href="http://conf.phpquebec.org/en/conf2005/">PHP Quebec</a>, which I gather is much like YAPC in its audience and expectations.  I guess neither side has much of an interest in the other, at least not in the testing arena, which I find odd since it seems like the more people I talk to from either side the more they are willing to admit there is some degree of crossover in both directions.  oh, well.</p>
