<p>in new jersey they have a law: you can't pump your own gas.  the theory I always tie this to is something I heard when I first started to drive.  basically, it was made a law so that filling stations would have to hire people so that more people could have more jobs.  I think lawyers generally follow the same logic: they create law suits mainly to keep themselves employed.<br><br>

<p>Oregon has a law like that and so does the little town in MA where I live. I suspect it reduces liability insurance since it doesn't effect the price of fuel much if at all.</p>

<p>Yes, Randal has been known to <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=author%3Arandal+author%3Aschwartz+gas+self&amp;hl=en&amp;scoring=d" title="google.com">rant</a google.com> about it on Usenet.</p>

<p>I first read the title of the journal entry as "save unicorn".</p>

<p>Well, I lived in Portland for a few years...it never threatened my masculinity to have someone else pump my gas for me.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) There are lots of more pressing things to get your panties in a bunch over.</p>

<p>No, Randal <em>likes</em> having other people pump his gas and is in favor of the law.</p>

I always thought it was because us non-professionals couldn't slop gasoline all over the side of the car nearly as well as the professionals do.
