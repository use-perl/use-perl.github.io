<p>after my trip out west, I decided that I would be much more productive if I replaced my old Pentium II 233 desktop from 1999 - new work will require running a few vmware nodes, among other things.  so, off I went in search of a new motherboard and chip...<br><br><br/><br/>oh, it seems there's a new RAM format (again) so the 93GB of PC-100 SIMMs I have laying around are worthless.  oh, and I'll need more than a 200W power supply to power the new chip, too.  fsck - all in all it would be about $400 to upgrade my existing desktop to something reasonable.  hmph.  or I can just run to my local Best Buy and grab up an entire PC, monitor, color printer, cd burner, 40GB hard drive, speakers, etc.  price after rebates: a cool $449.75.<br><br><br/><br/>of course, I don't need the monitor. or the printer.  or the speakers, mouse, or keyboard.  and I just bought a 120GB drive last month. for the most part, all I wanted was the motherboard, memory, and powersupply (and maybe a case that fit).  and I already had a burner.  so, I find it surreal that purchasing all those things I will never use provided me with $440 in rebates (plus $30 toward my next trip to Best Buy), which was a few hundred bucks less than if I had only bought just the tower, and about equal to buying only the parts I needed.  amazing.  ok, I'll use the drive, but still...<br><br><br/><br/>so, while waiting for the fedora ISO's to download I browsed by ebay - there are at least 75 different people selling the same printer "new in box" as well as 6 new monitors.  $100 for the pair.  looks like I might be able to save even more...</p>

<p>Heh, not to everyone!</p>

I could use some more RAM for my home box if you feel the need to give it away. Email me if you're serious.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
