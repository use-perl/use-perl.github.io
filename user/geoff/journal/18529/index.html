<p>so I've been trying to integrate <code>Test::More</code> as a backend for <code>Apache-Test</code>.  it's a bit complex but not too bad once I got my head around it.  anyway, all was going swimmingly until I tried to run more than one test, at which point <code>Test::More</code> (or more properly <code>Test::Builder</code>) was complaining about trying to call <code>plan()</code> twice.<br><br><br/><br/>as it turns out, there are a few package lexicals that cause trouble in a persistent environment like <code>Apache-Test</code>.  but never fear, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/mschwern/Test-Simple-0.48_01/"><code>Test::Simple 0.48_01</code></a> introduces <code>Test::Builder->reset()</code> which is just what I need.  I wonder if that's in <code>perl-5.8.0</code>?  nope.  <code>5.8.4</code>?  nope.  but wasn't the last release of <code>Test::Simple</code> back in August, 2002?  yup.  even maintperl is stuck on a 2 year old version of <code>Test::Simple</code>.  hmph.<br><br><br/><br/>so, what's the deal?  are <code>Test::More</code> and it's relatives being actively maintained? or have they reached the point where new (even written) features will never make it to core or CPAN?  I'm not familiar with their lifecycle, but with perl testing all the rage these days it's surprising that these core testing modules have been getting stale for so long...</p>

<h2>They're Stable and... hey look, an airplane!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2004-04-28T20:03:31</h3>
<p>Schwern and I have a plan to refactor <code>Test::Builder</code> into three separate pieces, but <code>Test::Simple</code> and <code>Test::More</code> are stable and don't need much besides bugfixes.  Also, we're easily distracted.</p>



<h2>and over there, it's something even cooler!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/geoff/">geoff</a> on 2004-04-28T20:19:10</h3>
yeah, I know what you mean.  tuits are hard to come by<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br><br/><br/>are you guys committed to the API, specifically the <code>reset()</code> bit?  I have an itch to get <code>Apache-Test</code> officially working with <code>Test::More</code> functions.  I have it working locally and it's <i>sweet</i><nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  but without an official API it's just not practical to set it loose in the wild.



<h2>0.48_01 is a developer release</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nicholas/">nicholas</a> on 2004-04-29T09:16:11</h3>

<p>0.47 is the latest stable release of Test::Simple. Like you, maintperl awaits a non-developer release.</p>
