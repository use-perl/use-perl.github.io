<p>overall, it was a pretty chaotic week, especially since it was not only my first week on the job, but it was also my first week back after three weeks away from the house.<br><br>
I spent the first few days getting the office squared away: building computers, loading software, pulling wires, connecting the new printer (and messing around with an appliance trying to use samba as a print server for the network), putting together a new desk,  cleaning up piles and piles of dust-covered papers, etc.  a word to people who want to telecommute - it takes more than desire and dedication, you <i>really</i> need to have the space.  I learned rather quickly that the space I had for occasionally checking email didn't quite fit the bill for extended coding sessions (I mean, come on, I didn't even have my speakers pulled out - who can seriously code without music?).  I also learned that an office without a door but a house full of children didn't work either.  so, now I have my pocket door installed, as well as an air-conditioner (the central doesn't really work up there), making the office both remote and cool.  maybe I should get a mini-fridge too...<br><br><br/><br/>after I got my main dev box situated and had a place to sit, I was able to wade through three weeks of email, fill out the requisite new hire forms, drive around in search of a UPS pickup for said forms.  then I started trying to be productive<br><br><br/><br/>A few more hours had bleedperl, 5.8.1-RC3, mod_perl 1.0, mod_perl 2.0 (and all their prerequisites), apache 1.3, apache 2.0 (prefork and worker), apache 2.1 (prefork and worker) installed and scripted to build nightly (well, not RC3 but the rest).  after verifying my 2.0 builds, I polished and tested a patch for the initial implementation of <code>have_apache_mpm()</code> in <code>Apache-Test</code> and committed it.  I also spent some time documenting the newly ported <code>Apache::CmdParms::info()</code> method that I had to put in for <a href="Integrating mod_perl with Apache 2.1 Authentication">my last perl.com article</a>.<br><br><br/><br/>oh, and there was also a proposal to host YAPC::NA 2004 at <a href="http://www.udel.edu/">Delaware</a> (my alma mater) thrown in there as well.  personally, I don't think I stressed the abundance of bars and high availability of cheap drinks enough in the proposal (really, wouldn't you like have a conference where there is continuous access to $2.50 nachos and $4.50 pitchers within walking distance of your room?)<br><br><br/><br/>next week, I hope to get down to some serious coding, starting with <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-modperl-dev&m=105431735200617&w=2">a proper stacked handler implementation in core</a>, which is long overdue.<br><br><br/><br/>and thus endeth my first week of gainful employment with Ticketmaster.  </p>
