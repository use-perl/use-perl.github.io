<p>well, it looks as though two of my proposals for this year's OSCon were accepted.  while I'm certainly glad (and honored) to have had my material accepted (fully understanding that there are always too few spots for too much good stuff), I'm a bit disappointed that the one I wanted to do the most didn't make the cut.<br><br>it was going to be a parallel of Matt's talk from last year, <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2002/view/e_sess/2479">Why SOAP Sucks, Why SOAP Rocks</a>, but focused on <a href="http://perl.apache.org/docs/2.0/">mod_perl 2.0</a>.  it's a shame really - after going through the motions of trying out mod_perl 2.0 myself, and after hearing "this sucks" from lots of experienced mod_perl folks when doing the same thing, I'm pretty sure that I could have presented a pretty inspiring and entertaining talk.  I mean, it still cracks me up that I can talk about <a href="http://www.modperlcookbook.org/cgi-bin/swish.cgi?query=assbackwards">assbackwards</a> and have it be a technically relevant difference between the two versions.<br><br>
oh, well.  maybe next year I'll think up a less controversial title...</p>

So what are your two talks?

I have a 3 hour tutorial, "Programming the Apache Lifecycle" (essentially the same tutorial I've given the past few years) and a 45 minute talk "Writing Tests with Apache::Test" (for which I probably asked for too short a time).  short descriptions follow:<br> <br>
<i>Programming the Apache Lifecycle</i> <br> <br>
mod_perl gives Perl developers the ability to put every aspect of Apache under their control so they can program within the Apache framework instead of around it. With all this power, knowing where to start is difficult.  This session will cover programming the Apache framework from the ground up, clearing the way for the myriad of possibilities mod_perl makes available.  Techniques specific to handling resource control, maintaining state, proper caching headers, and logging through the mod_perl API will round-out this session and start developers "thinking in mod_perl."
<br> <br>
<i>Writing Tests with Apache::Test</i> <br> <br>
Tests make your life easier, and Apache::Test makes writing live webserver tests easy.<br/><br/>This talk will introduce the Apache::Test interface and detail how to let it make your life easier.  We will step thought the processes of writing a complete test suite for a simple Apache:: module, from generating the Makefile.PL to deciding which aspects of our module ought to be tested - everything you need to be able to start writing tests for your neglected web applications.
<br> <br>
<i>Why mod_perl 2.0 sucks, why mod_perl 2.0 rocks  (no, this won't be at the conference)</i> <br> <br>
Have you tried working with mod_perl 2.0 yet?  Ugh.  With all those new classes and directives to learn, not to mention the list of incomplete features, you might as well stay with the trusty, stable mod_perl of old.  And subroutine attributes?  Eesh.<br/><br/>Of course, the new 2.0 API does let you do fun stuff like write input filters.  Oh, and there's the Apache::Test framework that's pretty cool.  Not to mention a method called assbackwards().<br/><br/>This brief, fun talk will introduce mod_perl 2.0 by poking fun at its shortcomings as well as showcasing its promise.

Good gosh, I think we oughta put our heads together.  Mine's going to talk about automated testing, including Apache::HTML::Lint.</p>

well, this will be more a story about how to setup and configure Apache::Test so that people can start using the interface - nuances of creating the Makefile.PL, what goes into the config files, where to put custom handlers, how to run in verbose mode or run single tests, etc.  it's less about testing methodologies.  there's only so much you can do in 45 minutes<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Oh, I understand.  But I wanna be able to 1) steal ideas from your talk, and 2) plug each other's talks.
<p>
It'd be nice if the conference schedule had hyperlinks between related talks...</p>

This is Perl.  There's no testing methodology, just people *doing* stuff!

(Yeah, I'm trying to be quotable.)

Glad to see you'll be back at OSCON. I guess this means that those of us who have heard nothing back yet did not make the cut.<br> <br>Maybe next year.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
