<p>I gave <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2002/view/e_sess/2573">my talk</a> first thing in the morning.  It went pretty well I guess - 31 people were scheduled and I think they all came, so it was a decent sized audience.<br><br>  I really think YAPC spoiled me a bit - the audience here wasn't nearly as advanced as the YAPC crowd, so instead of playing off my thoughts from last year (keep it simple) I ended up assuming too much.  
At any rate, only one person fell asleep, and the heckler in the audience (in the second row, of course) limited herself to a single comment ("You know, all this stuff is covered in the O'Reilly book"), so I think it went over about as well as it could have.<br><br>
For anyone who is interested, my tutorial slides are available <a href="http://www.modperlcookbook.org/user/geoff/slides/TPC/TPC6-printable.ppt.gz">here</a>.<br><br>
In the afternoon, I caught Ken Williams talk on machine learning, which was pretty neat - it's definitely a topic I wish I knew more about.  After that, Cindy and I got some Thai with Matt and Heather, followed by drinks at the hotel.<br><br><i>And there was evening, and there was morning-the second day.</i></p>
