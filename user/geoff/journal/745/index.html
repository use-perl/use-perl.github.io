<p>well, if I had had some tuits over the past few months I could have made ample use of the journaling system here at use.perl.org - working on <a href="http://www.modperlcookbook.org">the book</a> certainly led to many a random thought, but also kept me from even knowing this handy little thing existed as I've been so swamped in writing...<br><br>
anyway, I hope to make better use of this journal thingy as the weeks go by.  At this point, the book is 75% complete - hopefully the first writing pass will be complete by the end of september, the tweaking by the end of october, then on the shelves by january or february.  we'll see how it goes.<br><br>
at any rate, I'm here at my desk on Labor Day working feverishly.  on my mind today is <a href="http://www.apacheweek.com/issues/99-04-09#msie">this</a> bogus MSIE 512 byte thing.  I really want to write a mod_perl module that will fix this.  my initial idea is to just write one that just adds $Apache::ReadConfig::ErrorDocument for all the problem errors and uses Inline::Files to duplicate the default Apache responses (padded to 512).  seems like a lot of work, so I've been toying with the idea of hacking mod_perl core so that you can $r->custom_response(500, \&sub), which would be keen.  I'm getting slightly more familiar with XS due to some recent fooling around so I might just be able to put out a proof-of-concept on this sometime.<br><br>
not like this has anything to do with the chapter I'm working on today, but I feel as though my big accomplishment for this chapter is complete - a mod_perl API to hook into Digest authentication that is part perl, part XS...<br><br>
until the next brain dump...</p>
