<p>egads, it's been almost a month since I last did this?  where does the time go?<br><br><br/><br/>just been putting on the finishing touches on the last chapters of the book - the final chapter should be complete by friday.  then the real work begins - going back over all of this stuff and cleaning it up...<br><br><br/><br/>so, what have I done in the past month?  well, it's all in chapters 14-16.  the coolest parts are this neato module Paul and I came up with to intercept the Apache error_log on a per-request basis.  that one's a keeper.  There is a PerlTypeHandler in there that could be pretty popular, and a SOAP example that queries a HalfLife game server to get back the OS, map, module etc.  not practical, but fun.<br><br><br/><br/>I got a PerlDispatchHandler to work today.  I'm not sure I understand the utility of that hook - the only documentation I could find on anyone using it was back in 1997 when Andreas came up with the idea.  The code required for a PerlDispatchHandler is absolutely insane when you think about it - all you get is the raw "My::Foo" and you have to figure out whether they meant My::Foo::handler() or My::Foo(), not to mention dealing with CVs, anonymous subroutines passed in as strings, and method handlers where the only trigger is the prototype.  ack.  well, my code handles all but hidden method handlers, which isn't bad for
something nobody will ever use...<br><br><br/><br/>there is still lots of stuff in the book pipeline, but hopefully everyone will get the chance to see it soon - Sams (the publisher) threw it up on Amazon this week with a publish date of December 21.  don't hold your breath - february is more like it...<br/><br/></p>
