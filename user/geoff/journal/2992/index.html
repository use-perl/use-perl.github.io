<p>I hate headhunters, recruiters, and all their associated ilk...<br><br>
yesterday, I get an email at a deprecated email address.<br><br><i>Your resume has just surfaced in a search that I am conducting for a
locally based client.  I would like for an opportunity to talk with you
about your background and see if you might have some interest at this
time.</i><br><br>why do all these people think this is sufficient information?  no, I'm not going to waste my time and call you just because you think I might have interest in <i>something</i>.  my typical response is<br><br><i> perhaps you could elaborate a bit more on the client, the type of work involved, and why my resume piqued your interest.</i><br><br>now, my resume hasn't been updated in a very long time, but he responds with<br><br><i> My client is located in South Jersey and they are seeking a
professional who has both Oracle DBA skills on a Linux platform (preferably Red Hat)</i><br><br>how they figured I was an Oracle DBA is beyond me.  yeah, I prefer Oracle as my database of choice (I know, I know...) and can run my own instance for testing code out and other stuff, but I never claimed to be a DBA.  eesh.<br><br>granted, I might feel differently about headhunters if I were hardpressed for a job, but the total lack of effort on the part of every headhunter I've encountered is unbelievable.  leeches, all of them.</p>
