<p>I just saw this in the Java SDK license agreement:<br><br><i>
8.  Trademarks  and  Logos.  You  acknowledge  and  agree as
between  you and Sun that Sun owns the SUN,  SOLARIS,  JAVA,
JINI, FORTE, and iPLANET  trademarks  and all SUN,  SOLARIS,
JAVA, JINI, FORTE, and iPLANET-related  trademarks,  service
marks, logos and other brand designations ("Sun Marks"), and
you agree to comply  with the Sun  Trademark  and Logo Usage
Requirements          currently          located          at
http://www.sun.com/policies/trademarks.  Any use you make of
the Sun Marks inures to Sun's benefit.</i><br><br>
so, Sun has trademarked its name ("Sun Marks") for its trademarks?  They probably even paid somebody to think that up.  I'm clearly in the wrong field.<br><br><br/><br/>of course, you may wonder why I was loading up the Java SDK anyway.  well, it looks as though I'm going to be rolling out some of my classes as a SOAP service after all.  to get around the <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/geoff/journal/9844">complex object</a> limitation I ended up writing a wrapper class that allows Java to call each method as a function, with the wrapper creating the objects and dispatching them behind the scenes.  I even prototyped the Java code using <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/index.html">Axis</a> and it worked.  still, working code or not, it wasn't nearly as fun as Perl - there's almost nothing in core Perl as cool as <code>AutoLoader</code>.</p>

<p>
I don't think it's that at all.  It looks to me like the verbiage in contracts where they define a word in passing, as in:
</p><blockquote><div>
Andy Lester of 123 Sesame Street, McHenry, Illinois ("You") agrees to hold MegaGlomCo, its subsidiaries, its assigns, and any associated contractors ("MegaGlomCo") not liable for....
</div></blockquote>

yeah, I guess that's why IANAL.  I suppose had they really wanted to be cute it would have been "Sun Spots" instead<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
