<p>so, I just went a few rounds with a user getting <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WebService-CaptchasDotNet/">WebService-CaptchasDotNet</a> working while running in taint mode.  not the world's most important module, but something that is apparently being used and needing fixing.<br><br>as it turns out, the user didn't know much about perl - didn't know about <code>PREFIX</code> or <code>use lib</code> to manage local installs on a hosted machine, for example - so I gave him a few pointers along the way, in addition to fixing my module so it worked for him.  in truth, I really didn't do much, and I was kinda embarrassed that it took two iterations to fix the problem.  but it's all in a day's work for most of us here in the open source world, right? <br/><br/><pre>

</pre><br/><br/>I think I'm a little sad that the default user state is that they think they'll be alone when using code from CPAN or other open source projects.</p>

<h2>open source or purchased?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cbrandtbuffalo/">cbrandtbuffalo</a> on 2005-09-27T14:57:56</h3>
You're assuming his attitude is based on his open source expectation. Without any more detail, I'd be more likely to assume his attitude is based on his experience with purchased stuff. Do you think he would have gotten that kind of response from the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.Net developers if the problem was on that side?



<h2>I am not sure I would take it that way...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2005-09-27T15:59:00</h3>
When I use stuff from CPAN and find bugs, I report them. When the actual author emails me back to talk me through the problem and then fixes it, I am always surprised since I usually think "the author is busy" and so a bug report is enough for me.

<p>I agree with the others that this is not necessarily reflective of prior experience with &#8220;open source&#8221; any more than it might be reflective of experience with &#8220;software projects&#8221; or with &#8220;closed source&#8221; or &#8220;packaged products&#8221; or any other collective. How do you know it&#8217;s the particularly collective you associate with? That&#8217;s merely your bias, if you ask.</p>

<p>It might even be reflective of no experience at all.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been vanity searching the web for mentions of <a href="http://plasmasturm.org/code/gtk-chtheme" title="plasmasturm.org">a small utility of mine</a plasmasturm.org> now, and I&#8217;ve found that few people tend to think to report back to the author himself. I saw a number of people write about it in their weblogs or file bugs on distribution trackers; things I would never have heard of, had I not searched for them myself.</p>

<p>People just don&#8217;t seem to expect that the creator of something they use, particularly when they perceive it as complicated enough that they couldn&#8217;t recreate it, would spend time to converse with them and help them solve their problem.</p>

<p>I think there are a number of factors that play into this, all of which have to do with people not realising how close the web really brings everyone together. Before I dipped my toes into the Perl community, I would never have dreamt I&#8217;d ever have a chance to chat with, say, Larry Wall &#8211; in retrospect, it&#8217;s almost cute how misguided my preconceptions were. This thing works so very differently from all the old media and their deep chasm between consumers and the makers.</p>
