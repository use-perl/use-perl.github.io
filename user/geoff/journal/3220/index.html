<p>I just received a copy of the new SOAP <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/progwebsoap/">book</a> from O'Reilly.  Paul Kulchenko was kind enough to review the Apache::SOAP stuff we wrote in our book, so we exchanged book copies.<br><br>
I've only skimmed it so far, but I did read over the first two chapters.  Man, I think I'm going to buy a copy for each of my managers - they do a great job of explaining the entire concept of web services, which just seems to go over the heads of about everyone who makes web services decisions around here.  who know, maybe after they read up on SOAP, I'll stop needing to sigh after I hear "maybe we should be writing a CORBA or JEB interface for this stuff?"<br><br>I just <i>love</i> <a href="http://www.soaplite.com/">SOAP::Lite</a>, and the work Paul has done on it is nothing short of amazing.  As I said in the book, SOAP::Lite is so incredible that it has this eerie, supernatural property to it if you really think about it - it still boggles my mind.</p>

That supernatural property has a name: dwimmery.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
<tt>SOAP::Lite</tt> is easily one of the dwimmiest modules I've ever used.  The best part about it is that <i>it just works</i>.</p>
