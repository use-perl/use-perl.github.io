<p>one of our databases consists of mysql myisam tables, which don't have transactions so you can't rollback.  this makes debugging and 'dry-run' modes very difficult.  one of my coworkers suggested DBD::NullP but that doesn't quite fit the bill - I want to pull data, inspect it, but no commit changes...<br><br><br/><br/>what I really need is some DBD driver that intercepts write statements (UPDATE, REPLACE, etc) and turns them in to no-ops.  DBD::Proxy and/or DBD::ProxyServer seems to <i>almost</i> get me there, but I don't feel like I should have to go through a complex acl-style process for all my code - I should be able to swap out the driver and it should all just work.<br/><br/>so, has anyone done anything like this?  I'm contemplating writing something like DBD::NullWrites, which should be relatively simple once I get my head around the DBD API.  and after figuring out whether I can make it generic to apply to any read-front-end (DBD::Oracle for reads, DBD::NullWrites for writes, etc).  pointers from folks who have ventured into DBD:: space appreciated :)</p>

<h2>What about Mocking?</h2>

How about DBD::Mock or Test::MockDBI?

nope, those won't do - reads really need to work so I can watch the program iterating over the record set and doing something to it.  I just don't want the commits to be effective in an environment where I can't naturally undo them.  so, mocking the DBI objects to just see that the sql is properly formed does't fit the bill...

<h2>Two not-so-good solutions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ChrisDolan/">ChrisDolan</a> on 2006-12-13T15:51:26</h3>
I have used the following two heavy-handed solutions in the past.  Neither of them are good solutions for big databases, but they can get the job done where disk space is not a concern.<br><br>1) Once per day, replicate the database to a dev copy.  Run all tests on the dev database, destructively<br><br>2) Copy-on-write.  I wrote a DBI facade which intercepted SQL prepares and, upon seeing an insert or update, copied the table to a new table and thereafter altered all SQL to replace the name of the old table with the new one.  This was brittle because it required parsing SQL, so I only implemented for the small subset of SQL that the client was using.<br>



<h2>UID</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Abigail/">Abigail</a> on 2006-12-13T16:03:32</h3>
You might want to run your queries as a user that only has read permission - and ignore any insert/delete errors caused by insufficient permission.

<h2>Re:UID</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/geoff/">geoff</a> on 2006-12-13T16:47:14</h3>
yeah, that's an option I've used.  but it's a bit clumsy and somewhat dangerous as you need to remember to change the uid.  in my situation, I want to offer a <code>--dry-run</code> option to all our scripts across the board, which works fine except for the databases that don't support transactions...

<h2>Perhaps a DBI subclass ?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/renodino/">renodino</a> on 2006-12-13T18:53:04</h3>
If you want to preserve the connection to the orignal DBMS, but just filter out INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE[/CREATE/ALTER/DROP],
maybe a DBI subclass is the solution ? e.g., "DBIx::ReadOnly" ? DBIx::Chart  (<a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/darnold/DBIx-Chart-0.05/" title="cpan.org">http://search.cpan.org/user/darnold/DBIx-Chart-0.05/</a cpan.org>) might be useful as a template (tho overbuilt for your purposes).<p>

BTW: If you're using some DBI wrapper (DBIXC, CDBI, etc),
you'll likely need to specify the subclass via the RootClass connect() attribute.</p>
