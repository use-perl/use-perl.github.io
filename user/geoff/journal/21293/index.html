<p>I just received an email that my <a href="http://www.apachecon.com/2004/US/index.html">ApacheCon </a> tutorial, "Test-Driven Apache Module Development", does not have enough registered attendees to be above the break-even point, which means it may be in danger of being cancelled.  a similar thing happened <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/geoff/journal/19094">with my OSCon tutorial</a> which, oddly enough, ended up being one of only a handful of tutorials that were sold out in the end.  go figure.<br><br><br/><br/>anyway, here is the description (very un-sexy) I came up with for the tutorial:<br/><br/><pre>
 Writing tests is up there with documentation as the thing we coders dread the most, but for Apache developers it doesn't need to be that way. With the Apache-Test framework, the engine behind much of the httpd-test project, testing your code can be more exciting than writing it! Imagine a world
where your Apache module contains a full suite of integrated tests that even your boss can run - it's self-documenting fun!<br/><br/>In this session you will learn about using the Apache-Test toolkit to:<br/><br/>  - issue a single command that will configure Apache, start the server, run your tests, shutdown the server, and issue a success report
  - test against 1.3, 2.0, or 2.1 Apache server installations
  - use the test framework to automatically compile and configure Apache C modules
  - write simple test scripts that mimic client behaviors
  - examine basic testing principles to help methodically guide test writing
  - impress your boss, get a raise, make new friends<br/><br/>If you develop or maintiain Apache modules in either C or Perl then this is one session you can't afford to miss.
</pre><br/><br/>in a nutshell, all of that means that it will be a guided tour of using the amazing <code>Apache-Test</code> framework to set up automated testing of all things Apache.  I actually am planning on making the tutorial semi-interactive, moving through code examples in a tarball and having attendees try to run them with different options on their own as we go.  overall, I think it will be a great learning experience for attendees, as I use <code>Apache-Test</code> every day and have all kinds of cool and helpful things to share.<br><br><br/><br/>anyway, if you have an interest in this kind of thing, please go ahead and register while there is still room.  ApacheCon is a great conference, with a different, more intimate feel than OSCon, and will be well worth your time.</p>
