<p>I've recently noticed something rather strange showing up in TV commercials: people I recognize.  for instance, last night I saw an IBM commercial that had <a href="http://www.facethemusicthemovie.com/images/hshots/marshall.html">the guy</a> from Total Recall (you know, the one with the mutant in his stomach).  then, the other day, there's some random ad with <a href="http://www.brendastrong.com/">the heiress to the O'Henry family fortune</a> on it (who was also in Party of 5, yes I was an addict).  I think I've seen a few others as well.  maybe it's me, but commercials with actors I recognize trying to be regular people (instead of some celebrity plugging a product) is entirely distracting (which may be a good thing - I really don't need to hire IBM right now).<br><br>
I guess even screen actors (for lack of a better term) are in such dire straits for jobs that they are taking whatever they can get.  kinda like programmers...</p>
