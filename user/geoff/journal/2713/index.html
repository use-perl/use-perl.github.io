<p>I hate my job.<br><br>
I had the most terrible day at work today in my more than two years with this company.  It was also my birthday, which made it doubly bad.<br><br>
Of course, I'm not complaining too much - at least I have a job and, in this economy I am happy to keep it.  Pains, butthead co-workers, and all.<br><br>
I am simply stunned by the number of outstanding software developers looking for jobs within our own Perl community.  As a recent author, I am even more shocked to see that a large number of authors (whose books are either well perceived by the community or are eagerly awaited by others who know the quality of work the people are capable of) are running around unemployed.  Off the top of my head, I can name at least half a dozen people either published or working on a book that are seeking a paying day job (we all know books don't pay the bills themselves).  Other top-notch people, people who don't write books or articles but instead spend their time writing the software we use and depend on every day, have gone months without work.  It simply boggles my mind.<br><br>
pudge, if you read this, perhaps you can start a new poll: are you an author and, if so, how long have you gone without work in the past year.</p>

<h2>I never thought of that...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2002-02-08T03:22:39</h3>
That's weird, but true.  Count me on your list -- especially the "highly regarded" and "eagerly anticipated part".<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>some authors have jobs</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2002-02-08T14:22:33</h3>
I'm afraid I don't fit your role - I have a job.  I had no salary for one week at the beginning of January 2001, but that was just the interim between the end of my previous job (which had lasted 11 1/2 years and had survived <i>the book</i>) and the start of my new job.  Despite the economy shift in the past year, I didn't get laid off.

  Happy Birthday Geoff !!!
