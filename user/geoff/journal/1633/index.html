<p>today I wrote a sendmail log parsing script.  a few interesting things happened while I was working on it.<br><br>
$ perl -cw myscript<br><br>yielded<br><br>
"use" may collide with future keyword<br><br>
eh?  seems that /usr/bin/perl on this box was Perl 4 *gasp*<br><br>
that was good for a chuckle.<br><br><br/><br/>anyway, instead of writing my own log parser (which is probably just as common as writing your own templating system) I borrowed one.  I used <a href="http://www.smashing.org/apps/mtop.tar.gz">mtop</a> which was written by friend and former co-worker Jeff Horwitz.  thanks to Jeff, all I have to do is tear apart his work to get what I need, not write it myself.  kudos to open source...<br><br><br/><br/>speaking of Jeff, a few months ago he lets me in on an alpha of <a href="http://www.smashing.org/apps/extproc_perl.tar.gz">extproc_perl</a>.  If you like perl and are an oracle slave (like me), then you should probably check it out.  extroc_perl is mod_perl ala oracle - perl embedded in oracle, so you can use perl methods and regular expressions from SQL or PL/SQL.  smashing, baby.<br><br><br/><br/>
With <a href="http://www.modperlcookbook.org/>the book</a> and all, I haven't had the time to properly play with extproc_perl, but I think the time is ripe. Last friday, he stops by for lunch and I get the skinny on what's going with it.  Besides a bit of press on the <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/dbi-users@perl.org/msg07911.html">DBI users list</a>, it appears as though everyone will know about extroc_perl before too long (wink, wink).  So, if you want to be cool, impress your friends, and be a trend-setter, check it out...</p>

I'm surprised more people don't know that you can actually write entire stored procedures in PostgreSQL using Perl. This is pretty neat - you can open cursors and navigate through them using all the common idioms in Perl we know and love (map, grep, etc).
<br>
<br>Also, on a similar note: Pg 7.2b4 was released this week, with mucho performance improvements over 7.1... Should blow MySQL out of the water real soon now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

There is something similar like that for MySQL, though I can't say how good it is.  It's still early in development, called <a href="http://software.tangent.org/search.pl?query=myperl" title="tangent.org">myperl</a tangent.org>.
