<p>at the last <a href="http://www.apachecon.com/">ApacheCon</a>, <a href="http://www.tsok.net/home.tpl">The Sound of Knowledge</a> was giving special discounts to speakers for videos and audio CDs of their presentations.  I ordered both and they came in the mail the other day, so I decided to sit down and watch my two hour presentation in the name of honest critique.<br><br>
this is probably something every speaker ought to do, but it certainly isn't pretty.  while I knew that this particular talk didn't go as well as it had the other times I have given it (due to the time of day, that I wasn't able to play <i>my</i> music while setting up, and other things), I didn't realize that I was, at various times, utterly unintelligible and inarticulate - there were a few times that I know I was speaking, and it most certainly wasn't in a language anybody could claim to understand.  
<br><br>
part of the problem was that I was going very fast - I've given that talk before and it generally takes me over 2 hours, but this time I finished 10 minutes early.  and I'm sure that the music had something to do with it (something to mention to the next set of planners).  at any rate, I saw lots of things I can do to make my speaking better, so I'll have to work on those for next time.
<br><br>
next time you speak, have a friend record you, either on video or just audio.  it's very enlightening.</p>
