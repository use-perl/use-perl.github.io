<p>I finally went out and bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0932633439/">Peopleware</a>, as suggested by a number of people <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/geoff/journal/8225">in my journal</a>. I'm about to  hand chapters 10 and 11 over to my manager to digest for a while...<br><br>
<i>... for anyone involved in engineering, design, development, writing, or like tasks, flow is a must.  These are high momentum tasks.  It's only when you're in flow that the work goes well.  Unfortunately, you can't turn on flow like a switch.  It takes a slow descent into the subject, requiring 15 mintes or more of concentration before the state is locked in.  During this immersion period, you are particularly sensitive to noise and interruption... Each time you're interrupted, you require an additional immsersion period to get back into flow.  During this immersion, you're not really doing work."<br><br>
"When electronic mail was first proposed, most of us thought that the great value of it would be the saving in paper.  That turns out to be trivial, however, compared to the saving in reimmersion time.  The big difference between a phone call and an electronic mail message is that the phone interrupts and the e-mail does not... We have to learn to ask, Does this news or question deserve an interrupt?  Can I continue to get work done while I wait for an answer?  Does  this message need immediate recognition?"</i><br><br>
what caused me to spend $35 on a management book?  my manager instisted I install AIM this morning.</p>

<h2>PeopleWare, updated</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dws/">dws</a> on 2003-01-13T19:58:11</h3>
A good follow-on to <i>PeopleWare</i> is Alistair Cockburns <i> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201699699/" title="amazon.com">Agile Software Development</a amazon.com>,</i> which is as much about information flow within teams as it is about Agile methodologies. Several chapters are management must-reads. Cockburn takes the "interruptions are expensive" mantra, and expands on it significantly.

Seconded. Agile Software Development is a <em>cracking</em> book.

<h2>AIM, GAIM</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2003-01-13T21:55:08</h3>
I'm not sure about AIM, but I use GAIM personally, and there's an option under preferences/IM Window called "raise windows on events" that you can disable.  You can also disable sound.  This should minimize disruptions.  You just have to remember to look from time to time.
<p>
Also, remember where your traffic is going.  See http://gaim-encryption.sourceforge.net/</p>
