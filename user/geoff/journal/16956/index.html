<div class="span8">
<p>I spent yesterday in New York at <a href="http://www.linuxworldexpo.com/">LinuxWorld</a>.  all in all, it was kind of dull.  But my main reason for going was to maintain some geek social ties (it's hard to do that when you work from home).  So, I spent most of the day hanging out with <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/shiflett/journal">Chris</a>, <a href="http://www.trachtenberg.com/">Adam</a>, and  <a href="http://www.sklar.com/blog/">Dave</a> (all PHP guys, but really good guys nonetheless :).  I also ran into a few <a href="http://ny.pm.org/">ny.pm</a> people.  I even met somebody from <a href="http://www.lispnyc.org/">LispNYC</a> - complete with <i>I-heart-()</i> business cards - who turned me on to <a href="http://www.cliki.net/mod_lisp">mod_lisp</a>.   in the evening we met up with <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/gnat/journal">gnat</a> to hang about and chat.  all in all, a pretty cool day.<br><br>
as it turned out, though, not only did I forget to bring business cards with my email on them, but I also lost my voice (due, in part to a cold and in part to the -317 degree wind-chill in the city).  so, for all the new people I met I sounded either like a grizzled jazz musician from the '50s, a carton-a-day chain smoker, or a 13 year old boy (or girl) in the throws of puberty.  I bet I left quite an impression, even without business cards...</p>

I was wondering if you'd be there.  I should have e-mailed you before and made a plan.  I did talk to Nat for a bit, and got a copy of his new book.  I saw "mod_perl Developer's Cookbook" being sold by a guy with a table set up on the sidewalk of 34th St!

rats, sorry we didn't hook up.  it's hard to see everyone when you visit.<br> <br><br/><br/>and I saw the book too.  when I asked how much he said $20, but was then willing to take $15 when I hesitated...
