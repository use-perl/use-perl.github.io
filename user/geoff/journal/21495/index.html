<p>so I'm trying to use both DBD::SQLite and php (5.0.2) to access the same sqlite database.  depending on who creates the database file I get<br/><br/><pre>
file is encrypted or is not a database

<h2>Different SQLite versions?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2004-10-25T09:56:39</h3>
That sounds like a probably reason. SQLite 2.x and 3.x are not compatible qua databasefile.
<p>I don't know what version of SQLite PHP 5 is using, but checking for Perl is quite easy, according to the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/MSERGEANT/DBD-SQLite-1.07/Changes" title="cpan.org">changes file</a cpan.org>, DBD::SQLite started using SQLite 3 starting with DBD::SQLite version 1.00. So, whatever version it is you have, try installing the latest one of the other generation.
</p><p>I wish Perl had a better way to have different generations of modules live together, but I think the best you can do in order not to mess the existing installation up, is install the other version in a separate libroot, and use <tt> <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=lib" title="cpan.org">lib</a cpan.org> </tt>  to make Perl load that one in your script. Due to the way DBI works, this will happen at run time, when you <tt>connect()</tt> to the database.</p>

<p>And thus the reason for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=DBD%3A%3ASQLite2&amp;mode=all" title="cpan.org">DBD::SQLite2</a cpan.org>.  From the README for DBD::SQLite2,
</p><blockquote><div>
Note: DBD::SQLite2 is the old version of DBD::SQLite, and embeds version 2.x.x of the sqlite library. The current version of DBD::SQLite embeds version 3 (or possibly later if I forget to update this file). This release is designed to allow you to have both versions installed on the same system.

The SQLite 3.0 thread just occured on php-internals. It'll happen, but not before ApacheCon.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>-adam

cool.<br> <br><br/><br/>while this is neither a php nor perl concern, I was able to put my finger on why this all felt so strange to me this week at nyphp: if versions 2 and 3 databases are not compatible, I would expect that a version 2 client would bomb, however I would expect a version 3 client to say "whoa - you're using a version 2 database."  the way it is now, you get this cryptic "file is encrypted" error in both directions, which is very user unfriendly.

I just came across this same problem today, and this post helped me as well.  The error that the SQLite libraries provide is certainly a bit cryptic and not helpful at all.  Well, it is helpful when running it through Google, but we really shouldn't have to do that.
