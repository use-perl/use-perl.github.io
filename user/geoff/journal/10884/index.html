<p>well, after a few weeks of hard work, I managed to (finally) get that mod_perl 2.0 article over to Simon.  Along with the article is a <a href="http://www.modperlcookbook.org/user/geoff/modules/Apache-Clean-2.01b.tar.gz">new release</a> of <code>Apache::Clean</code>, which stemmed from all the research that I did for the article.<br><br>
I really have to hand it to Stas.  At first, I asked him to just review the article.  Then we got into a converstation about whether it was time to start writing about mod_perl 2.0 yet.  Then we got into a discussion about the nuances of output filters.  Then he griped a bit about how an important part (to him) of the API wasn't finished yet, then I griped a bit about how it was working fine but an important part (to me) wasn't finished yet.  When it was all over, I had a (reasonably) accurate understanding of how things needed to work and finished the article.  Stas went on to update <a href="http://perl.apache.org/docs/2.0/user/handlers/filters.html">the documentation</a> based on the different parts of the API we flushed out over the course of the conversation.  Overall, the article probably will increase his (already stretched) mod_perl workload significantly, but he didn't seem to mind, which is just like him.<br><br>
many kudos to Stas.
<br><br>
meanwhile, now that there is an example of a mod_perl output filter (one that really works, anyway) on CPAN, hopefully people will see how powerful mod_perl can be.  I keep getting a kick when <code>mod_blanks</code> discussions pop up on <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-httpd-dev&w=2&r=1&s=mod_blanks&q=b">new-httpd</a> - if only they saw how easy it is to do that with Perl.</p>
