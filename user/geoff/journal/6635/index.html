<p>wednesday was a pretty nice day.  I skipped the keynote and had a nice breakfast with my wife, which was nice since we haven't spent all that much time alone vacationing yet.  after that, I caught some of the Perl 6 stuff, which was enlightening and entertaining, though I don't think I'll ever buy into <code>err</code> (maybe we should have <code>duh</code> or <code>well, uh</code> as well - <code>do $this or, well, uh...</code>).<br><br>
midway through the Perl 6 stuff I left to go listen to Antoine's SVG talk, which was really cool.  In the afternoon I sat for a photo shoot with Julian, which was lots of fun - Julian is a really nice and interesting guy, and I can't wait to see how some of the pictures turned out.<br><br>dinner was just Cindy and I at a mexican restaurant, which was followed by drinks on the deck at the hotel.  late in the evening (1am) Kip Hampton pulled out his harmonica, Eric Cholet hit the piano, and Heather Sergeant started to belt out the tunes.  I wish I had any ammount of talent like these guys.</p>
