<div class="span8">
<p>well, over the weekend we got our first sales statement for <a href="http://www.modperlcookbook.org/">the book</a>, which covered february, the first month it was available.   I have to say that I really don't know how to approach the numbers to know whether they are good or bad, but I can't help but feel a bit disappointed at how low they are.  it's not like I was expecting to take the world by storm or anything, but I did think that the first major book on <a href="http://perl.apache.org/">mod_perl</a> to come in three years would have a bigger impact, especially when all the feedback we've gotten so far has been positive.<br><br>mind you, it's not about more money in our pockets (and while that helps, we're a <i>long</i> way from earning out that advance anyway).  what makes it really disappointing for me is that the main goal (at least for me) was to increase the visibility of mod_perl as a leading technology - kinda like how 500 books on .NET somehow makes corporate decision makers think they need to start deploying it.  and the more places that deploy it, the more likely it is that I (and others like me) get to keep using something we all think of as <a href="http://www.modperlcookbook.org/chapters/foreword.pdf">fun</a>.<br><br><br/><br/>of course, having lots and lots of good reviews would help spread the word about the book, which would in turn help the mod_perl (or at least that's the idea).  we've actually had quite a few people interested in writing reviews, but those have yet to come to fruition - probably because people are just plain busy these days trying to keep their jobs, and doing a thorough job on a 650 page book is no easy chore. <br/><br/><br><br>but I keep coming back to <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/webservices/2001/11/16/indicator.html">this article</a> and the obvious corrolary: that when times are tough people are hesitant to fork over $40 for a book that may or may not be worthwhile, which says as much for our book as it does for mod_perl in general.  and that saddens me.</p>

<p>It's not your book.</p>



<h2>It's a Great Book</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2002-04-04T15:48:39</h3>
I still plan to do a very thorough review.  This is not an excuse, but my relocation and new job have sucked up quite a bit of free time.
<p>
It *ought* to sell well, if I have anything to say about it.</p>



<h2>Book buying</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/exeunt/">exeunt</a> on 2002-04-04T16:44:13</h3>
There was a time, if I saw a book on Perl, and it looked interesting, I would buy it. As more and more crap books (not just Perl ones), started flooding the market, I got a little more picky. I now have a list of books I'd like to buy, and since mod_perl is on my list of things to learn, your book is on it!<br> <br>I did plan on making a trip to Barnes and Nobel tonight, plus I have to renew my Readers Advantage card, since I usually get my investment of 25-30 bucks back with the extra 10% discount of buying books in a few months anyway.



<h2>Selling into a down market</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dws/">dws</a> on 2002-04-04T17:37:29</h3>
You're selling a good book into a down market. Looking around a friends' bookbuying habits, and looking at mine, all are down over the last year unless the books are expensable. Even then, many companies are tightening up.<br>



<h2>Just ...</h2>

...as soon as I have some money to spare..
