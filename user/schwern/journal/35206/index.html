There are, as you can see, a few nits.  That trailing semicolon for one.  The other is it doesn't work on "sub" so all you get right now is methods.  These are all Devel::Declare issues.<br/><br/>The prototype syntax is very simplistic and does no checks.  Expanding on that is the easy part, or at least just a SMOP.  I plan on stealing a bunch of features from Perl 6.</p>

<p>
Very nice! My wrists thank you<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p>
<p>
You should stop by #moose and chat, I know mst has been planning on writing a Perl 6-ish Moose wrapper using Devel::Declare (tentatively called Moose::Declare), but has been without the tuits to do it. We also already have some work towards method signature checking with MooseX::Method, which can easily be converted to use a Devel::Declare based syntactic sugar. There has also been some talk of pulling the type system out of Moose so it is easier to use it in non-Moose situations, which could be helpful for this kind of stuff.

Innovative. Thanks for sharing this.<br><br>I wish for customizing the name of "$self", but this is a nice start, and a welcome competitor to "self.pm", which I also liked it was a little weird because it was "self", not "$self", and didn't actually allow you to "shift" off $self through the system, just reference it.<br><br>Wow, that was a run-on sentence.<br><br>

Mark: You just inspired me to write selfvars.pm, now on CPAN.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Wow, Thanks Audrey. I like it.<br><br>I wonder if it used "Sub::Exporter", if the "self"   scalar name could be easily customized, like it can for "self.pm". However, I don't see any examples in the Sub::Exporter docs of exporting scalars. (Perhaps only because it is recommended against in most cases).

<h2>Re: sefvars.pm</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/audreyt/">audreyt</a> on 2007-12-28T12:21:58</h3>
No, it doesn't use Sub::Exporter; as of version 0.05, it manages the exporting by itself.
<p>
You can customize the "self" scalar name with an import line:</p><p><blockquote> <div><tt>use selfvars -self =&gt; 'this', -args =&gt; 'opts';</tt></div> </blockquote> Or only import self as $this but not args:<p><blockquote> <div><tt>use selfvars -self =&gt; 'this';</tt></div> </blockquote> Or only import self as $self:<p><blockquote> <div><tt>use selfvars -self;</tt></div> </blockquote> More suggestions are welcome as well!

Clever, but performance is awful.  Tied variables.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(<br><br>Then again, I've found some fascinating bugs in Method::Signatures.<br>

True, but although there is technically a 10-fold difference between 1191563/s vs 114688/s per lookup, in practice I wonder how it's going to matter -- even if it's put in a loop that's going to look up $self more than 100000 times, the difference will still be less than one second.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

$self gets used an awful lot.  It's one of those things that adds a drag to every single aspect of your code.  As much as we'd like to, you can't always ignore the constant part of big-O.

That's beautiful, Audrey, thank you. One thought - I  always pass by reference, that is to say, $vars. If that could make it into a future selfvars.pm as an option, it would be awesome.



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:innovative</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/audreyt/">audreyt</a> on 2007-12-29T05:08:05</h3>
Do you mean that you always pass a single by-name hash reference argument, in a PBP-esque fashion?<p><blockquote> <div><tt>$obj-&gt;meth({ a =&gt; 1, b =&gt; 2 });</tt></div> </blockquote> If so, how about making available a %opts so you can say:<p><blockquote> <div><tt>sub meth {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $self-&gt;foo($opts{a});<br>}</tt></div> </blockquote> If you wish you can even import selfvars like this, populating named options into %_:<p><blockquote> <div><tt>use selfvars -opts =&gt; '_', -self;<br>sub meth {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $self-&gt;foo($_{a});<br>}</tt></div> </blockquote> Would that resemble what you want?

0.10 of selfvars very definitely resembles what I want. I dub thee Lady Leet of Awesomeland!

<h2>Unstable magic</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjore/">jjore</a> on 2007-12-27T06:51:48</h3>
Devel::Declare strikes me as likely to be unstable magic. It messes with the yy* parts of the parser during its operation. How likely is<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/that/ to keep working?<br><br>I've always looked at that part of perl and gone "OMG, this is nasty looking" so perhaps this is not as horrible as I'm imagining. I just don't think it's the kind of thing of which stable software is made. In a year from now if it continues to work on 5.6 -&gt; 5.11 I guess I could believe it then. There'll be more than enough unanticipated delta to stress this thing out.

<h2>Re:Unstable magic</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/schwern/">schwern</a> on 2007-12-28T21:24:49</h3>
You'd have to ask Matt Trout for details, I know he has plans to move as much magic as possible out of the C hack and into Perl.  At least it's stable with any given release of Perl.  It's not like those exactly SNEAK up on us.
