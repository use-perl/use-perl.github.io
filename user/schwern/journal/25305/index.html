<div class="span8">
<p><p>I just <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=45731">checked in</a> the finishing touches on --prefix support for Module::Build.  Module::Build 0.27_02 will have "perl Build.PL --prefix=..." to mirror "perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=...".  More importantly, Module::Build's generated Makefile.PLs can finally emulate PREFIX.

<p>IS EVERYBODY HAPPY NOW?!

<p><b>EDIT:</b>I forgot to mention that it was Rob Kinyon who took first stab at the --prefix patch and got me off my ass to finish it off.  Everybody say "thank you, Rob".

<p>This feature was auctioned off at OSCON 2004 and I wish I had the names of the folks who ponied up.  Bill Odom probably has them, I'll see if I can get them from him.

<p><b>EDIT:</b>  Bill came through with the names:

<p><pre>
    $90.00 - Tim Bunce
    $20.00 - Curtis Poe
    $10.00 - Unknown (I think it was someone from ActiveState)
</pre>

<p>Also Module::Build 0.27_XX fixes its --install_base locations.  MakeMaker has an INSTALLBASE (or INSTALL_BASE, haven't decided) which matches what 0.27 does, not 0.26.  So once Module::Build 0.28 is released I'll release a new version of MakeMaker that documents INSTALLBASE.  Then, finally, you can install MakeMaker and Module::Build based modules using the same method.  I strongly encourage the use of installbase over the <a href="http://www.pobox.com/user/schwern/talks/PREFIX/slides/slide001.html">fundamentally broken prefix</a>.</p>

Thanks, schwern!<br> <br>Actually, I've never used PREFIX, so this doesn't really impact me. But I do understand the frustration that can arise from constant grumbling. At least you'll be able to get those people off your back now.



<h2>Thank you!</h2>

<p>Not that I want it of course, but it'll stop the damn pointless arguments.

</p> <p>Actually, the pessimist in me says it won't - but y'have to hope.</p>



<h2>s{/local/}{/} if $debian</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grantm/">grantm</a> on 2005-06-22T02:02:32</h3>
<p>slide009.html of your presentation suggests that Debian puts stuff under<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/local.  On my debian system things look like this:</p>


prefix:<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr
modules:<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/share/perl5
programs:<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/bin
module docs:<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/share/man/man1
program docs:<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/share/man/man3


<p>I think<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/share/perl5 is only used for 'pure-Perl' modules.  Architecture-specific ones go under<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/lib/perl5</p> <p>

You're looking at the installation locations for core modules.  Most everything else goes into the "site" locations (installsitelib, installsitearch, etc...) which are under<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/local as they should be since its a locally installed widget.<br>

I'll see if I can dig up the names. No promises, though. Things got a little crazy near the end, what with you taking off your clothes and everything.

Three people contributed, and I had two of their names. Check your e-mail.

Schwern: thanks a lot for this. This will eliminate one of the most common reasons for choosing not to use Module::Build. And thanks to all the other people who did that.



<h2>Thank you!</h2>

Thanks to Schwern and the bounty bidders and Rob (for kickstart)

<p>As someone who is rebuilding Perl and Modules for internal distribution but NOT installing to "the" master place, this should make my life somewhat easier.</p>
