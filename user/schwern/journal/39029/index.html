<p>Some of you young whipper snappers might not even know about <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Coy">Coy</a>.  This is the module that introduced Damian Conway to the Perl community as the super genius he his.  It's a module that generates haiku based on error messages.<br/><br/><code>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w<br/><br/>use Coy;<br/><br/>open my $fh, "&lt;", "doesnotexist" or die "Can't open file: $!";
</code><br/><br/><code>
	-----
	Eshun departs near 
	the village. A pair of woodpeckers 
	nesting. Bankei.
	-----<br/><br/>		Eshun's commentary...
	
		Can't open file: No such file or directory <br/><br/>			("/Users/schwern/tmp/test.plx Speaks": line 5.)
</code><br/><br/>The American idea of a haiku is that its a 5/7/5 syllable arrangement.  So it must have a big dictionary of words and how many syllables they contain, right?  Wrong!  It has code to figure out how many syllables a word contains.  It can also hyphenate them, pluralize them and has a basic understanding of what words and concepts go together sensibly.  That's what makes it a Damian module.  You should read his <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/user/damian/TPC/1999/Coy/Presentation/">original presentation</a> on it if nothing else than to see presentation grand master Damian using <a href="http://bancomicsans.com/">Comic Sans</a>!  But really because the whole thing is in haiku.<br/><br/>What also makes it a Damian module is it hasn't been touched since 1999.  It contains a broken version of Lingua::EN::Inflect which overlays the separated CPAN version.  All that clever hyphenating code has never been documented or released or tested.  It needs love.<br/><br/>I asked Damian about it.  He offered it to me.  I can't even keep up with my own stuff so I declined... then I thought better and took it.  Its <a href="https://github.com/schwern/coy/tree">on github now</a>.  I've removed the busted Lingua::EN::Inflect, write some basic tests and will re-release once I get PAUSE perms fro Damian.  Lingua::EN::Hyphenate should be split out into its own release, if anyone is feeling their oats please take it.<br/><br/>This module is way too awesome to let die.</p>
