<div class="span8">
<p>The <a href="http://schwern.org/src/Method-Signatures-20081021.tar.gz">latest release of Method::Signatures</a> contains a big pile of bug fixes and a break through.<br/><br/>The bug fixes mostly relate to the handling of finding the end of the signature.  Various edge cases previously broke things like...<br/><br/><pre>
# Closing paren on its own line
method foo(
    $arg
)
{
    ...
}<br/><br/># Closing paren and opening block on the same line
method foo(
    $arg
) {
    ...
}
</pre><br/><br/>That's all fixed.<br/><br/>The other awesome part is a break through in how the signature parser works.  Previously it was just a pile of regexes doing and simple code like <code>split /\s*,\s*/, $signature</code> which broke on simple defaults like <code>$msg = "Hello, world!"</code>.  First I figured I could handle it with something like Text::Balanced, but that lead to writing a rudimentary Perl parser (and a pile of Text::Balanced bugs).  This violates the "no source filters" principle (and didn't work) so I scrapped that.<br/><br/>Then hdp suggested using PPI.  My first reaction was it's not applicable, after all the signature isn't Perl.  But PPI is just a tokenizer, and that's what I needed.  Something to tokenize my very Perl-like signature syntax.  Works like a charm.  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Method-Signatures/lib/Method/Signatures/Parser.pm">A very small parser using PPI</a> splits up the signature by walking through the tokens looking for commas while avoiding any child structures.  This is very robust and lets you pass in almost anything as a default.<br/><br/><pre>
method silly(
    $num    = 42,
    $string = q[Hello, world!],
    $hash   = { this => 42, that => 23 },
    $code   = sub { $num + 4 },
    @nums   = (1,2,3)
)
{
    ...
}
</pre><br/><br/>I'm just using PPI for splitting the list of parameters, but it works so well I may replace all the signature parser regexes with PPI.<br/><br/>This clears up the last of the major bugs under my control.  The debugger continues to be a show stopper, but I have to wait on Devel::Declare for that.</p>

<h2>PPI?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/educated_foo/">educated_foo</a> on 2008-10-21T16:01:14</h3>
<p>I'm not all that excited to see this requiring PPI.  It's really just a much better-tested hack rather than a solution, and IIRC (cpandeps is down) it pulls in half the world in dependencies.  What happens if you want to get Method::Signatures, or something like it, into core?  Default values are nice, but are they worth the complexity?</p>

<p>When it goes into core it doesn't go in as a module, it goes in as syntax.  No fucking around with PPI, the Perl parser gets patched.</p><p>And trust me, PPI is the least terrifying dependency Method::Signatures uses.  Its deps are shallow and mundane.  It's battle tested (Perl::Critic has been knocking it around for a long time), easy to figure out what the hell its doing and it does what it says on the tin.</p><p>Really, you should have seen what I was trying to do with Text::Balanced.  That was a swamp and it didn't even half work.</p>

<p>I agree.  PPI is solid.</p>
