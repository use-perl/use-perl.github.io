<p>I just noticed that back in January <a href="http://www.bungie.org">Bungie</a> released the <a href="http://trilogyrelease.bungie.org/">Marathon Trilogy</a> for free (beer).  Previously they had released the Marathon 2/Infinity engine for free (freedom) and it has since been developed for modern systems under the name <a href="http://source.bungie.org/">Aleph One</a>.  But the maps for Marathon were not available for download.  You had to own a copy of the game.  Since it was released in the mid 90s its a wee bit hard to find.  As its no longer available for sale Bungie decided to just give it away.  You want to download the complete "A1/SDL files" and then drop a copy of the Aleph One application into the resulting directory to get it going.  For Marathon 1 use the <a href="http://archives2.bungie.org/cgi-bin/findmaps.cgi?onmapname=on&mapname=m1a1+mac&sortby=date">M1A1 conversion</a>.

<p>For those who never played this game, and you probably haven't unless you were a Mac gamer in the mid 90s (a woe be unto you for that), its a contemporary of Doom yet far suprior in graphics, level design, gameplay and story.  Its a 3D shooter instead of the 2D (with a 3rd faked) of Doom.  The engine still holds up well, but its nothing compared to, say, Quake 3.  The engine isn't the point.  The point is the <a href="http://marathon.bungie.org/story">story</a>.

<h2>Marathon is connected to Halo.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Louis_Wu/">Louis_Wu</a> on 2005-08-23T20:18:27</h3>
And Halo is the reason I've got <a href="http://www.bungie.net/Games/Marathon/" title="bungie.net">Marathon</a bungie.net> sitting on my mac waiting for more copious free time.  Halo.bungie.org has a great story page <a href="http://halosm.bungie.org/story/marathon.html" title="bungie.org">speculating on connections</a bungie.org> between Halo and Marathon.
<p>
Oh, btw, Bungie is <a href="http://www.bungie.net/" title="bungie.net">Bungie.net</a bungie.net>.  From the bungie.org page:
<i>Bungie.org is an independently owned and operated fansite and is not affiliated with Bungie Studios.</i>  But Bungie_the_company really appreciates it's fans, as you can see when their <a href="http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=greathollywoodjourney1" title="bungie.net">front page news articles</a bungie.net> link back to Bungie_the_fans.  (The link at the bottom of the article is to a bungie.org hosted comic.)</p>
