<div class="span8">
<p>I recently retrained my spam filters (sa-learn) by the simple expedient of pulling down about three weeks worth of mail and hand sorting it.  It came out something like this:<br/><br/>Ham:   960 messages ~6 megs
Spam: 4100 messages ~120 megs<br/><br/>Out of the ham there was about 50 I actually kept to read.  The rest was mailing list threads I wasn't particularly interested in.<br/><br/>Realize this is *after* my mail is filtered through pobox.com's RBL-based filtering.  That knocks out between 5000 to 10,000 messages a month (6700 in the last 30 days).<br/><br/>I always assume I get an uncommonly large amount of spam.  My address is over six years old and is posted all over the Internet via mailing lists and Perl documentation.  This is why I usually scoff when someone suggests "just use foo.com's built-in filtering" whenever my email toolchain has a hiccup.<br/><br/>Do other folks see this much crap?<br/><br/>
PS  If you ever need to hand filter a large amount of email, sorting by subject helps a lot.</p>

<p>Clever<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p><p>Meanwhile, when do you plan on reading (and answering) those 50 messages? (I sent you an email, but I don't know if it got through...)</p>

<a href="http://www.mutt.org/" title="mutt.org">mutt</a mutt.org> is exceptionally good at this sort of thing, thanks to its mini-language for retrieving mail information.  In combination with the <tt>l</tt>imit command the <tt>D</tt>elete command, it rocks for killing unwanted messages.  And it's damned fast to boot.

Its possible it got dropped on the floor while I was fixing things up.  Resend to be sure.

<p>Yep. Since January 1st I've got about 12,000 emails in my caughtspam folder. I <i>really</i> need to implement some kind of SMTP-time blocking mechanism.</p>

I get about 2,000 spam messages a day, which includes a lot of the same messages sent to every address for The Perl Review as well as my Stonehenge address and the Panix address that I've had for 8 years and don't bother to obfuscate or munge (here it is spammers -&gt; comdog@panix.com -&gt; I won't see your message though).

<p>I don't think 960 ham messages in three weeks is a common figure. I probably get a fifth of that.</p>

<p>Going by your numbers, though, you have a spam:ham ratio of 10:1, and I'd say that yes, that's pretty common. It's certainly close to what I'm getting.</p>

You must not subscribe to many lists.  Schwern's number is only 45 ham messages a day, so you're only getting 9?  I probably get 2000 ham messages in 3 weeks, maybe more, most of it mailing list traffic and some automated messages.  Of course the vast majority of that gets filtered into folders and deleted with only a glance at the subject line.  I doubt that 960 is out of the ordinary for geeks.

I lost my perspective here, put as 45mails/day it's not that much. I don't have much email traffic, but I do have a huge blogroll. Newsfeeds have the advantage of being a spam-free medium so far.

<h2>200 spam messages a day</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2005-02-08T15:32:41</h3>
I get about 200 spam messages a day, but I don't have a domain of my own. This is just on my normal everyday email address. Just a few months ago it was "only" half that much.
<p>I fear that, when I go on holiday for a few weeks, my normal mailbox will just overflow. The sheer bulk of it is just too much for even the multi-megabytes mailbox I have at my disposal.</p>
