<p>If you live in Pittsburgh and do own a car come Feburary <a href="http://www.portauthority.org/fares/pagFareScene.asp">you are DOOMED!</a>  8 million trips formerly made on buses will now have to be made in cars.  But you're already doomed, traffic in this city is horrid as it is.

<p><a href="http://www.portauthority.org">PAT</a> did not get the funding it needs this year and are planning to raise fares and slash schedules come Feburary.  The current proposal is to jack the base price from $1.75 to $2.50 while <a href="http://www.portauthority.org/fares/pagEliminate.asp">eliminating some routes</a> along with weekend, holiday and night service resulting in a <a href="http://www.portauthority.org/fares/pagServiceProp.asp">31% decrease in service</a>.  Now, I don't have an MBA but doesn't cutting back services while increasing prices usually just make things go from bad to worse?

<p>And I'm not an accountant but I can <a href="http://www.portauthority.org/fares/pagFareScene.asp">read a table</a> and it seems to me the optimum strategy here is to raise the price but not reduce service.

<p>Anyhow, come New Year's I'm blowing this pierogi stand.</p>

Surely a bus isn't the <a href="http://www.bromptonbicycle.co.uk/" title="bromptonbicycle.co.uk"> <em>only</em> </a bromptonbicycle.co.uk> alternative to a car?

Aren't those the things that randomly collapse in the street, dumping their riders under busses?

And you guys should have seen the accident *I* had with a bicycle, a couple of years ago!<br> <br>And there weren't even any busses involved!!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-|

Um, no.  But you don't have to get a folding bike; I just think they're a damned good idea.

Unfortunately that's not a serious alternative in Pittsburgh. Bicycle infrastructure is just awful around here.

<p>And even if it weren't it would be difficult for non-athletes to ride in the area due to all the hills.

</p><p>And even if we didn't have the hills (and rivers) the continuous expansion of jobs to the suburbs would probably make your commute too long.

</p><p>And even your commute weren't too long there are ~3-4 months of the year where riding a bike would be nearly impossible due to the weather (snow and such).</p>

People keep telling me that Brighton has bad bicycle infrastructure.  However, I find that roads which are jammed with slow moving vehicles enable you to manouvre your bicycle even quicker.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>OTOH, snow and bicycles definitely do not mix.  I have enough troubles with road furniture in the wet...
