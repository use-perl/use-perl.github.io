<h2>That's kind of weird...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rooneg/">rooneg</a> on 2004-10-17T04:05:36</h3>
I don't know what's making it so slow for you, but that's certainly not what I'm seeing here on OS X.<br> <br>$ time svn --version &gt;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/dev/null<br>real    0m0.130s<br>user    0m0.060s<br>sys     0m0.000s<br> <br>What version of svn are you using, just out of curiosity?  And can you perhaps try and get a handle on what it's doing?  Perhaps some ktrace output?



<h2>something else...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lachoy/">lachoy</a> on 2004-10-17T04:30:01</h3>
It's probably something else; on my OS X (svn: 1.05) I got:<blockquote><div> <tt>shazam:~ cwinters$ time svn --version &gt;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/dev/null<br> <br>real&nbsp; &nbsp; 0m0.066s<br>user&nbsp; &nbsp; 0m0.050s<br>sys&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0m0.020s<br>shazam:~ cwinters$ time cvs --version &gt;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/dev/null<br> <br>real&nbsp; &nbsp; 0m0.091s<br>user&nbsp; &nbsp; 0m0.000s<br>sys&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0m0.020s</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>My only use of svn has been on win32. There I found that for everything except checking out it was as fast or faster than cvs. Checking out an SVN branch is remarkably slow, but you only take the hit once.

</p><p>Having 'svn status' and 'svn diff' that don't have to go out to the repository to get information is excellent.

</p><p>I'm hesitant to move from CVS though because at least in the 1.0 series svn used Berkeley DB; I've had BDB storage corrupt more often than filesystems and it's not worth the pain. I heard svn 1.1+ allows you to store in the filesystem though...</p>



<h2>slow version</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gabor/">gabor</a> on 2004-10-17T09:42:14</h3>
There was some discussion on the subversion users mailing list of the slowness of some of the recent versions. While I am not sure it is related to what you are experiencing I read it is going to be fixed soon.



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:slow version</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rooneg/">rooneg</a> on 2004-10-17T14:27:14</h3>
The slowness that was discussed on the list was related to the operation that underlies the 'svn list' command, and only when used over the ra_dav ra layer.  It'll be fixed in 1.1.1, which should be out in the next day or so, the fix was already released as part of 1.0.9 if you're still using the 1.0.x series of releases.<br> <br>That said, that problem has nothing to do with what he's seeing here.

<h2>IPV6?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/phillup/">phillup</a> on 2004-10-20T01:23:33</h3>
Check and make sure your system isn't trying to use IPV6 for name resolution. It can slow down the first connection to a system (even localhost).<br> <br>Does it give the same speed difference if you do them in reverse order?
