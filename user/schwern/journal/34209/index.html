<p>Every few days I see someone lamenting that they posted a bug on rt.cpan.org a few months back and never got a response.  Sometimes the author just ignored it, but sometimes I look and the bug was entered in February or March of this year. What's special about those months is rt.cpan.org was having trouble sending out mail for new bugs during that period.<br/><br/>Ticket reporters, what you can do is just reply to an ignored ticket with a simple, polite reminder message.  "Ping?" is fine or "I didn't get a response, did you get this ticket?  It's important to me."  Do it for any ticket that's been dropped on the floor, not just blackout tickets.<br/><br/>Authors, check your queues for bugs created in February and March; see if you missed anything.</p>

<h2>thanks for the reminder</h2>

I was severely afflicted by that blackout, and I sometimes lose tickets to SpamAssassin.  Because rt.cpan.org lacks the (vital, imho) ability to list "all tickets on all queues I admin, I wrote this script to find all the bugs for the dists I care for:  <a href="http://rjbs.manxome.org/hacks/perl/bugagg" title="manxome.org">http://rjbs.manxome.org/hacks/perl/bugagg</a manxome.org><br><br>I should update it to use one of the better APIs offered by RT at some point, but it works, and helps me notice bugs that email didn't get to me.
