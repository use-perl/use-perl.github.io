<h1>Talking with Alan Burlison about Perl v PHP, Solaris v Linux</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>Last night on <a href="irc://irc.perl.org/#p5p">#p5p</a> Alan Burlison talked about how Perl is viewed inside Sun.  Alan is a Perl 5 Porter from way back and is deeply involved with dynamic languages at Sun.  He talked about how Solaris is currently struggling to reshape itself after losing lots of ground to Linux and the parallels this has with Perl vs PHP and Ruby.<br/><br/>It wasn't a formal interview by any means, just a late night IRC bitch session.  I've <a href="http://schwern.org/user/schwern/tmp/%23p5p_with_alan.txt">posted the whole conversation</a> (don't think anybody minds, it is a public channel and there's good stuff in there).  Here's some highlights.<br/><br/><pre>
<alanbur> They care about being able to do things quickly, not how they are
done.  PHP is proof of that
<alanbur> Web2.0 types
<Schwern> I was musing about PHP.  I think PHP has something we lost, and
that is that its ok to be sloppy.
<alanbur> I subscribe to a local mailing list of web designers and
developers.  It's been interesting - virtually *all* the conversation i about
either ROR or PHP.  perl has never even come up.
</pre><br/><br/><pre>
<alanbur> Perl stared off with a massive head start in the webworld - it was
*the* de-facto langiage for CGI, it integrated really well with Apache.  What
happened, and why?
</pre><br/><br/><pre>
<alanbur> I see close parallels between the problems we had to address with
Solaris when confronted by Linux and the problems perl has.
<alanbur> Any of these sound familiar:
<alanbur> 1. Being displaced by a new kid on the block who has inferior
technology
<alanbur> 2. Losing you place on CS teaching courses
<alanbur> 3. Concentrating mainly on existing users rather than obtaining new ones
<Schwern> I don't understand #2.
<Schwern> My place?
<alanbur> Do people teach your stuff in CS courses?
<Schwern> No, but they never did.  However, I see your point.
<alanbur> 4. Valuing technical beauty over pragmatic usefulness
<alanbur> 5. Concentration on solving existing problems rather than new ones
</pre></p>

They are part of a (now) well-known business pattern.  Read <i>The Innovator's Dilemma</i> or its follow-up <i>The Innovator's Solution</i>.<p>

I'd never thought of applying the theory to programming languages.  But it fits.  Some of the pressures documented in <i>The Innovator's Solution</i> to pay close attention to existing customers apply in the case of Perl as well if you interpret them just right.  The pricing part is not quite as good a fit, but it is close.</p><p>

However I've long said, if you want to improve the visibility of Perl, create a way for Perl to be used conveniently in shared hosting environments with reasonable performance.  That's the big thing that PHP does that Perl does not.  If you want to get someone to host your website and you're a cheapskate, you have a choice.  Use PHP, or use CGI.  Faced with that choice, lots of people start with PHP then never look back.</p>

There are different paths to success.  Java's path involves having a large marketing machine and significant corporate sponsors.  There is no mystery there, but it isn't an example that Perl looks like it will duplicate soon.<br><br>PHP's success is along a line that is closer to how Perl grew.  Historically Perl was the language that people used for small and personal web projects, which sometimes grew up.  That's how a lot of Perl projects started, and a lot of Perl people began learning the language.  (Including me.  I was working for a small company in 1997 that told me, "We're doing well with personal Access applications, but we need to explore this web thing.  Learn Perl and teach us about it.")  But Perl no longer has that position - PHP does.  It is worth wondering how PHP wound up in the niche that Perl was in, and worth wondering whether Perl could become more competitive in that niche.

Maybe the foundation should raise some money and hire a PR company for perl5 and perl6. Do some marketing of the language, its benefits and such. It benefits all of us Perl coders. <br> <br><br/><br/>Also, I've been thinking that maybe the foundation should take a role in helping to develop Perl businesses (consulting companies, web apps, etc...). I'm not quite sure what type of role it should take, maybe PR is good place to start, maybe something like barcamp but for Perl folks, maybe put together angel investors and selling them on the Perl community. Maybe connecting folks trying to start business with people, resources and such. I'm not entirely sure what that pictures looks like but once again more companies using Perl benefit the community. And the very smart folks in the community would (and have) benefit young companies.<br> <br><br/><br/>Just some quick thoughts.

<h2>Sun had other problems</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2007-09-08T00:28:47</h3>
Well, I know why Sun lost out. They were overpriced and had poor customer support. I worked at two companies that had the high level support with them, and it was always a pain to get them to actually provide that support (as in, come out and replace the power supplies in my machines like you are supposed to). I liked Solaris well enough, but with Sun's non-technical problems, going with FreeBSD on Dell was just easier to manage because Sun wasn't the bottleneck in support and replacement hardware.<br><br>I don't think Perl has those problems, so it's not the same thing at all for the customer. Perl might have other problems, but Sun wasn't acting like a good vendor to people who really wanted to use them.

<h2>Web 2.0: Yahoo Pipes?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vek/">vek</a> on 2007-09-08T02:49:06</h3>
Interesting conversation.  Regarding Perl not being on anyone's Web 2.0 radar, I could have sworn Yahoo Pipes used Perl heavily.  Not sure how popular Pipes is these days but it did create some measure of Web 2.0 buzz when it came out.  Odd that it's never mentioned whenever Perl's lack of Web 2.0 presence is brought up.

This makes Perl even less visible which makes it even less sexy which gives them even less incentive...<br><br>Perception-wise it doesn't matter how much cool shit is written in Perl if nobody knows about it.  There's huge companies writing huge amounts of critical software in Perl out there and they don't tell anyone.

Insisting on staying compatible with technology which is simply too old?  Maybe the 5.5 compatibility habit was developed when 5.6 came out.

And PHP wins because 99% of the works of Shakespeare are valid code.<br><br>There's also the fact that perl is the "strong, silent type", and the bit where PHP was an easy-to-install templating language.

<p>How dare you use a feature as simple and nice as lexical filehandles in a CPAN module, you <em>fascist</em>!  It is my right as someone who demonstratably does not upgrade to have the option to upgrade to code written this millennium, you pig!</p>



<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/schwern/">schwern</a> on 2007-09-09T00:18:27</h3>
WRT compatibility, it will be interesting to see from the results of the <a href="http://perlsurvey.org/" title="perlsurvey.org">Perl Survey</a perlsurvey.org> how many people still use the older versions we're so slavishly adhering to.



<h2>The fight of old versus new</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ferreira/">ferreira</a> on 2007-09-10T11:48:17</h3>
If ExtUtils::MakeMaker still got the upper hand on Module::Build like CPAN does compared to CPANPLUS, it's because they work flawlessly (if you accept its quirks).

<p>
I believe the greater problems with M::B and CPANPLUS is one of resistance, not enough feedback for authors, and maybe lack of developers' time (like in the recent thread discussing Parrot). They are supposed to be better than their counterparts, but they are not there yet.

</p><p>
The support for EU::MM is omniscient. The support for M::B is not there sometimes. For example, chris' smoke servers report failures on modules that only provides Build.PL scripts. That means you can't get rid of the compatibility concerns (no matter what).

</p><p>
The case of CPAN and CPANPLUS looks different. CPAN keeps getting better incrementally thanks to the work by Andreas. It has some subtle advantages that many can think it does not make difference, but it does. For example, CPAN is a memory-expensive application which can be improved in this aspect by CPAN::SQLite. CPANPLUS is an even larger memory hog (without remedy). That means in a under-powered machine, you go with CPAN. And many of these machines run in many places.

</p><p>
The whole point of my entry is that you can't promote the compatibility break when you don't have yet adequate replacements for the old tools people grew used to.</p>

<p>Not to my knowledge.

<p>Not at all, but I think it&#8217;s an orthogonal issue. Ease of installation is a toolchain problem; Perl 6 is a language, not a toolchain. However, I agree that it needs to <em>have a</em> toolchain that&#8217;s good enough. There has been some grunting that &#8220;we&#8217;ll make that work&#8221;, but no concrete design has happened.</p>

<p>Personally, I think that&#8217;s just as well, since the Perl 5 toolchain is suboptimal anyway, and anything we do for Perl 5 will be roughly applicable to Perl 6 as well, particularly if we get a working pure-Perl toolchain &#8211; read: if we get Module::Build up to snuff. Then IMO it&#8217;s mostly a matter of porting the Perl 5 toolchain to Perl 6.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll cross that bridge when we get to it. For now I think we urgently need to fix the Perl 5 toolchain.</p>

<p>Most importantly the circular dependency issue: AFAIK we don&#8217;t have the tooling in place yet by which the CPAN client could upgrade Module::Build before running <code>Build.PL</code>, when a newer version is necessary.</p>

<p>I also remember reading mentions of other issues I&#8217;m only vaguely aware of anymore and couldn&#8217;t list. None of them sounded unfixable, most in fact benign. I think building XS modules with Module::Build needed more polish? My understanding was that more work was needed to make it really solid, but work was progressing apace, and so I didn&#8217;t worry enough to look very closely.</p>

<p>The circular dependency issue is the important one, and the one I care about (and it extends beyond Module::Build, so many more cogs to fix to make it work). It&#8217;s the one thing I consider broken with all of the CPAN toolchain options we currently have.</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re: toolchain</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Eric Wilhelm/">Eric Wilhelm</a> on 2007-09-10T18:15:31</h3>
It is not a circular dependency.  Module::Build builds itself just fine.<br><br>It *is* a configure-dependency issue.  The cpan clients now (I think) handle configure_requires properly, so the next release of Module::Build should seal the deal.

To go off topic a bit...<br><br>It hasn't been relicensed yet to my knowledge.  <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/opensource/" title="movabletype.org">They're wibbling about it.</a movabletype.org>  "Before we released an open source version of Movable Type we wanted to engage with the community regarding its development and scope."  What a complete waste of time and energy.  What's to talk about, JUST RELEASE IT!<br><br>Just you watch, they're going to write their own license.  I can smell it.<br><br>Let me make some sweeping generalizations...<br><br>Commercial software dumped onto the open source world acts very differently than true open source software.  The community development is often very weak to non-existent at the start and remains weak because employees at the company have a commanding position (it's not a meritocracy).  It's often optimized for big (read: dumb) company's IT departments and paid-for installs.<br><br>I'm currently using both Wordpress and Movable Type.  Wordpress wins on backend usability hands down.  The admin web interface is a dream.  There's tons and tons of themes and a plugin out there for everything you might need.<br>

Movable Type 4's admin interface has had a complete overhaul and is rather lovely now.  MT has a shed load of plugins too.  Themes however, yes, Wordpress wins on number of themes by a mile.

<p><blockquote> <div><i>I'm interested in the statement that is perl not a contender in Web-2.0. I thought there was lots of CPAN stuff that could be considered Web-2.0</i></div> </blockquote>


<p>How about <a href="http://www.openguides.org/" title="openguides.org">OpenGuides</a openguides.org>? I haven't seen a *single* other wiki with structured metadata (based on Wiki::Toolkit from the CPAN) and a geo-locational focus. Hell even Tim Berners-Lee said it was cool (I can find the irclog somewhere I'm sure<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...)

</p><p>But OpenGuides has the same publicity issues as the rest of Perl I suppose. A dozen or so people actively work in the community, probably a few hundred more in the world support their local guide. Simply nobody knows about it.</p>

"How to advertise your web project" is something to be figured out.  Here's one way... try searching for it and similar projects.  Then do whatever it takes to make yourself visible to the Web 2.0.  Go to the various social bookmarking sites (delicious and Digg) and get yourself on there.  Put up a blog about the site and get it linked to Technorati.  Register your project on Ohloh.<br><br>Also it would be nice if the site mentioned Perl somewhere.

<p>I'd forgotten about Freebase, OpenGuides pre-dates it by several years (I started my guide in early 2004, and I heard about the software in 2003 at YAPC::EU) and has been alone for so long I'll have to revise my rant now.</p><p><blockquote> <div><em>Also it would be nice if the site mentioned Perl somewhere.</em></div> </blockquote>

<p>Wow, I hadn't even noticed it wasn't in there. It is mentioned on <a href="http://openguides.org/page/software" title="openguides.org">http://openguides.org/page/software</a openguides.org> but I'll see about getting someone to plug it into the front page too.</p>

Yep, the OpenGuides website needs an overhaul; first it needs to move to the same server as all our Trac stuff.  I've sent mail to the person responsible for this, but I don't know when he'll get back to me and even when he does I'm a bit overwhelmed at the moment.  But thanks very much for pointing it out; we should definitely mention Perl on the front page.
