<p>Switching from fink to DarwinPorts because fink has gotten rather out of date.  So far I'm finding the ports utility quite inferior to fink/apt.<br/><br/>* Install starts installing dependencies without asking or even telling you what its about to do (for example, I asked it to install subversion and now its installing apr).<br/><br/>* Uninstall does not appear to have any option for "uninstall this and all its dependencies".  When you try to uninstall something with deps it only tells you its first depenency.<br/><br/>* When you do say "port uninstall thing things_dependency" it still complains that thing has a dependency on things_dependency.  You appear to have to manually uninstall in the correct order.<br/><br/>* No binary install.  I don't relish the idea of compiling a bazillion packages from source.  Sometimes I want my software NOW!<br/><br/>* The GUI, Port Authority, keeps trying to sell you its Aqua version.  You have to search around quite a bit to find the free, precompiled version.  And its X11 only.  Also it sucks.  I can't select more than one package at a time.  And it asks for my password over and over again.  What the hell?<br/><br/>* I installed port's perl5.8.  Then I installed p5-pathtools.  I had to force it to overlay Cwd.pm.  Then I uninstalled p5-pathtools... and it didn't put perl5.8's Cwd.pm back so I'm left with a broken perl5.8.<br/><br/>* They don't archive ports' source code so the availability of a given port is dependent on each download URL not changing and the individual server not going down.  Which is to say not terribly good availability.<br/><br/>fink was written in Perl so I had a chance to patch it up (and did).  port is written in TCL.  TEE CEE ELLLLLLLLL!!!<br/><br/>Here's what has made me decide to run screaming back to fink (its a good thing I didn't delete /sw).<br/><br/>* ports installed GNU coreutils but prepending a "g" in front of every program.  gchmod.  gdate.  ghostname.  gls!!!

I agree about dp. Although I used it only to get Ruby and subversion onto my iBook.<br><br>As for Tcl...so? Tcl is a nice little language. Has its quirks but so does Perl. They are even adding OO to the core in the next release. I use it for small gui utilities myself. Tcl has come a long way, just as Perl has.<br><br>

<p>Tcl is nice roughly in the way Perl 4 was nice. I wouldn&#x2019;t do much bigger things with Tcl than I would with bash, or would have with Perl 4.</p>
