<p>I spent most of YAPC::NA mildly sick, sleep deprived and writing talks.  Each of those things alone isn't so bad, but put all together meant I had time and energy enough to do my talks, discuss with people after, and that's about it.  As a result, I was kind of dead in the head most of the time and didn't do a whole lot of interaction with people.  I didn't feel like I got the most out of the one opportunity a year I get to hang out with huge gobs of Perl folk.<br/><br/>One of the things which I wanted to do at YAPC was get <a href="http://gitpan.integra.net">gitpan</a> restarted.  It can run right now, but the code is a mess and needs to be babied.  It needs a rewrite.  That rewrite was supposed to happen at YAPC but see above.  I'm doing that now, using MooseX::Declare, perl5i and Path::Class just to mess around with them seriously.  Also log4perl, which I'm finally learning a decade late.  Its fun, far more pleasant than knocking it together without, once you learn to cope with Moose's idiosyncrasies.  Better to learn the quirks of one complete system than nine incomplete ones.<br/><br/>That's what's absorbing my time right now.  After that I want to add subroutine signatures to perl5i and the <a href="http://piratepad.net/ULub7Vjsgn">ÃÂ¼ber file and directory objects</a>.  They were supposed to be in, at least as a prototype, by YAPC but that didn't work out.  Using MooseX::Declare, Path::Class and perl5i together has me drooling for them.<br/><br/>Will Coleda, representing the TPF, found me at YAPC and mercifully did not break my legs.  We hashed out a plan to make a last stab at Test::Builder2 before calling the grant done.  That's not going to happen until August, I'll post about that later.<br/><br/>Oh, and I have a talk to do at OSCON about how <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/14113">the world is going to end in 2038</a> assuming <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW2qxFkcLM0">2012 doesn't claim the prize first</a>.  And a two part <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/proposals/420">Git tutorial for Drupal programmers</a> that I'm developing into a commercial class.  And two paid clients to keep happy.<br/><br/>One thing I *don't* have to worry about is MakeMaker.  Gird your loins, MakeMaker has provisionally been handed off to Matt Trout.  Maybe I need to worry about it more...</p>
