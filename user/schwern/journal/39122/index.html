<p>I signed on at <a href="http://yapc10.org">YAPC</a> to do a talk simply entitled <a href="http://yapc10.org/yn2009/talk/1960">Trapped In A Room With Schwern</a>.  Robert Blackwell said this of what he wants:<br/><br/><blockquote>
"I think you have a nice bent/slant/angle etc on a lot of stuff. I want you to get people talking. And no I would not expect every talk to be about perl. It would make me sad if they were all perl. But if you do it I would hope you could get everyone in the room to get excited about something. And I hope you would bore the crap out of others. Why do I think that b/c your audience is everyone from Larry to noob. You are not going to shock both of them or bore both of them with the same stuff."
</blockquote><br/><br/>I have a goldfish's memory for what's interesting to me.  As I'm writing up a list of things to talk about, I'm thinking that I'm missing something really obvious that I've simply forgotten about or that seems old and obvious to me.<br/><br/>So, suggestions?  What would people like to hear about?  Perl or otherwise.  What do I tend to babble animatedly about between sessions?</p>

<h2>Talk about Selenium and browser testing</h2>

I'd love to hear more about your last two posts (testing with Selenium). Since it's fresh and you're new to it, I'm guessing there's a window of opportunity where your fresh eyes can deliver a good perspective on getting up and running.
