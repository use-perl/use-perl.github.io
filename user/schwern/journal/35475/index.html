<div class="span8">
<p>I was about to write up a module that exports lots of functions.  It's for testing purposes to create interesting, semi-random, complicated objects for testing which I refer as "The Sims" -- in the "let's create people and then throw them into a torturous environment and see how they react" sense.<br/><br/>Anyhow, it's going to export a huge pile of sim_* functions (whether or not that's a good idea is immaterial).  I don't want to have to remember to update an @EXPORT variable dissociated from declaring the function.  I'm going to forget.  The obvious answer would seem to be to make exporting an attribute of the subroutine.  And that's just what <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Exporter-Simple">Exporter::Simple</a> does.  Unfortunately it <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=7708">doesn't really work</a> and there doesn't appear to be an easy fix.<br/><br/>So... 
* Is there an existing module that works and does what I want?
* If not, can Exporter::Simple be fixed?
* If not, could you write an Export-by-attribute system that does work?
* If not, could you write something that allows the export information to be conveniently placed near the subroutine?</p>

<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2008-01-25T01:59:26</h3>
* Is there an existing module that works and does what I want?<br><br>Probably not, exporting is such a fundamental task that Export modules tend to be relatively back-compatible, and as such don't use attributes.<br><br>* If not, can Exporter::Simple be fixed?<br><br>If it involves changing it's Perl minimum version, no.<br><br>* If not, could you write an Export-by-attribute system that does work?<br><br>Quite probably.<br><br>I mean, it's just a case of a "use Attribute::Export;" setting the module to @ISA Exporter, creating the @EXPORT variable, and then having the attibute handler append the name to @EXPORT/@EXPORT_OK.<br><br>* If not, could you write something that allows the export information to be conveniently placed near the subroutine?<br><br>You mean like...<br><br>push @EXPORT, qw{function};<br>sub function {<br><br>}<br><br>If you aren't using attributes, you might as well just do that.<br><br>But I'd go down the attribute route.<br><br>Just beware you lose 5.6 support that way, so make sure that doesn't matter.<br>

I think Adam's solution (push onto @EXPORT) is pretty nice and simple, as far as things that deal with attributes can be.  It's exactly what I would've suggested, although I probably would've built atop Sub::Exporter.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br><br>I'll be interested to hear/see what you end up doing.

<h2>A quick and dirty suggestion</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grantm/">grantm</a> on 2008-01-25T06:42:21</h3>
<p>If in fact your module simply needs to "<i>export a huge pile of sim_* functions</i>", then one solution would be to write your own <code>import()</code> sub that scans your package's symbol table hash and exports every sub with a name that matches<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>/^sim_/</code>.</p>



<h2>Perl6::Export</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hanekomu/">hanekomu</a> on 2008-01-25T09:04:52</h3>
<p>I'm the author of Exporter::Simple. It has some other bugs as well, and there's, like you said, no simple fix. Maybe Damian's Perl6::Export does what you want? The only thing - as far as I can remember - that Exporter::Simple does additionally is to be able to export variables, which Damian says is evil anyway. If Perl6::Export works better, then I was planning to deprecate Exporter::Simple.</p>



<h2>Sub::Exporter + Class::MOP for the win!</h2>

Well to start with, please please please make sure it's based on Sub::Exporter and not Exporter.pm. And as for basing it on attributes, I don't think that is a plus. Attributes are poorly implemented with a poor API to use them. They give you just enough power to think you can do something cool with them, and then fall short (IMO at least).

<p>
Okay, that said, here is a modified version of a <a href="http://code2.0beta.co.uk/moose/svn/MooseX-Exporter/trunk/" title="0beta.co.uk">proof of concept</a 0beta.co.uk> module I did recently that mixed Moose roles and Sub::Exporter. It should do the trick for exporting all <code>^sim_*</code> functions without having to repeat yourself in @EXPORT or in attributes.</p><p><blockquote> <div><tt>package Export::Only::What::I::Want;<br> <br>use strict;<br>use warnings;<br> <br>use Class::MOP;<br>use Sub::Exporter;<br> <br>sub import {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; shift;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my ($regexp) = @_;<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $pkg = caller();<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $pkg_meta = Class::MOP::Class-&gt;initialize($pkg);<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $pkg_meta-&gt;alias_method(import =&gt; Sub::Exporter::build_exporter(<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exports =&gt; {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; map {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $_ =&gt; $pkg_meta-&gt;get_method($_)-&gt;body<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } grep {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/$regexp/<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } $pkg_meta-&gt;get_method_list<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; },<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; groups&nbsp; =&gt; { default =&gt; [':all'] }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; )<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; );<br>}</tt></div> </blockquote> You would then use it in your module like so<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<p><blockquote> <div><tt>package Foo;<br> <br>use Export::Only::What::I::Want qr/^foo_/;<br> <br>sub foo_bar { 'Foo::foo_bar' }<br>sub bar_foo { 'Foo::bar_foo' }</tt></div> </blockquote> And whalla...<p><blockquote> <div><tt>package Bar;<br>use Foo;<br># Bar::foo_bar exists, but no Bar::bar_foo<nobr> <wbr></nobr>..</tt></div> </blockquote>

use export bar =&gt; sub {...};<br><br>What I haven't figured out yet is how to get an automatic unimport() call without userland $^H.<br><br>I'm convinced that it shouldn't involve Attribute::Handlers or anything else messing with UNIVERSAL::* (or @UNIVERSAL::ISA, eek!) and/or inheritance (certainly not inheritance of Exporter.pm.)<br><br>It could use attributes, probably by injecting compile-time MODIFY_type_ATTRIBUTES methods into your package, but it looks like something like 'no Exporter::NoReally' would be required to finish things (because the sub name doesn't get passed and I don't want to have an INIT block.)
