<p>You may know <a href="http://www.spidereyeballs.com/">Julian Cash</a> as <a href="http://www.spidereyeballs.com/os6/">that guy</a> <a href="http://www.spidereyeballs.com/os2000/">who takes the</a> <a href="http://www.spidereyeballs.com/os5/">cool OSCON photos</a>.  Which is enough to qualify for genius.<br/><br/>But that's not enough, oh no.<br/><br/>The fucker mailed me <a href="http://www.pobox.com/user/schwern/img/Julian%20mailed%20me%20a%20ball%202.jpg">a ball</a>.<br/><br/>No packaging.  No box.  Just a ball.<br/><br/>He stamped and addressed <a href="http://www.pobox.com/user/schwern/img/Julian%20mailed%20me%20a%20ball%201.jpg">a ball</a>.<br/><br/>INGENIOUS!<br/><br/>And if you look closely, the address is written backwards on the opposite side.  You have to look through the ball to read it.<br/><br/>DOUBLE GENIUS!<br/><br/>(Also, I love the USPS for delivering a ball)

<h2>Julian's balls</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2006-07-12T01:11:16</h3>
He mailed me one, too!
<p>
I went to the PO box and found the key to the locker, figuring it was some O'Reilly giveaways or something.  And I went and opened it, and there's a ball in there that barely fit.  It's crazy!
</p><p>
He is crazy insane!</p>

I thought it was wonderful.  Mine looked rather different than Schwerns, so I am curious to see yours (too).  I'll post pictures tomorrow...

Oh yes, it's wonderful.  Please don't think that "insane" is the opposite of "wonderful"!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>Balls all around</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/delegatrix/">delegatrix</a> on 2006-07-12T03:26:13</h3>
We got one, too.  ziggy can post a picture.  And a lucite block last month.  Who expects to find a beach ball with stamps (cancelled!) stuck to it sitting on your doorstep?  Weirdest. Mail. Ever.  That Julian . . .

<h2>I got a *dinosaur* from Julian</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/zrusilla/">zrusilla</a> on 2009-01-26T03:35:16</h3>
My nine-year-old son was hugely amused by this.  We were discussing who might've done this. I mentioned that I had a friend in college who wrote and mailed herself letters from Kristy McNichol and said, "There's a lot of weird people in the world."
<p>
"Some people attract them more than others," said his dad, flashing me a glance.
</p><p>
My son stops. He looks at me, he looks at his dad, he looks at me, he looks at his dad, he looks at me, he looks at his dad.
</p><p>
His dad says, "Hey! What are you trying to say?"
</p><p>
My son and I bust out laughing and we high-fived.</p>

Seriously, I was freaked out when I opened the mail box and saw a lizard.  Then when I saw its stamp collar I knew what was going on.
