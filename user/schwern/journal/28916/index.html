<p>(EDIT:  Don't know of EVE Online?  <a href="http://www.eve-online.com/files/pcgamer_eve.pdf">This article</a> sums things up nicely.)<br/><br/>In order to top my mistake of signing up for World of Warcraft I recently signed up for <a href="http://eve-online.com/">EVE</a>.  Warcraft was getting too repetative and simplistic.  I'm sick of the hand holding.  Its too easy.  EVE offers a much higher level of complexity, player control and open ended gaming.  Combat?  Mining?  Trading?  CEO?  Spy?  Con-man?  Scientist?  Trader?  Manufacturing?  Explorer?  Bounty hunter?  Whatever you want.  No classes.  No levels and experience points (and thus no grinding or level cap).  A player controlled market.  Player built space stations, ships.  Player controlled star systems.  And if your ship gets destroyed... well, hope you had insurance.<br/><br/>I'm also sick of learning I have friends who play WoW only to find they're on a different server shard.  The fractured universe is, I think, Warcraft's biggest drawback.  EVE has just one universe.  15-20k people playing together at any given time, largest ever.  This, plus the much steeper learning curve, I think makes the EVE community a tad more mature.<br/><br/>So... anyone play EVE?  Its a big black out there and its a big, complex game to learn.  I'm on as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stainless_Steel_Rat">Stainless Rat</a> (just as soon as I put my PC back together).<br/><br/>And its <a href="http://www.eve-online.com/faq/faq_07.asp">written in Stackless Python</a>!  Wow!  An enormous, graphic intensive PC game, client and server, written in a dynamic language.  Gives me hope, folks.

Heh... I've been playing the game since october, and think it's pretty cool. Haven't thought of looking for Perlites though.<br><br>Send me a message if you want to join a corporation ingame! I'm in as "Ford Hakata".<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br>

Well, there goes any hope of seeing ExtUtil::Install in this lifetime<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

The nice thing about EVE is its very low intensity.  Lots of time spent on autopilot or mining.  Maybe I'll start programming Perl between programming the jump computer.<br>

<p>I played EVE a little bit a year ago.  I'm playing occasionally now (character: "Teellox").  However I don't consider the low intensity a feature.  When I play a game I usually look for high-intensity and high excitement.  That probably means I should be spending more time in 0.0 space.
</p> <p>
My biggest problem with EVE is that I've found it lacks the <i>Crushbone Factor</i>.  Many zones, stations, areas, missions, and operations just "feel the same", regardless of where they are.  This is a hard thing to get right in a large game world, and is notoriously difficult for space-oriented games.
</p> <p>
To EVE's benefit, the economy appears to be well thought out, especially considering the original vintage of the game.  I'm a stickler for game economies, as poorly designed ones tend to suffer from boundless inflation which can have a serious impact on the rest of the game mechanics.
