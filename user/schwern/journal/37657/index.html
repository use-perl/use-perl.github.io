<h2>When XSLT Is Too Compact</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mdxi/">mdxi</a> on 2008-10-14T05:43:29</h3>
And no one is impressed with your httpd/roman numeral calculator, turn to Sun for even more ridiculously verbose and convoluted solutions to problems you never had in the first place.



<h2>Haven't We Learned Our Lesson?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2008-10-14T08:49:38</h3>
<p>XML is a fantastic tool, but trying to beat all problems into submission with it is simply ridiculous.  What on earth is Sun trying to solve with XPRESS (with they describe as a "scripting language") that requires the verbosity of XML?</p>



<h2>Torturing users to benefit the implementers.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/schwern/">schwern</a> on 2008-10-14T18:03:14</h3>
<p>The (false) laziest language designers and implementers in the world?  "Grammar?  Parser?  Eh, just use XML."  To <a href="http://jwz.livejournal.com/123070.html#t521918" title="livejournal.com">paraphrase Matt Robinson</a livejournal.com>, whenever a programmer thinks 'I'll just use XML' their computer's speakers should create some sort of cock-shaped soundwave and plunge it repeatedly through their skulls.</p><p>Patrick quoted Larry Wall in his Perl 6 talk to the effect that language designers torment language implementers to the benefit of the users.  This would appear to be the opposite.</p>



<h2>Tell Me About It...?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2008-10-15T20:54:30</h3>
<p>This week I'm on a SAP training course learning their XI/PI middleware application. It's built on a mixture of their legacy ABAP (COBOL like) technology and all new Java code. Internally the whole middleware engine uses a proprietary form of SOAP to send messages along their system. It's little more than XSLT with bells on but it's horribly slow and bloated.</p><p>In the class, a colleague mistyped a parameter instead of raising a sensible error message, Java dumped and he got a Java stack dump thing. I don't like the idea that a standard SAP provided JAR just falls to pieces if you send something in it didn't expect.</p><p>One thing I found interesting on the course so far has been that the other technical people all have a low opinion of Java - it's not just me. The instructor likes Java but he isn't a programmer... The more functional types seem to be more positive about Java, strange as they don't use it or see it.</p><p>Even ignoring SAP's Java bloat, they do their own XML which isn't real XML - though I've not been able to pin them down on exactly what part of the XML standard they don't support.</p>



<h2>Let's try it with bacon...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Eric Wilhelm/">Eric Wilhelm</a> on 2008-10-17T17:06:42</h3>
<p><code><br>block{<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; s{Hello there!}<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; add{ i{100} i{2} }<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i{42}<br>}</code></p><p><code>cond{<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ref{accounts\[Exchange\].lastname}<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>}<br></code></p><p>Yeah, still ridiculous, but compactly so!  Too bad about the square brackets... though I guess you could use the {{{ }}} quoting braces.</p>
