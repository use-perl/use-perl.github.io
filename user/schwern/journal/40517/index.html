<p>I've had <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/test_builder_2">a grant open for Test::Builder2</a> for, oh god over two years now.  Since I started it, Perl 6 has had a release!  I think its the second oldest running dev grant.<br/><br/>I've cleared the decks of other responsibilities and can dedicate September to, if not finishing, then at least releasing something people can poke at.  First alpha release was supposed to be "two weeks after the start" ha ha ha! oh god.  The design has evolved and simplified greatly in the intervening two years, but its time to get something the hell out the door.  At least a <a href="http://github.com/schwern/test-more/tree/Test-Builder2">Test::Builder2</a> Star if you will.<br/><br/>There's critical components missing.  There's no diagnostics, YAML or otherwise.  The issues with nested asserts are still congealing.  Plans are not enforced.  Result objects are in the middle of being remodeled... again.  But Test::Builder is using what parts of Test::Builder2 are usable.  Multiple output formats and streams work.  Asserts can be nested in the common, simple cases without having to fiddle with $Level.  And you can hook into various events.<br/><br/>Step one is I'm going to seal up what's there, write docs where they're missing, and release something.<br/><br/>A release before October or the grant dies.</p>
