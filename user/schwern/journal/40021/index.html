Here's the list of planned <a href="http://github.com/schwern/gitpan/issues/labels/feature">features</a>.  The second pass will be a rolling reimport of each distribution to bring everything up to the same standard, there was a lot of incremental improvements during the first pass.  I expect this to be changes to commit logs and tags with very little content change.<br/><br/>The issue of PAUSE ownership I'm going to punt on.  Its ugly and can be done entirely in parallel.  If someone else makes available a historical distribution ownership database, gitPAN will use it.

<p>So now we just need to submit those 20,000 projects to Ohloh and other source metrics'y places?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>



<h2>Thank you</h2>

Thank you for doing this.  This was a huge project and I think it's awesome.

<p>I've been meaning to put Perl-RPM onto git for a while, now, and been mostly held back by the fact that I never converted it from CVS to Subversion. Now that you have as much history as I could realistic need, is there an easy way to just outright seed a new repo from the gitPAN repo? Not just filling in holes like you did with David, but essentially cloning it (without it being treated as a repo clone)...</p>

<p>Yes, you can clone it.  There's nothing special about a clone.  Just change where the "origin" remote points to (presumably to your own repository) and push.</p><p>$ git clone git://github.com/gitpan/Perl-RPM<br>$ cd Perl-RPM/<br>$ git remote rm origin<br>$ git remote add origin git@github.com:rjray/Perl-RPM.git<br>$ git push origin master</p><p>That should do it.  This presumes you've created the Perl-RPM project on github.</p>
