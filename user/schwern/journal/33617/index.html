<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=schwern">I have an Internet-wide unique last name.</a>  There's few computer-literate Schwerns in the world (and if I have my selfish way it will remain that way!)  You might find a mention of <a href="http://www.start2finish.com/2001/r082501.htm">my father</a> finishing a race.  Or my relative <a href="http://www.schwern-yachten.de/eng/ueberuns.php">JÃÂ¼rgen</a> who <a href="http://www.schwern-yachten.de/">builds yachts.</a>  But its basically just me.<br/><br/>And that's handy, "Schwern" is available on pretty much every system.  But having your handle be your real name means there's no wall between the Internet and your real life, especially as I finally start to get into non-programming social networks.  Sometimes I want to have a secret identity on the Internet.  In that case I cleverly disguise myself as "Xwrn" (bonus points to anyone who knows why that name).<br/><br/>So here I am on two social networks.

<h2>Not that lucky</h2>

<p>
Well, I don't have such a privilege. Looking for "ferreira" at Google is no help: there should be thousands of pages before some reference to myself. I must force "ferreira perl" to get something relevant. But then I find the link to the <code>Shell::Perl</code> distribution first than my use.perl journal. Will that means that many people look for it and go away in disapointment?</p>

An American emailed me once. His name was Ron Savage too. He'd used some sort of egosearch package. What was spooky is that his wife's name was Pen, the same as mine, and both women were nurses...

<p>I have a new nephew.  His name is "Riley Lewis".  A couple of days later, my housemate informed me that he has a new nephew.  His name is "Riley Lewis".</p>

I've enjoyed a pointless hobby of <a href="http://www.coder.com/daniel/" title="coder.com">introducing other Daniels to each other</a coder.com>.  So it amused me greatly to learn that the "Yes, my name is Daniel Allen too" group on Facebook has 48 members.
</p><p>
And I have a few secret identities, but my real one is still pretty easy to find in google.  Good thing I'm not paranoid. Much.</p>

<h2>Bonus points?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dakkar/">dakkar</a> on 2007-06-28T08:44:25</h3>
<p>It's "Xwrn" because the symbol "X" (in mathematics) come from the spanish writing of the pronunciation of the arabic word "&#1588;&#1610;&#1569;", "thing", used in algebric text... and the first sound of that word is roughly "sch"...</p>

<p>And yes, I knew it <i>before</i> checking the spelling on Wikipedia... I'm way too geek for my own good.</p>

I thought the X is the same as the one in Xmas, thus, coming from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_(letter)" title="wikipedia.org">Greek letter Chi</a wikipedia.org>.

While those are very good answers, and you're on the right track, they're incorrect.  I'll give you a hint, the answer is googlable.
