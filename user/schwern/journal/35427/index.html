<div class="span8">
<p>I'm trying to track down a nasty problem involving the Class::DBI compatibility wrapper around DBIx::Class and Class::Trigger.  I've got closures being created, and then stored somewhere, and then way later in the code those closures run.  Oh, and all this is a bug that only happens near the end of a very specific, big wad of code.<br/><br/>Many, many layers, action at a long distance, lots of code to wade through until we hit the problem and those damned opaque closures.<br/><br/>I can't examine what's in the trigger queue because it's all closures, all the debugger or Data::Dumper will show me is "CODE(0x189fc3c)" and maybe line which generated it if I'm lucky.  Getting in there with the debugger is a royal pain because every time I have to restart the process, set up the breakpoints... very time consuming and I have to do it over and over again as I slowly zero in on the problem.<br/><br/>There's a little known way to hard code breakpoints into the code.  It's done by setting $DB::single.  Usually you see it as "$DB::single = 1" but it's even less widely realized that it doesn't have to be 1.  You can set it to any true value or expression!  "$DB::single = $foo == 42" is "break when $foo is 42".  Handy.  After a lot of work I finally figured out the particular closure that was misfiring, it was being passed in the wrong arguments.  I had to catch the point where that particular closure was being called to see how the arguments were being made.  There's hundreds of them, so I can't just go through by hand.  How do you identify a particular closure?<br/><br/>Enter <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Data-Dump-Streamer">Data::Dump::Streamer</a>.  By Yves Orton, this is Data::Dumper on steroids.  Not satisfied with the limitations of Data::Dumper, Yves improved on it with a module that can serialize most everything you can throw at it.  The edge cases most of us consider impossible, like closures. :)<br/><br/><pre>
use DDS;  # an alias for Data::Dump::Streamer<br/><br/>my $thing = 42;
my $code = sub { print $thing };<br/><br/>print Dump $code;
</pre><br/><br/><pre>
my ($thing);
$thing = 42;
$CODE1 = sub {
           print $thing;
         };
</pre><br/><br/>Well now, let's combine the two.  $DB::single and DDS.<br/><br/><pre>
use DDS;
$DB::single = grep /\Q$thing = 42\E/, Dump $code;
</pre><br/><br/>Now the code stops right before it runs just the trigger I want.</p>
