<p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-Metaphone/">Text::Metaphone</a> was my first real module.  I wrote it in 1997, a translation of some really awful and buggy C code from a book into slightly less buggy and awful C code.  It got me my first real job, they were impressed at the little bit of C and XS I could do.  Because I don't really know XS its had nasty memory leak.<br/><br/>Tonight, after the hackathon, I decided to look into updating <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/mschwern/?R=A">my oldest modules</a>.  Text::Metaphone was at the top of the list with that damned memory leak.  I threw out a pile of h2xs generated junk, detabified and converted the tests to Test::More.  Then with all that old garbage out of the way I quickly realized that a string allocated in the C code wasn't getting free'd and plugged the leak.  I also eliminated an unnecessary Perl function wrapper around the XS speeding things up by about 2 times.<br/><br/>So here we are, 8 years after the last release, with Text::Metaphone 2.0.<br/><br/>Next: D'oh::Year!</p>

You plugged a memory leak and that makes it a version 2.0? Gee, I don't really care how many years it has taken, but that seems to me like a too big a version jump, regardless.

Isn't that really up to him? He could have changed the version to 5 if he wanted to.

Or 6. That seems to be very popular with Microsoft. Sun, with Java, also pulls weird stunts in regard to version numbers. They've lost me on the way.<br><br>Most Perl modules never even make it to version 1.00, not even after years and lots of heavy use. Win32::API for example.

Anyway, when a module version jumps from version 1.x to version 2.0, I've come to expect something more than a bug fix.

<p>So the doubled performance and code cleanups don&#8217;t do it for you?</p>

<p>And in any case, why would you care? Are you a heavy user of Text::Metaphone or something?</p>

You can read <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/schwern/journal/33651" title="perl.org">my philosophy of version numbers elsewhere.</a perl.org><br><br>Now, as to why I decided this release is version 2.00 can be found in the Changes log.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Heh, what happened to 1.00?  Never existed, it was supposed to be the gamma<br>release of the pure perl version of the module.  Skipped straight to 1.90,<br>alpha XS version.<br></cite></div></blockquote> <br><br>1.00 would have been what I considered the "stable" Perl version but I decided to rewrite everything so I jumped over 1.00 directly to 1.9x to symbolize the big change leading up to a "stable" XS version: 2.00.  So here it is.<br><br>Seeing as how I went from 1.96 to 2.00 this isn't a big leap.<br><br>These decisions predate the X.Y_Z alpha versioning scheme in use on CPAN, but I'd probably do it the same way now seeing as how Text::Metaphone isn't exactly a critical module that requires a lengthy official alpha process to avoid breaking CPAN.
