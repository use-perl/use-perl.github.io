<p><P>I want to work at the Hardware Obfuscation Department at Apple that makes laptops OBSCENELY difficult to take apart.  I want to select twenty different types of screws to use in a single machine.  I want to develop new and interesting layers of plastic clips that are impossible to get apart without stressing something.  I want to bury the hard drive so deep in the casing that it takes three days to replace it.  I want to do all this and more.<br/><br/><P>I want the folks at Apple Warranty Repair to believe this is a purely hypothetical rant.</p>

<h2>Special screwdrivers</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2003-05-28T12:38:32</h3>
It would also seem that The Rest Of Us happen to have special screwdrivers when we want to do something as mundane as installing an Airport card.  It's my only gripe with my iBook.

<h2>That's not a new feature</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2003-05-28T13:31:43</h3>
The original Macintosh case (128, 512, plus, SE) required a Torx screwdriver with a 12 inch (30 cm) shaft to undo or tighten the screw that held the shell of the case to the base.  You had to buy the screwdriver specially because nobody had evre previously owned one.  Initially, only Apple service people could get them, although tool makers eventually covered this market.

<p>Frighteningly enough, I owned one of those.  It belittled my manhood.

</p><p>Then there was the special "case cracker" tool to lift and pry apart the two halves of the case.  I didn't have one so I used half a cassette tape case instead.</p>

And then the 'be incredibly careful around the CRT' thing...

<h2>unique designs</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2003-05-29T08:57:59</h3>
<p>often require unique parts and tools. See <a href="http://www.radtech.us/tools.html" title="radtech.us">RadTech</a radtech.us> for the right tools and <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/user/gamba2/manuals.html" title="earthlink.net">get the service manual</a earthlink.net>. Small hands and patience are useful.</p>
