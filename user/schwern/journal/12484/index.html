<p>Over in Great Britain, Tony Blair is taking a lot of heat because those weapons were the primary reason for our unpopular invasion.  Over here in "love it or leave it" America, you don't hear a lot about it.  Colin Powell cites plagiarized intelligence reports (which Britain later admitted) and forged documents (that no one claims to know the origin of) and yet no seems to care.</p>

<p>So we're going after Saddam for the weapons but we couldn't find them.  Eh, maybe we were going after him for his role in 9/11.  Well, even the US intelligence community admits that there's no evidence of his role.  So we go after him for his links to Al Qaeda<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... that we can't establish.  So, we're going to go after him because he's a really, really bad man.  (but we're convenie</p>

<p>Somehow, those who support the war seem to have no problem that every justification for it has fallen flat and they're quite happy to pounce on another one.  Witness the people who said "yeah, but the Iraqis are happy we liberated them!".  (Never mind all of the protests about our occupation).</p>

<p>I guess the ends justify the means.</p>

<p>Careful; I seem to remember believing that the threat of force is a credible deterrant and I'm rather displeased by the feeble apologetics of a shifting justification.  If there's no serious evidence of a credible threat, the action was unjustified.  I think a lot of people are better off, but a lot of people are dead and still more are suffering through a lot of chaos.  Someone ought to answer for that.</p>

<p>Then again, I have serious doubts that an intelligence agency that couldn't even find its pants to have them down around its ankles a couple of years ago has suddenly transformed into a lean, mean, spying machine.</p>

The justification to invade Iraq was that Iraq didn't live up to their commitment to 'fully, proactively and immediately' disarm as required by Resolution 1441.  Everyone who signed on to Resolution 1441, the entire UN Security council, was clear on the fact that Iraq did possess such weapons.<br> <p>It was clear that they were playing games with the UN Inspectors.  It's also clear from what we are finding that they had an active program to develop or research WMDs.<br> </p><p>The fact that they may have been busy destroying (or hiding in Syria) their weapons of mass destruction in a process outside of that dictated by Resolution 1441 should give one pause.  Certainly, if Iraq had no WMD, they could have fully cooperated with the UN Inspectors and made a mockery of the US and probably gotten the sanctions lifted in no time.<br> </p><p>I'm satisfied that Iraq had them, had intention to build them again and may have destroyed them in a cat-and-mouse game with the Inspectors that was aimed at not eliminating their ability to rebuild them in the future.<br> </p><ul><li><i>Well, even the US intelligence community admits that there's no evidence of his role.

I hear more and more about links to Al Qaeda all the time.  It's pretty clear that Iraq was harboring and support Ansar Al-Islam, a group associated with Al Qaeda.<br> </p><p>Perhaps you would be interested in what Clinton CIA Directory Woolsey <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/showinsidecover.shtml?a=2003/3/7/140812" title="newsmax.com">has to say about the matter</a newsmax.com>.<br> </p><ul><li><i>Witness the people who said "yeah, but the Iraqis are happy we liberated them!".

Also consider there are at least a few other countries that have WMD and are not considered a threat to world peace by the US and its allies? <br> <br>You're not going to break into the house of someone living across town because you suspect he has a weapon (while all he has is some fire crackers) and you're afraid he is going to break into your extremly well protected mansion, while other people in your neighbourhood do have weapons and brag about it? <br> <br>Yes, Saddam probably has broken Geneva Convention regulations, International Embargos and God knows what else. And yes, I do think it was necesarry that SOME action was taken. But dozens of other countries broke those regulations, and others too. For some reason, loads of people still smoke Cuban cigars and have been for many years while the trading embargo with Cuba was still in place. Many countries (even western ones) harbor Islam Extremists. Maybe it's a good thing to clean out their own back yard before occupying someone else's.<br> <br>If I recall correctly, the US supported Iraq in the whole Iraq/Iran issue in the 1980's. I also recall the US supporting Afghanistan (and the Taliban) back when the russians tried to occupy Afghanistan (most part of the 1980's). <br> <br>This is all way too political for a perl site and this will probably result in an anonymous van being parked outside my house. I'll ask em in for some coffee if that happens...

<p>You know, when I read a news story about Iraq on <a href="http://www.arabnews.com/" title="arabnews.com">Arab News</a arabnews.com>, I am painfully aware that they have their own agenda and will see things from a different viewpoint.  I think this is an important thing to remember, particularly when I notice (and I have on more than one occassion) that their coverage of an event is often radically different from US coverage.</p>

<p>If one accepts that to be a reasonable point of view, then it's also fair to point out that a news site such as <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/" title="newsmax.com">News Max</a newsmax.com> (linked to by you) which does not even remotely pretend to be impartial, just might be inclined to report things a bit differently than others do.</p>

<p>I can quote <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/04/september11/main520830.shtml" title="cbsnews.com">allegedly impartial news sources</a cbsnews.com> who would be happy to suggest that perhaps things are not what we thought:</p>

<blockquote><div>(CBS) CBS News has learned that barely five hours after American Airlines Flight 77 plowed into the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was telling his aides to come up with plans for striking Iraq &#8212; even though there was no evidence linking Saddam Hussein to the attacks. </div></blockquote>

<p>I can find  plenty of other citations, just as I am sure that you can.  If they're to be found, though, it would be nice that they not come from such a blatantly biased source.  For example, the <em>former</em> CIA director's "bombshell testimony" (their words, not mine):</p>

<blockquote><div>"I believe it is definitely more likely than not that some degree of common knowledge between [al-Qaeda and Iraq] was involved here."</div></blockquote>

<p>Ignoring how terribly wishy-washy that statement is, I turn to the headline, which reads "CIA's Woolsey Tells Court: Iraq Involved in 9/11".  The story doesn't say that.  The story doesn't even remotely say that.  According to the story, Woolsey lays out many suggestive references, but the title is completely misleading (something that is not uncommon on News Max).  Of course, I could just rebut this by pointing out <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/stclair1015.html" title="counterpunch.org">another blatatantly biased</a counterpunch.org> site and just argue "but they're right"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>CBS News impartial!  Give me a break.  Read <i>former</i> CBS news reporter Bernard Goldberg's book <i>Bias</i> about the extreme liberal bias at CBS.<br> </p><p>Hey, maybe you should become a journalist, the way you spin the facts and selectively quote.  First, you impune Woolsey as being a <i>former</i> CIA Director (under Clinton, BTW, so that should help to eliminate Republican slant).  Then you take that one quote out of the article and spin it to make it seem like Woolsey only supports my point tangentially or weakly.<br> </p><p>You said that we could not establish a link between Iraq and Al Qaeda.  I pointed out that we already have and you ignored Woolsey when he clearly stated:<br> </p><blockquote><div> <br>At the very least, Saddam Hussein is guilty of aiding and abetting the activities of al-Qaeda, Woolsey contended.<br> <br>He also offered evidence suggesting that Baghdad had prior knowledge of the 9/11 attacks.<br> <br>A July 21, 2001, article in an Egyptian newspaper, headlined "America, an Obsession with Osama bin Laden," indicated that Baghdad knew what was coming less than months later, the former U.S. intelligence chief told the court. The report, written by an Iraqi, predicted bin Laden would target both New York City and the Pentagon.<br> <br>Woolsey noted a line in the story warning that bin Laden would "strike America on the arm that is already hurting," explaining that the phrase was likely a reference to the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.<br> <br>No Iraqi journalist would write such a report without his government's knowledge and approval, Woolsey testified.<br> </div></blockquote> <br> <p>There's no doubt that Iraq had a nuclear program.  There's also no doubt that Saddam still had regional aims, having never given up his claim to Kuwait (as he was required to do as part of the Gulf War I armistice, BTW).  The only way he could have possibly supported his regional aims was to remove the US and Britain from the picture.<br> </p><p>Saddam had every reason to develop nuclear weapons and give them to Al Qaeda in order to strike crippling blows on America.  I think what we did in Iraq goes a long way toward preventing that threat.<br> </p><p>Your cynicism about how we used the "really bad man" argument against Saddam is disgusting.  By the UN's own figures, around 10,000 people every MONTH died from systematic starvation and medical deprivation of the Iraqi people, while Saddam used the Food for Oil money to build more elaborate palaces and mobile weapon labs.<br> </p><p>I think we've put an end to that horror, as well.

<p>jordan, I try write carefully, so please read it carefully and do not accuse me of saying things that I did not say.  I'm a pretty easy going person and I don't mind at all if you disagree with me.  I do mind if you misrepresent what I say.  I did <em>not</em> write that CBS is impartial.  I wrote that CBS is 'allegedly' impartial.  Further, I pointed out that Woolsey was no longer the director of the CIA because you did not and I felt that it was relevant to whether or not he is privy to current information.  However, whether or not he served under Clinton is irrelevant to whether or not he is correct.</p>

<p>The point that I was making was twofold.  First, your source was a site that has a very strong conservative bias and it's fair to keep that in mind while reading what they have to say.  Second, the headline was flat out wrong.  It read "CIA's Woolsey Tells Court: Iraq Involved in 9/11".  The problem is, the article didn't say that.  Woolsey didn't say that.  The article repeatedly quotes Woolsey as "suggesting" (their words, not mine) that Iraq <em>may</em> had foreknowledge of 9/11.  Reading through it carefully makes it clear that this man was speculating about an involvement.  That is <em>not</em> what the headline read.  I was pointing out the fact that the article didn't match the headline.  That bears repeating:  the article did NOT MATCH THE HEADLINE.  If this is "journalism"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... well, that leads to the next paragraph.</p>

<p>And as for the "liberal bias" of CBS news, if you truly believe that the multinational conglomerate that owns CBS news is somehow some hotbed of liberalism, I must say that I don't understand your rationale.  <a href="http://www.fair.org/articles/bias-op-ed.html" title="fair.org">Goldberg's ridiculous book</a fair.org> is a typical example of the sloppy "journalism" that is accepted without much comment.  I remember picking it up and reading through it at a bookstore and I was absolutely aghast at it, but so many people want to buy into whatever supports their personal belief system.  Mind you, most so-called liberals in the US are just as ridiculous in their thoughts and arguments, so please do not take this as an attack solely on conservative politics in the US!</p>

<p>You miss the point.  You put forth Iraq playing games with UN inspectors as an admission of guilt.  Consider the hypothectical situation of UN weapon inspectors in the US.  You know the US would scream bloody murder if they came into our country, regardless of the reason.  Hell, we're the country with the law stating we'll extract US citizens from war crimes trials!  You know we'd harass them every step of the way.  This would not be an admission of guilt but an expression of overinflated national pride.  I'm sure you can see how this relates to Iraq playing games with the UN inspectors.

<p>We went into Iraq to help the Iraqi people about the same as we went into Kwauit to fight for democracy.  How do I know we didn't do this for humanitarian reasons?  Because we're not in Ugunda or Sudan.  Because we walked out of Somalia after getting a bloody nose.  Because we do nothing about East Timor or Tibet.  Because the US contributes only 2% of the UN peacekeeping force.  Because we actively undermine the International Criminal Court.

<ul><li><i>You miss the point. You put forth Iraq playing games with UN inspectors as an admission of guilt.</i></li> </ul>  <br> <p>When Resolution 1441 required 'full, immediate and proactive disarmament' and a full accounting for  weapons that previous UN inspectors had identified and they play games, that is not an admission of guilt, that is, in itself, a violation.<br> </p><p>I think you miss the point our insisting on the language of Resolution 1441 requiring "full, immediate and proactive disarmament".  You see, inspections have never worked.  They didn't work after WWI in Germany, they didn't work in Korea, they didn't work in Iraq in the 1990s (the inspectors found little or nothing until defectors told them where things were, including one facility that was 'inspected' no less than 3 times before Kamel Hussein defected to Jordan and identified it as a Bio-weapon facility) and more recently they didn't work in Iran.  We knew that inspections don't work, especially in the long run.  The International Community always loses its will, as they did in Germany in the 20s and 30s or the country inspected plays games with the inspectors and eventually arranges for the inspectors to leave.  That's why Resolution 1441 required FULL and IMMEDIATE disarmament.<br> </p><p>Even Hans Blix admitted that Iraq had fallen short of this standard.  That should have been that, and required 'Serious Consequences'.  But no, there were those on the Security Council who seemed to have another aggenda.<br> </p><ul><li><i>See, here's the problem with that: That Armistice was signed with the UN, not the US and Britian. We can't charge in under the pretext of enforcing an argreement signed with a different political body.</i></li></ul>  <br> <p>The US and the UK have had to take the lead role in enforcing those terms.  The US is blamed by the Arab World for being at war with Iraq for a decade.  On Al Jazheera they called the last 10 years the "US War on Iraq".<br> </p><p>When the UN Security Council has been so compromised as to include those who have an interest in maintaining Saddam Hussein in power, we have to take action.  Ultimately, it's about insisting on International agreements.  The UN clearly did not, we did.  We had the power and I feel we had the right.<br> </p><ul><li><i>We went into Iraq to help the Iraqi people about the same as we went into Kwauit to fight for democracy.<br></i></li> </ul>  <br> <p>I would concede that we didn't go into Iraq only to correct human rights abuses.  So what?<br> </p><p>The US Civil War wasn't <i>only</i> about freeing the slaves, but that was the result and I think that's a good thing and enough justification if you're looking for it.<br> </p><p>Of course we didn't go into Kuwait to establish Democracy.  We went in to evict the Iraqis.  But, now we see Democratic reforms in Kuwait making it one of the most Democratic countries in the region.  A good thing I think and only made possible by our continued insistence.<br> </p><ul><li><i> <br>
&nbsp; How do I know we didn't do this for humanitarian reasons? Because we're not in Ugunda or Sudan.<br></i></li> </ul>  <br> <p>We can't be everywhere and we don't have other powerful motivations like keeping WMD out of the hands of Islamic Terrorists in these cases.  The fact that we aren't in Uganda or the Sudan proves nothing.<br> </p><p>But this is just a red herring.  You don't want us to occupy Africa and most of the Middle East.  You just want the fact that we don't eradicated all Human Rights abuses as an argument against our eradicating Saddam Hussein's abuses first.  The fact that we don't run around fixing the whole world first is just an argumentive point to you.  I doubt you care at all about the people of Uganda or Sudan, either.<br> </p><p>Should we now let the Bathists take back rule in Iraq, extracting brutal revenge over the Iraqi collaborators because we didn't do things in the "right order" (first Uganda, then...).  No, we take the good with the good.  When we can fix things, we do.<br> </p><ul><li><i> <br>Because we walked out of Somalia after getting a bloody nose.</i></li></ul>  <br> <p>Huh?  If we didn't care about the misery of the Somali people, why were we there in the first place?  I readily agree that we should have had reasonable rules of engagement to effectively carry out our mission and that we should have stuck to it, but clearly our motivation was noble.  George HW Bush got us in there for good reasons, but Clinton lacked the stomach to finish the job.<br> </p><ul><li><i>Because we do nothing about East Timor or Tibet.<br></i></li> </ul>  <br> <p>We support the UN actions in East Timor.  Aren't there SOME places in the world that are best handled by regional interests?  Must we be responsible for every abuse?<br> </p><p>In the case of Iraq, I couldn't see regional interests as capable of addressing this, so we went in.  Note that Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, UAE and Oman were all supportive of our Iraqi action.<br> </p><p>What should we do, specifically, about Tibet?  Go to war with China over this?  Our economic engagement in China seems to be bringing about Democratic reforms.  Should we instead attempt to isolate China?  Another red herring.  You don't really have a plan to address Tibet, you just use it as an argument that the US Government doesn't care about Human Rights.<br> </p><ul><li><i> <br>Because the US contributes only 2% of the UN peacekeeping force.<br></i></li> </ul>  <br> <p>Please source this.  Does this include our 70,000+ troops that support the Korean Armistice?  Korea was a UN action, you know.<br> </p><p>Does this include the many troops we have in the Balkans, some of which are under NATO, not UN authority?<br> </p><p>Oh, Kosovo is another fine example of our noble motives and the ineffectiveness of the UN.  Why did the US go into Kosovo if it wasn't to save the Islamic Kosovars from slaughter?  The UN was worthless here because Russia kept balking and threatening Veto to any UN Resolution against the Serbian genocide.<br> </p><p>I wonder if this 2% includes the fact that the bulk of the Air Power ever brought to bear in UN actions is US.<br> </p><ul><li><i> <br>Because we actively undermine the International Criminal Court.<br></i></li> </ul>  <br> <p>We don't give up our Sovereignty to a Court that, from the example of the Belgian Courts, would be used for political purposes.<br> </p><ul><li><i> <br>Because there's millions of people around the world that need help that we ignore because they don't happen to be sitting on a big chunk of the world's oil supply.<br> </i><p><i> <br>The answer is, of course, oil.<br></i></p></li> </ul>  <br> <p>This is absurd on it's face.  If we wanted cheap oil, we'd just have lifted the sanctions on Iraq and let Saddam flood the market with all the oil we could use.<br> </p><p>Of course, the problem is that any reasonable person could see that Saddam would have used the money to threaten his regional neighbors.<br> </p><p>Look, I agree that the fact that Iraq has lots of oil has a lot to do with the dynamic there.  The fact is that we can't let a mad and brutal dictator, evidenced by how he treats his own people, to have control over that wealth.  So, oil is part of the equation.  We want that wealth to be put to good use, like freeing and rebuilding Iraq.  I'll be willing to bet that the average Iraqi will benefit a great deal from the Oil money that will start flowing soon, much more so than under Saddam.<br> </p><ul><li><i>We invaded Iraq alone to carve it up for ourselves and we don't even have to share any of it with the UN.<br></i></li> </ul>  <br> <p>Oh yes, we should share it with the UN, just <a href="http://www.puk.org/web/htm/news/nws/oil4food_un.html" title="puk.org">like they carved up the lucrative Oil For Food program for to the benefit of their bureacratic cronies and Saddam</a puk.org>.<br> </p><ul><li><i>If you feel we should go to war for such trivial reasons, then you do not truly understand what war is.<br></i></li> </ul>  <br> <p>I understand that war is a 'Serious Consequence'.

This lesson wouldn't have been lost on Kim Jong-il and others.</p>

<em>You put forth Iraq playing games with UN inspectors as an admission of guilt.</em> <br> <br>I don't.  I think it is very fishy, but not necessarily a sign of guilt.<br> <br> <em>Consider the hypothectical situation of UN weapon inspectors in the US. You know the US would scream bloody murder if they came into our country, regardless of the reason.</em> <br> <br>So?  Then we would be wrong too.  Look, Iraq was stated as guilty by the UN Security Council, and that guilty verdict was reaffirmed more than a dozen times in a dozen years; Iraq itself agreed to destroy its weapons and submit to inspections; Iraq itself agreed to allow the UN to take further steps if inspections did not accomplish the task of disarmament and verification.  If the US had been found so guilty, and had agreed to what Iraq agreed to, and still blocked it, well<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... tough for the US!<br> <br> <em>The answer is, of course, oil. We invaded Iraq alone to carve it up for ourselves and we don't even have to share any of it with the UN.</em> <br> <br>That's as much nonsense as someone saying it was about liberating Iraqis.  Yes, oil has a bit part to do with it, but to take that and leap to "we want to take Iraq's oil" is baseless.<br> <br>It was about oil, but not for the sake of taking oil, but for the sake of removing a man who was a serious risk to the stability of the flow of oil from the region.  If we just wanted oil, we could have fought for the lifting of the sanctions in exchange for cheap oil.  That would have given us as much oil as we wanted for far less money than the war and rebuilding is costing.<br> <br>It was about liberation, but not because we love Iraqis, but because a free Iraqi people will lead to a more stable region, which is what the UN said in Resolution 687 when it wrote about the importance of peace and security in the Middle East.<br>

And again, yes, their playing games, while a serious breach of UN resolutions obligating a response, did not necessarily mean they actually possessed weapons, it only meant that the responsible and logical thing to do is to assume that they have the weapons, for practical purposes, in the absence of the required cooperation.<br>

<em>See, here's the problem with that: That Armistice was signed with the UN, not the US and Britian. We can't charge in under the pretext of enforcing an argreement signed with a different political body.</em> <br> <br>That is an eminently fair point to make, but it misses something, IMO.  Resolution 687 was not merely a warning to Iraq to comply or else; it was a promise to the United States that the UN Security Concil would handle the situation.  It was a cease-fire between Iraq, Kuwait, and the other nations involved.<br> <br>There are several ways war can end.  In this case, the goal of the war, on the UN's part, must be fulfilled for the war to end.  That goal was elimination of the Iraqi threat.  The two obvious ways to achieve that is by force or voluntarily.  Res. 687 was an attempt to do it voluntarily.  That attempt was given 12 years, and it failed.  Once it fails, the UN has a built-in obligation -- the very last clause of 687 -- to take "further steps."  It refused to do so.<br> <br>So where does that leave the US?  It agreed to a cease-fire, that it would not advance on Baghdad and take out Hussein, on the basis that the UN would eliminate the threat.  The UN did not.  It broke its promise in 687.  So the cease-fire becomes, legally, null and void.  And the US goes back to what its plan was initially: to eliminate the threat by force.<br> <br>Ideally, yes, the UN Security Council would live up to its obligations to take care of the problem.  But that the Security Council took on the problem does not mean that the memeber nations cannot act on their own, should the Security Council not fulfill its obligations.<br> <br>Now, there is the part of the UN Charter that says all member nations must resolve disputes not by force on their own, but through the UN.  But that part of the Charter has no legal force, as it has been rendered obsolete by precedent.  It has never been enforced.  And even if it were to be asserted by the UN -- note that Kofi Annan dared not quote that part of the charter in his criticisms of the US -- then the US could simply say, "we are still at war with Iraq, at the approval of the UN Security Council, because war does not end until the terms of the cease-fire are completed, which by everyone's admission they never were," and be entirely legally justified.<br> <br>The only question at that point would be if the Security Council were given ample opportunity to live up to their end of the bargain of Res. 687, and it would be hard to argue that they were not.<br> <br>All this just to say that while it is important to talk about whose role it is to use military force, the answer is not as clear-cut as you make it, and I think the reason why Annan never said that the U.S. actions are illegal is because he knows full well than the U.N. breached its own resolutions by not enforcing them.<br>

<em>Does it really matter how they destroyed them as long as they got destroyed?</em> <br> <br>Yes, it does.  There is a reason that Resolution 687 says that the destruction of biological and chemical weapons must be conducted under UN supervision: verification.  We cannot trust their word.<br> <br> <em>Same result either way, weapons destroyed.</em> <br> <br>Assuming they actually are destroyed<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... something we logically cannot do, without verification.<br> <br>Hans Blix was clear on the point that it is, absolutely, Iraq's obligation to account for all their weapons, destroyed or not, and that they had failed in this regard.  And really, whatever else Iraq did do right in the inspections, the two most important things mentioned in Resolution 1441 -- providing evidence of existing weapons, or evidence of destroyed weapons, and providing interviews with scientists under the terms prescribed by the UN inspectors -- were complete failures by Iraq.
