<p>I want <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/carlmanaster/9254599/in/set-228603/">this</a>.  A thing that let's you visualize how the routines in your program are interconnected and how complex your routines are.<br/><br/>In particular...<br/><br/>* Lines pointing from the current routine to other routines it uses.
* Lines pointing into the current routine from other routines which use it.
* Lines connecting any global (which includes lexicals scoped outside a routine) your touine uses to all other uses of the global to show just how they interconnect (and toss encapsulation out the window).
* A visualization, either with color or length, of the length of each routine.
* A visualization of how deeply nested a routine gets.<br/><br/>Those last two, in particular, are really good, cheap indications of complexity.

<h2>Interesting...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jplindstrom/">jplindstrom</a> on 2008-01-04T18:05:37</h3>
I tried something similar in PerlySense, but I consider it a failed experiment.<br><br>In the Overview, there is (well, was) a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/johanl/Devel-PerlySense-0.0130/lib/Devel/PerlySense.pm#Class_Overview" title="cpan.org">Signature Survey</a cpan.org> of the file, i.e. a char for each type of "thing" in the file (pod blocks, subs, statements, string literals, etc). Like this:<p><blockquote> <div><tt>* Structure *<br>;;;';;;;;;;{;";}{;;;;{}"";{}"";";}{;;;';';";;;{;'";;';;;<br>};';}S{;";"";;}S{;<nobr>'<wbr></nobr>  {}{"};;;}S{;;;;";";;};</tt></div> </blockquote> I got the idea in an interesting article about <a href="http://media.pragprog.com/articles/mar_02_archeology.pdf" title="pragprog.com">Software Archeology</a pragprog.com>.<br><br>I had hoped it would give me a kind of ambient feel of the structure of the file, but I found it didn't actually do that for me. Maybe it could have worked better with color highlighting, maybe it didn't actually represent anything useful. So I removed it in later versions.<br><br>Looking at the image you linked to it's clear that may work better. It could also be an indicator next to each sub/method being displayed in the Overview (On a more visionary time scale (i.e. not right now) I'm also thinking of indicating complexity, edit volatility/vcs activity with sparklines, test coverage and stuff there).<br>



<h2>Something simpler</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2008-01-04T19:13:08</h3>
I have only seen something that breaks code into a flow chart. Nothing so fancy as what you want to see.



<h2>Swoosh, swoosh</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jplindstrom/">jplindstrom</a> on 2008-01-05T16:43:31</h3>
I saw <a href="http://www.whitney.org/arport/commissions/codedoc/Paley/CodeProfiles_800x600.htm" title="whitney.org">this </a whitney.org> on Reddit just now.<br><br>More cool than useful perhaps, but definitely very cool<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>Here's a kinda-sorta solution</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/drhyde/">drhyde</a> on 2008-01-07T12:01:22</h3>
<p>Many years ago I was having trouble remembering how my code interacted with itself, so wrote <a href="http://www.cantrell.org.uk/david/tech/perl-scripts/perl-dep/" title="cantrell.org.uk">this</a cantrell.org.uk>.  It produces a text report of what subroutines call what subroutines, and what subroutines are called by what subroutines.

</p><p>The code is hideous, and I wouldn't dream of writing it that way now, but on the other hand it does mostly work, and might make a good starting point.  If anyone wants to have a go at improving it, be my guest.</p>
