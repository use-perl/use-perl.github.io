<p>Yes, I've gone dark.  I blame $paid$ work and the six foot snowdrift of email viruses blocking up my inbox.  <br/><br/>SpamAssassin is collapsing under the load, it can take an hour to filter a day's mail, and I can't keep the rules up to date.  I'm trying GMail, figure Google has the CPU to burn on spam filtering, but that's not doing much better except to give me a fresh inbox to decimate.  That and web interfaces are too damned slow for the volumne of mail I get.  I have several weeks of spam and ham piled up so I'm in the middle of seeing if I can train SA's bayes filter to work reliably.  Maybe then I won't feel like a blue whale trying to read mail.  Hopefully that'll work out and I can start reading mail again this week.<br/><br/>I'm moving my code repositories off my laptop and onto a publicly visible server, so even if I don't get around to releasing new module versions at least you can get at what's in the repository.  There's all but a new release of Test::More awaiting.  I have Interesting Plans for how the repository will work (think: Aegis without the networking annoyances).<br/><br/>Finally, I'm going to reduce my $paid$ work load.  I don't know how humans do this five day, 9 to 6 work week thing with commute.  I find myself spending nights just cooking dinner and cleaning up and the whole weekend just recovering from the week.  No time for serious coding projects.

Have you tried using spamc with SpamAssassin?  It really helps reduce the resources used.

Yeah, I'm using spamc.  My<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.forward uses Mail::Audit and its not doing anything a simple procmail filter couldn't, so maybe I'll just choke back my bile and switch to procmail.<br>

Definitely use procmail!  I have a load of rules which match Windows executables and<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/dev/null them.  Rules to match my mailing lists and deliver messages straight to their folders - I assume that mailing lists are tolerably spam-free.  Only what's left after that gets thrown at spamassassin.  It cut the load tremendously.  If you want a copy of the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.procmailrc, yell.

<p>They keep you busy with work so you don't notice them stealing billions of dollars and starting wars.

What do you think my "work" is?
