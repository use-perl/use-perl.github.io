<p>After needing it done for about 10 years I got all my wisdom teeth pulled yesterday morning.  Despite having had a gorey mouth full of blood, gauze and novocaine it hasn't been painful at all.  I was knocked out for the procedure which only took an hour or so.  They have me on what I now realize is Vicodin (hydrocodone bitartrate & acetaminophen) which could explain why this has been so painless.  One of the odder things I was told to do is bite down on tea bags to stop the bleeding and wouldn't you know it, it worked.  Tasted pretty good, too.  Tetleys if you must know.<br/><br/>I was eating yogurt and ice cream almost right away.  I still haven't moved up to anything solid yet, even potato salad was too much, not because it'll hurt but because the idea of bits of potato getting stuck in the empty sockets... yurk!<br/><br/>Now all I want is pizza. :(</p>

I had my four points of wisdom pulled out at the same time, too.<br><br>However, I stupidly believed what they said about maybe having to replace the cotton in my mouth after a couple of hours.  It made sense, so I dutifully got some clean cotton, and over the kitchen sink plugged out the blood-soaked cotton bits. (I was still on some pretty good drugs so I was not afraid of pain.)<br><br>No pain allright, but the blood gushed forth from the empty sockets and my mouth became quite full of my own blood. For the first and so far last time in my life I almost fainted: my legs went all jelly-like and I started to sway, only by grabbing the edge of the sink real tight I stayed upright and conscious.  After a lot of spitting and rinsing and inserting new cotton I popped another pill and went to get some sleep.<br>

And there I was thinking you were referring to <a href="http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=qw114785100157B226" title="iol.co.za">this recent newsflash</a iol.co.za>. Looks like you weren't.
