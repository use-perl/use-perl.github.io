<p>Josh Heumann asked me for some help teaching testing to his co-workers.  So here's another essay-in-an-email I'm just going to paste-archive.<br/><br/>

team of programmers who don't know how to test is pretty much the worst way to
do it.  Trying to write the tests reveals all sorts of inadequacies and
brittleness in the design of the system that make testing (and everything else)
really hard and then people think testing itself is hard and not worth the
trouble.<br/><br/>Unfortunately its also the most common way to do it.<br/><br/>

guess... MySQL, then you can make "sandbox" databases where you load up the
schema into a fresh database and go.  You can even have test data living in a
static test dump.<br/><br/>The alternative is to have one test database instance populated with the
schema and test data and have everything go in a transaction.  That's what
our last workplace did and its not ideal.<br/><br/>Also that you say you can "kind of mock up transactions" is worrisome.  You're
not using transactions?!  Forget the implications for testing, a database
without transactions is... just stupid.<br/><br/>

into a callable library:<br/><br/>    main() if $0 eq __FILE__;<br/><br/>    sub main {
        ...code that was originally outside a subroutine...
    }<br/><br/>If you run the file as a program it will run main() and act like a program.
If you "require" the file it will not run main().  Then you can make
subroutines and test them.<br/><br/>Things like Test::Output are handy since programs like to print.<br/><br/>

prices off the resulting web page.  It calls C<$html = get_page($url)> and
C<@prices = find_prices($html)>.<br/><br/>price_scraper() isn't working.  Is the problem in get_page()?  Is it in
find_prices()?  Or is it in price_scraper()?  If get_page() and find_prices()
aren't tested you don't know.  You can't be sure if any of your dependent
routines work right.<br/><br/>price_scraper() returns the prices as formatted HTML.  In order to test that
you got the right prices you now have to scrape the prices out of the HTML.
This is annoying.  Testing at a lower level means you can avoid having to wade
through formatting and test just the functionality.  You can easily do a pile
of intensive tests on find_prices() and then do some cursory tests in
price_scraper() to show that the results from find_prices() are being
displayed properly.<br/><br/>Small methods are easy to test.  Their functionality is narrow and well
defined.  Big, user facing methods are hard to test.  They tend to do a lot of
things and have lots of weird business rules and lots of formatting.<br/><br/>Small methods get reused.  Testing them makes them more robust and thus makes
every place they're used more robust.<br/><br/>The desire to test small methods acts like an enzyme to break down large
routines into smaller ones which are easier to test.  Thus improving the
design, understandability and promoting opportunistic reuse.<br/><br/>

2) The Extract Method refactoring.<br/><br/>With just that one realization and one refactoring tool you can do a lot of good.<br/><br/>

"Enzyme" is an excellent analogy.  Thanks for that.  *files it away*<br/><br/>K.



<h2>Adding Testing To A Conversion</h2>

It's no secret that I'm a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/CLACO/Handel-0.99_17/t/" title="cpan.org">fan of tests</a cpan.org> <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/CLACO/Handel-Storage-RDBO-0.01_02/t/" title="cpan.org">and testing</a cpan.org>. Without tests, the big refactor and also the additiona RDBO layer would not be sane, workable, or stable. I drank the kool-aide long ago.<br><br>For better or worse, I'm the group lead for a conversion to<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET at work along with a big fat site redesign. The first thing we are doing once we have the class files laid out are writing tests. They've all heard my speech and seen the demos about testing, coverage, proactively ensuring things "work today just like they did yesterday in so much as we've described in tests".<br><br>There's no doubt that TDD/Unit testing is overwhelming at first glance. We've decided to take the incremental approach to tests.<br><br>Round 1: Just test the method/property signatures. If you expect X, but get Y and are supposed to throw and error/exception, test that. If you call method Foo and should throw an error if Bar is not set, test that. That's easy to follow without much confusion.<br><br>Round 2: Test code coverage only to see which methods/properties you havn't tested at all in the previous step. Don't obsess about the % number, just look for methods you haven't called.<br><br>Round 3: Test positive functionality. If you call Y and should get X back, write a test for it.<br><br>Round 4: When you fix a bug, write a test.<br><br>Round 5: When people are finally comfortable with it all, game on. Try to fill in the test coverage gaps.<br><br>It seems to be going well so far. I guess time will tell.

And Round 1-2 are at a point in the project where we're not writing the bulk of the code, just shelling out the structure. Rounds 3-5 are when we start actually making the classes work later.<br/><br/>I also blame Petdance for the Test Your Environment mantra. I've also started exposing people to writing test when things god wrong, outside of code problems. Something stops working on a server? Write a test to make sure it's working correctly [when it does]. Spending time inspecting a database to pinpoint some data problem? Write a test when the problem is fixed so you can monitor that it stays fixed.
