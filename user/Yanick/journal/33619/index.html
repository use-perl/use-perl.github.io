<p><p>On Saturday, June the 23rd, me and my lovely lady joined APIs before
friends, families and the Great Whitely-Bearded Hacker in the Sky
(He was even kind
enough to schedule some wicked light effects for the event).

Funnily enough, both the bride and the groom were wearing pearls
for the occasion (in my case, it was an heirloom tie-pin given by
the mother-in-law). As unforgivingly geeky as it is, I must
say I got a secret kick out of that. </p></p>

<h2>Perl syntax</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2007-06-28T11:10:57</h3>
That should be<p><blockquote> <div><tt>push @ISA, 'Married::Man'</tt></div> </blockquote> "," not "="

<p>Argh! I've corrected it, thanks! I think that I was to write 'push @ISA =&gt; 'Married::Man'', and kind of got distracted in the middle of it.</p> <p> (Or, that least, that's the less shameful explanation I can came with.)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the less shameful explanation thay&#8230; you can&#8230; came with? (&#8220;I can has ekzplanation pleas&#8221; or something?)</p>

<p> <i>"I can has ekzplanation pleas" or something?</i> </p>

<p>But of course.</p>

<p>You see, an indubitably shameful explanation for the typo
in the original subject of this post (namely,
<i>push @ISA = 'Married::Man'</i>) would be that,
for a however brief moment of madness,
I honestly considered that syntax to be
correct.</p>

<p>A slightly less shamefaced justification for the slip,
however, could be to maintain that the original
intent was pure (<i>push @ISA =&gt; 'Married::Man'</i>)
but led astray by circumstantial distractions.
To wit: an accutely
above-average
harebrained disposition due to the aftershocks
of a recent marital status upgrade, a narrow survival
of a massive invasion of rambunctious Teutonic hordes
(which has only been made possible by means involving the
sacrifice of unnumerable sausages to the charred altar
of the BBQ gods) and the vivid trauma of waking to the
alarm clock after one solid week of vacation time. </p>
<p>
Indeed, when this collection of boggling factors are taken into
account, I hope that it becomes apparent why my internal Perl,
not to mention English, parsers somewhat get a little
meltdownish.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) </p>
