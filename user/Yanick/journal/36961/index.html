<div class="span8">
<p><p>Everybody is raving about <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/stevan/Moose/">Moose</a> these days, but I must say that
I still prefer
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/jdhedden/Object-InsideOut">Object::InsideOut</a>.  One of the things I love about
OIO is its extensive documentation 
(70 glorious pages worth of pod!).  One of things that I find daunting about it is, 
well,
finding back the attribute I'm looking for as I thumb through
those seventy-something blasted pages. </p>
<p>So I made myself a 
<a href="http://babyl.dyndns.org/perl/oio/oio-cheatsheet.pdf">cheatsheet</a>. It's not 
complete yet, but it's already containing what most mortals 
would use on a daily basis.</p>

<p>(btw, I've used <a href="http://www.scribus.net">Scribus</a> 
to generate the 3-fold.  Although I really,
really want to like that software, I must say that it makes me
miss Quark XPress real bad.  If anyone has any suggestion for an
alternative Desktop Publishing tool, please feel free to let me know.)</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2008-07-20T09:55:41</h3>
<p>Just curious, why do you prefer OIO over Moose?</p>

<h2>Re:Why?</h2>

<p>
As I said, it's merely a preference. There's nothing that
I found so far that is a show-stopper or an overwhelming
advantage for any of them. This being said... </p><p>
The biggest plus of OIO, for me, is how inside-out objects ensure that
colliding fields are not clobbered, but masked:</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>package Foo;<br>use Moose;<br>has 'x' =&gt; ( default =&gt; 'foo', is =&gt; 'rw' );<br> <br>package Bar;<br>use Moose;<br>extends 'Foo';<br>has 'x' =&gt; ( +default =&gt; 'bar' );<br> <br>package main;<br>my $obj = Bar-&gt;new;<br>say $obj-&gt;x;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # prints 'bar'<br>say $obj-&gt;Foo::x;&nbsp; &nbsp;# prints 'bar'</tt></p></div> </blockquote><blockquote><div><p> <tt>package Foo;<br>use Object::InsideOut;<br>my @x : Field<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:Acc('x')<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:Default('foo');<br> <br>package Bar;<br>use Object::InsideOut 'Foo';<br>my @x<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:Field<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:Acc('x')<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:Default('bar');<br> <br>package main;<br>my $obj = Bar-&gt;new;<br>say $obj-&gt;x;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # prints 'bar'<br>say $obj-&gt;Foo::x;&nbsp; &nbsp;# prints 'foo'</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>
I know it's a little bit of a paranoid concern,
and it creates a little bit more work (as you have
to completly create two '@x's instead of overloading
the one from Foo in Bar),
but hey, it soothes the obsessive-compulsive in me.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
</p><p>
Another argument for OIO is that it claims to produces
accessors that are faster than the ones of the usual
blessed hash objects.  Now, it must be said that I
didn't benchmark that claim, so I can't vouch for it.
Nor do I really need blinding speed for the stuff that I
usually do.  But just like the guy shopping for BBQs, I'm
atavisticly drawn to the beast that boast the most BTUs.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>
There is also the documentation.  Moose's doc is getting good,
but it's still a little bit scattered and hard to put together.
OIO's, on the other hand, is very comprehensive.  It's also
a bit lenghty and hard to use a quick reference, but hopefully
my cheatsheet is taking care of that problem.</p><p>
And OIO can also play quite nicely with non-OIO objects.  You
can easily inherit of a blessed hash object (which could be a Moose object!),
and a lot of the
required magic will be done for you.</p><p>
On the other hand, Moose does offer a couple of features
that isn't in OIO  (being able to slap 'before' and 'after' pieces
of code around your parent class' methods, for example), but so far
I didn't feel the need for them.   </p>

<h2>It does look good</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jplindstrom/">jplindstrom</a> on 2008-07-20T14:32:55</h3>
<p>The first impression from the synopsis is that the syntax seems pretty comfortable.</p><p>And from what I could tell by browsing the docs it does deal with my biggest problem with inside-out-objects: debuggability.</p><p>With the dynamic typing in Perl, if I'm confused as to what I'm looking at it's essential to be able to dump the object data structure easily just to see what's what. I'm assuming (well, hoping) that's covered by the "Object Serialization" blurb.</p>

<p>It is covered.  And provided that your class is relatively
plain vanilla, the <i>dump()</i> method will do what you want:
</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>package Foo;<br>use Object::InsideOut;<br>my @x : Field<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:Acc('x')<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:Default('foo');<br>my @y : Field<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:Acc('y')<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:Default('bar');<br>my @z : Field<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:Acc('z')<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:Default('baz');<br> <br>package main;<br>my $obj = Foo-&gt;new;<br> <br>use Data::Dumper;<br>say Dumper $obj-&gt;dump;</tt></p></div> </blockquote>
