<p><p>
At $work, an application that I wrote (<i>remora</i>, a companion
application to <a href="http://www.wireshark.org">Wireshark</a>) 
is extensively using 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/atrak/NetPacket-0.04/">NetPacket</a>. 
NetPacket is very handy but, alas,  has 
<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=7010">some</a>
<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=18941">bugs</a>, 
and seem to be orphaned  (the latest update
is from 2003).  I've tried to poke the maintainers, but
Stephanie Wehner's email is no longer working, and Tim Potter didn't
reply yet (although, to be fair, I only began to poke last week).
</p>
<p>
Bottom line, I'm playing with the idea of taking over the module so that
I can churn a new version with the bug fixes.  So if 
anyone out there is in contact with Stephanie or Tim, can you let
them know a madman is nefariously organizing a coup?  Thanks. :-)
</p>

Once you've poked "A number of times over a number of weeks by a number of methods" apply to modules@perl.org for maintainership.<br><br>The "a number of methods" is of note here. If their old emails don't work, don't stop there. Try and track them down by Google, phone, etc if possible.

<p>Ayup.  I've made sure to go and read the full procedure on the CPAN FAQ. But thanks for the reminder!</p>

<p> <i>The "a number of methods" is of note here. If their old emails don't work, don't stop there. Try and track them down by Google, phone, etc if possible.</i> </p>

<p>I've already went down the Google road.  I didn't get any fresh scent, but got a few alternative old email addies.  With a little luck one of them will get through.  Ah, where are hacker hounds when you need them?  To think I would just have to shake a snippet of code under their noses and say "Go get'em maintainers, boys!"...</p>

Update: I've managed to track down Stephanie. Woohoo!  And she's not horrified at the idea of letting me be a co-maintainer of NetPacket. Double-woohoo!  Expect a Netpacket v0.05 to show up on CPAN Real Soon Now(tm).<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
