<p><p>(cross-posted from <a href="http://babyl.dyndns.org/techblog">Hacking Thy Fearful Symmetry</a>)</p>

<p>Ever since I've learned about the existence of
<a href="http://www.perl-magazin.de/">$foo - Perl Magazin</a>, I've
been awfully curious to take a peek at it.
Unfortunately, they don't ship subscriptions internationally.
So I went for the obvious workaround: I hunted high and low for
the loveliest German lass I could find, asked her to marry me,
and coaxed her family to get and forward me a subscription for
the magazine as this year's Christmas gift.
Worked like a charm.</p>

<p>
And it was worth it too.  The magazine is even better than
I expected, and it's high praises to the authors that
I  learned quite a few things from the articles even though
my German is still at a protozoic stage.  Whether you're a German
wanting to learn Perl, or a Perl hacker wanting to learn German,
I heartily recommend it.</p>

<p>And talking of Germany, I'll embark tomorrow on a three-week vacation trip across
the republic.  If there are any Perl mongers meeting this month around Duisburg,
Morsbach or Schwieberdigen who wouldn't mind having an AuslÃÂ¤nder in
their midst, please feel free to drop me an email. :-)</p>

Thanks for this journal entry<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
<br> <br>
But we do ship subscriptions internationally. So this shows that the website lacks of information about that. Thanks that you mentioned this... There is just one thing with international shipping: you have to pay the additional shipping costs (that differs from country to country).<br>
We had some issues with international zip codes, but we have fixed this.<br> <br>
Regarding your visit in Germany: There is one Perlmonger group near Duisburg - Ruhr.pm. I'll drop them an email...
