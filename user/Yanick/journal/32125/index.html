<p><p>One of my resolutions for the new year is to try and
see if I can stir Ottawa.pm back to life (it kinda went
under two year-ish ago). I've already sent a humble request
to the Power that Is at pm.org to get the keys to
the ottawa.pm.org website and mailing list. But still remains
the most daunting task: gather minions. I already spotted 11 
Perl programmers on meetup.com that would probably be interested.
And I should also be visiting the local LUG, always a fertile ground
for young llamas....
</p><p>
Anyway. No need to say, if you are in the vicinity and want to join
the fray, please feel free to frantically wave in my direction. 
If not, well, wish me luck. :-)</p></p>

Thanks!<br><br>Eh. I just checked, and it seems that you guys have not one, but two pm groups in Toronto: Toronto.pm and Seneca.pm. You lucky devils.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

You can contact me via the list or via my CPAN email  address CLSCOTT.

the presentation department.</i>
</p>

<p>Well, we'll see about that. I don't have any problem per se with a more
social-oriented group. After all, it all depends of the expectations
of whoever will want to show up. We might end up being a hardcore
technical group (on the program this month: a hard look
at the performance penalty of using s()[] over s///) or a more
lackadaisical bunch (on the program this month: same as last month;
we all drink beer
and try to woe baffled patrons of the Darcy with Perl poetry).
</p>

<p> <i>
The next biggest issue was where and when to meet, meeting space and projectors was always hard to come by.
</i> </p>

<p>Yeah, that's a biggy. Meeting space is not that much of a problem
if we don't need a projector. But if we want to present something, yup,
that's an issue. Hmm... when you had your reunion at the Main Library,
was it possible to rent a projector from them?</p>

<p> <i>
There is an existing emailing list that is mostly dormant but with a number of
subscribers.</i> </p>

<p>Wonderful. I just subscribed, thanks!</p> <p> And I just got news from one of the
Lords of PM.org. ottawa-pm@pm.org (http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/ottawa-pm
) and the ottawa.pm website (ottawa.pm.org) are officially back in business.
The plot, as they say, thickens.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p> <i>
As well assisting Jay Lawrence when he ran Ottawa.pm I am the listed organiser
for the Ottawa perl meetup (onMeetup.com) (which has never met).</i> </p>

<p>Oh, I see. I seen there was interested people on meetup.com, but I didn't
realized there was already an organiser. Sorry to have pondered about
hijacking your group.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p> <i>
I'd be happy to assist you in bringing Ottawa.PM back to life.</i> </p>

<p>Woohoo! And I'll be happy to take you to your word here. I'll need all
the help I can get, 'cause organising things is... well... not exactly
my forte.</p>

<p> <i>
P.S. There was always talk of why the famous Yannick never came to meetings,
even when personally invited</i> </p>

<p>I'd like to say that was because I was busy fighting the evil forces of Dr
Tickle around the world, or because -- Phantom of the Opera-like -- I was monitoring the city Perl activities
from deep within its sewer system. But the sad truth is that I
was suffering from a bad case of chickenshitism. It might shock many,
but I'm actually quite a coy creature, and the thought of having to give
presentations was enough to send me all a-shiver. Fortunately (or
not, depending of the point of view), I've learned better since then. &gt;:-) </p>

Ooops. Just found out that ottawa-pm@pm.org still redirect redirect to your mailing list. Good thing my test message was rejected by the latter.

Yup, I already found that little gem and studied it real hard before I made my decision to cross the Rubicon[*]. And I think I'll study it again and again in the next few months, as I'm not exactly what one may call a naturally born organizer...<br><br>[*] Rubicon... now, that'd be a cool name for the Ruby conferences. Someone should suggest them the name.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
