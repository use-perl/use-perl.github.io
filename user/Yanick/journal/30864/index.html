<p><p>
I'm afraid there is a dark and sinister conspiracy going on in
the Perl underworld, and that I misadvertently stumbled in the middle
of it...</p>
<p>I've heard rumors of it a few years back, but at the time I had
discarded it as nonsense. I mean, who in his or her right mind would
think something that big, that far-fetching, could be kept secret, and 
yet be true?</p><p>
But yesterday, I've read the same information, typed straight
from the fingertips 
of an undisputable source (which identity I of course wouldn't reveal, 
to keep him safe from harm): </p>
<p><i>Dahuts have their hands (err, hooves) in the AxKit project.</i></p>
<p>Yes. Dahuts. Those secretive animals decribed as half-llamas, half-yetis by
both scholars of mythical lore and slightly tipsies sailors in bars.</p>

<p>Incensed by that discovery, I tried to access one of the thomes
of knowledge on the subject. Namely: Acme::Dahut. But a critical, central
piece of information has gone missing. </p>
<p>Website downtime, or the
action of the Alpian Illuminati cabala trying to suppress information
to leak out to the public? I don't know, but one thing is for sure:
my great-great-grand-father's rusty yet thrusty musquet is loaded and
ready shoot any albino monk who will happen to wander down
my street...</p></p>
