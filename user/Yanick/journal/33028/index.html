<p><p>Don't get me wrong, I love perldoc. But for documentation that span 
several manpages, I often catch myself dreaming of tables of content,
indexes, real dead-tree margins on which to annotate stuff. I'm funny that
way.</p>

<p>So I went back to the script that I wrote to create the <a
href="http://use.perl.org/user/Yanick/journal/30715">XPathScript manual</a>
and tinkered a bit with it. I then used that newly-concocted black
magick (which basically convert and agglomerate pods into a docbook, which
is then LaTeXified and subsequently pdfed) to turn the 
<a href='http://search.cpan.org/user/jrockway/Catalyst-Manual-5.700501/'>Catalyst
manual</a> into a cute little <a
href="http://babyl.dyndns.org/misc/catalyst_manual.pdf">pdf</a>. 
Me likes. I think I'll tidy up the aforementioned script and 
publish it as Pod::Manual or something of the kin as soon as time (ah!)
allows.</p>

<p>(and yeah, I'm in the process of getting 
my feet wet with Catalyst. Last week I was hopelessly Not Getting It, but 
sometime during last week-end, an angel came to me and bapped me over the
head with its trumpet. Epiphany! I grok it, now! Even better:  I think I'm digging it too!)</p>

Pod::Manual::PDF<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>Way cool. Can't wait to get my hands on that script. I hate reading in perldoc. I usually just push it up to CPAN and read it when the indexer renders it all.<br><br>pod2html locally is a pitas sometimes as well.

Have you tried <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Apache-Perldoc/" title="cpan.org">Apache::PerlDoc </a cpan.org> or <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Apache-Pod/" title="cpan.org">Apache::Pod</a cpan.org>?

You may want to have a look at Pod::POM::Web : tree navigation, table of contents, href links, and fulltext index if you want.

Yeah, that does the trick. Thanks!

In addition of the other modules recommended by grantm and dami, if you want to generate CPAN-like pages for the pods of your own distros, there is Pod::ProjectDocs, which is not half-bad at all.

That looks totally great!  Seriously!<br><br>That's one more barrier to doing some Catalyst learning gone...

Assuming this get's refined, maybe syntac colouring, or at least ditch some of the pod parsing errors, I would love to see this on CPAN, or one of the related sites...where on could just go and get the latest Pdf version of the pod for a dist.

*blush* Thank you.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>And as I go through the document, I'm noting how the pods could be rearranged so that the flow is more logical, and take note of other pods that should be added to the collection. So expect a second version of the compendium in the near future.<br>
