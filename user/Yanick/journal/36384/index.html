<b>The person who introduced me to Perl showed me that</b> ... well,
in my case it's kinda of a spurious question,
considering that no-one really properly 
introduced me to the 
language.  At the time, I just happened to look around for a good
scripting 
language to learn and saw that Perl was one of the languages used by
some members of my team.  I bought the Camel book, dived in and...
the rest is pretty much history.</p>

<p>
<b>I first starting using Perl to </b> do small shell stuff.  If
I recall correctly, 
the first script I touched was a load balancer that was monitoring
a unix corral and launching
queued jobs on the less busy machines. Then I began
to use it to diddle text files (change 'class Foo' to 'class Bar' in
my source code, figure out how many functions are in each file, etc.). 
And then came the <a
href="http://www.tipjar.com/games/solitaire/wheels.html">Solitaire 500</a>.
My entry to the contest shamefully crashed and burn at the starting line, 
but 
I still managed to squeeze a t-shirt and a love of the language out of 
the experience. To this day, I still have both (although one is pretty much
due for replacement).</p>

<p><b>I kept using Perl because</b> it is so much damn fun. Most other
languages are like station wagon cars. They get you from A to B, but 
they are not much to write home about.  But Perl... 
Perl is like James Bond's car.  Beside the driving wheel, you
have a red button here to activate the flamethrowers. Below
the glove compartment -- yes, you see right -- there's a lever 
that engages the retro-propellers. And it doesn't end there:
if one was to ever 
get bored with all those nifty toys, Q still comes up regularly with 
new features.</p>

<p><b>
I can't stop thinking about Perl 
</b> for the same reason a rock star can't stop thinking about his 
Fender Stratocaster XII.  </p>


<p><b>I'm still using Perl because</b> I have yet to find another
language that is so delightfully idiosyncratic and yet so practical. 
Or
that has such a striving community. Or that has anything remotely 
comparable to
that magnificent temple dedicated to Aergia that we call CPAN.</p>

<p><b>I get other people to use Perl by</b> asking them what task they want
to achieve, and doing it before their eyes in a handful of lines. Once I have
thus acquired their awestruck attention, I reel them in for my 
weekly Perl Lunch'n'Learns where the true corruption can begin.  </p>

<p><b>
I also program in </b> TCL <b> and </b>Javascript<b>, but I like Perl better since
</b> it doesn't make me want to drive red-hot tetanus-laden nails through my 
prosencephalon.  Javascript is not that bad, mind you -- I actually like
it.  But nothing, <i>nothing</i>, can shear such deep gouges in one's psyche 
like badly written TCL can. And this is coming from someone who known
Intercal, brainf*ck and VisualBasic...
