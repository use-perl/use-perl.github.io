<p><p><b>Shakesphacker</b>: (<i>n.</i>) a programer who, at the instar of Shakespeare's infamous chimps,
   randomly bang on the keyboard until the laws of probability make him
   generate a working line of code.</p><p>

   I came up with that term Friday to try to put a label on a coding philosophy I
   observed.
   I'm not entierely satisfied by it though -- it sounds way too
   sophisticated for the kind of feeling it try to convey.  "Foo flinger"
   could be more adequate.
</p>

<p>In all cases, shakesphackers can be easily identified by their exuberant love of <i>eval</i>s -- they firmly believe that, just like violence, if it doesn't solve your problems, it's because your not using enough of it. </p></p>

<p>My first thought was that you were going to define the word as <a href="http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/romjul.php" title="albinoblacksheep.com">people who butcher Shakespeare by using l33tspeak.</a albinoblacksheep.com> </p>

<p><p><div class="quote">they firmly believe that, just like violence, if it doesn't solve your problems, it's because your not using enough of it.</div> This applies to more things than just eval. Object orientation, indirection, and regular expressions are other examples that spring to mind.

<p>Thanks. That was the most enjoyable perversion of the Bard's work
I saw since <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114733/" title="imdb.com">Tromeo and
Juliet</a imdb.com>.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>Agreed, although two of them are not current issues for me.
Mentioning OO to the shakesphackers I'm dealing with at the moment
only leave them slack-jawed and bovine-eyed, and they only use
baby-regexp speak (not that they have a choice, mind you, considering
that we are using TCL). Indirection is something that do cause problems,
like interpolation, and namespaces, and... oh, too much stuff to cover here.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) </p>
