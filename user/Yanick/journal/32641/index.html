<p><b>Background</b><br/><br/>Organizing the March meeting of <a href="ottawa.pm.org">Ottawa.pm</a>, I came across the problem that setting a date is pretty much like playing Battleship. If a specific date is proposed, people tend respond with boolean answers (can/can't come on that day), which is perfect to assess the punctual value of the attendency function, but quite lousy to determine its monthly optimum.  <br/><br/>So, taking the premise that there's no simple problem that can't be solved by an overcomplex solution, I thought about a way we could all signal our availabilities for a certain month in a simple, standard and easy to parse way (for I have evil plans to hack a script to help me do the scheduling). A few bus commutes later, MADness was born.<br/><br/><b>Meeting Availability Dialect</b><br/><br/>A MAD signature line has the following syntax:<br/><br/>        <i>month</i> : <i>availability</i><br/><br/>The month is simply the name of the month. Availability is defined by a sequence of tokens that add or remove available days, depending if they are modified by a plus or minus sign.<br/><br/>E.g.:<br/><br/>        April : WD + Sat - Wed - Day(13)<br/><br/>which means any work day, plus Satudays, but not Wednesdays or the 13th of the month. <br/><br/>The base token are:<br/><br/>Mon
Tue
Wed
Thu
Fri
Sat
Sun 
AD - Any day
WE - Week-end (same as 'Sat + Sun')
WD - Week days (same as 'Mon + Tue + Wed + Thu + Fri')<br/><br/>For a specific date, use Day(X), where X is the date. For example, 'WD - Day(14)' means all week days, except on the 14th (one can surmise that was for February).<br/><br/>To target a specific week, append '(X)' to the token, where X is the week in question. Several weeks can be given, separated by commas or a range operator '..'. For example, 'Tue - Tue(2)' is equivalent to 'Tue(1,3..4)' and means the first, third or fourth Tuesday of the month. <br/><br/>Availability is resolved from left to right, which means that, for example,<br/><br/>        April : AD - WE + Sun(1)<br/><br/>means any day, except week-ends, although the first Sunday is okay. Note that
this is equivalent to<br/><br/>        April: WD + Sun(1)<br/><br/>MAD doesn't consider whitespaces as significant. The full availability, however, must be represented on a single line.<br/><br/></p>
