<p>OK, so Ohloh has fairly junky stats.<br/><br/>BUT, for the subset of the overall numbers they do sample, their RELATIVE trends should at least be fairly useful as a source of information.<br/><br/>While doing a little comparative graphing, I uncovered this interesting gem (no Ruby pun intended).<br/><br/><a href="http://tinyurl.com/eeenteresting">http://tinyurl.com/eeenteresting</a><br/><br/>(As you can see, I also uncovered tinyurl's awesome vanity tinyurl feature) :)<br/><br/>Now, lets be clear what this graph shows.<br/><br/>Ohloh defines a "contributor" in these graphs as the number of distinct accounts who did at least one change to a file written in that language in that month.<br/><br/>The Ruby is there mainly as a curiosity, either it's jumped the shark now, or (more likely I suspect) a great big chunk of users has moved on to the Ruby'tastic github (which Ohloh doesn't know about yet, right?) this year.<br/><br/>More interesting are the two quite different trends.<br/><br/>One pair would seem to link the shell community with the Perl community, and the other links the Python community (apparently) to the PHP community.<br/><br/>Now CLEARLY (er, right?) the PHP and Python communities aren't inherently related as languages but they do represent the "new web/apps" to some degree.<br/><br/>And Perl and Shell may be somewhat related (although not necessarily tightly) but they are more accurately linked as the "sysadmin/command line" crowd.<br/><br/>Perhaps there's something going on here beyond just the languages themselves...<br/><br/>One positive note is that compared to the other languages in Perl's class (shell, c, etc) we've had a pretty good year, maintaining strong contributor levels when there's been some off crashes in the numbers for C, shell, Ruby etc.<br/><br/>Of course, being a egotistical bastard, I would prefer to attribute the detaching from our related languages to someone releasing a CPAN-capable Windows Perl distribution and drawing more non-Unix people into the maintainer pool. :)</p>

<h2>Is Perl source in there?  Or Backpan?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dagolden/">dagolden</a> on 2009-01-27T16:17:45</h3>
<p>Now that Perl is under git, is Ohloh tracking it?  And I wonder what would happen if RJBS followed through on his threat to port BackPAN into a repository form and then got Ohloh to track it.</p><p>Not that it would prove anything, but it's fun to thing about how Perl could game statistics to its advantage.</p><p>On a serious note, I liked your thinking about the "web dev" vs "sys admin" groupings.  Despite Perl's history and role in web apps, I suspect the meme that is largely a sys admin and data munging language does have some traction outside the Perl community bubble.</p>

<p>Yes, Ohloh is using git version of Perl.</p><p>It would be not hard to submit a project to Ohloh semiautomatically using Net::OAuth. Repository URL should be available in META.yml, only descriptions remains. I'm plannig to do similar thing for Freshmeat. Currently I'm doing an utility for adding a release to Freshmeat.</p>
