<div class="span8">
<p>With yesterdays release of Perl 5.10.1, I'm happy to report that the work on configure_requires is finally (FINALLY) officially "done".<br/><br/>It's not that the actual work wasn't finished.<br/><br/>But because it was a completely back-compatible change for all CPAN users that will require significant education, I felt that if we were going to ask the entire Perl userbase to upgrade their CPAN clients, it was important that we only asked them to do so once.<br/><br/>And for new users, we needed them to have support for it out the box.<br/><br/>Now that it is fully completed and in the core release of the current production-recommended Perl, we've finally reached the point where we can say to everyone:<br/><br/><i>"We've implemented a one-time backwards incompatible change to the CPAN. You will need to upgrade your CPAN.pm or CPANPLUS, but just once and after that it will self-upgrade"</i><br/><br/>So feel free to spread the world to mongers and lists and distros and anywhere else that might need to know. Everyone is going to need to do a one-time upgrade to get the "5.10.1 auto-upgrading toolchain".<br/><br/>The next round of updates to the CPAN will be far less trouble, and should be largely transparent. Two changes are confirmed and in development currently.<br/><br/>1. We are implementing the new "MYMETA" file to unify the communication mechanism between EU:MM/M:B/M:I and the parent CPAN client.<br/><br/>2. The META.yml will be transitioned from YAML to JSON (as will the new MYMETA.yml/json) to simplify the code needed to support them.
