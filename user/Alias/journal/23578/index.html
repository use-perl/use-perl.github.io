<p>Since apparently everybody else in the known universe has been posting to their blogs about how their talk was accepted at OSCON, I was feeling so left out that I just had to start a blog and do it as well.<br/><br/>For the record, I'll be pontificating on:<br/><br/>"PPI - Parsing, Analyzing and Manipulating Perl (without perl)"<br/><br/>"Code Metrics with CVS Monitor - Who is really doing all the work?"<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it would appear that my "Dualing Bozos" Perl/Python joint comedy talk with Anthony Baxter has yet to be accepted, which is a pity since it is looking like it is going to be hilarious.<br/><br/>We got the idea after a sort of spontaneous lightning talk war I had with Damian at YAPC.AU to do as big a talk as possible inside the 7 minute limit.<br/><br/>My last attempt was "CPAN Speed Dating", which involved a different lightning talk every 15 seconds on a strict timer for as long as possible, and went down very well. It would be great for something similar to happen at OSCON.<br/><br/>For the record, I was particularly impressed with Damian's "101 things I like about Perl 6" done at 1 slide per second :)</p>
