<p>After 6 months working through legal and technical hurdles with <a href="http://microsoft.com.au/">Microsoft Australia</a> and their hosting partner <a href="http://www.emantra.com.au/">Emantra</a>, and a month of beta testing, I'm happy to report that the CPAN Testing Laboratory is now open for general access.<br/><br/>The initial incarnation consists of 7 virtual hosts with the following operating systems.<br/><br/>1. Windows XP Professional<br/><br/>2. Windows Server 2003 32-bit<br/><br/>3. Windows Server 2003 64-bit<br/><br/>4. Windows Vista Ultimate Edition<br/><br/>5. Windows Server 2008 32-bit<br/><br/>6. Windows Server 2006 64-bit<br/><br/>7. Windows 7 Beta<br/><br/>These machines are intended for ad-hoc testing and development by CPAN authors, and currently all of them are configured for exclusive access by a single user (to allow for complete flexibility in testing).<br/><br/>I've set up a specific #msopensource channel on irc.perl.org to help authors coordinate their usage of the different machines and for administration purposes. If you would like a login to the testing lab, you can either join the channel of (If I'm not there) email me via my adamk@cpan address.<br/><br/>For the time being, to create an account I'll need your CPAN id, full name, and a unique password that you don't mind me (or any other admins) seeing.<br/><br/>Because the current lab is quite experimental (both for us and for Microsoft), the current plan is to observe how people use it over the next 6 months and improve it incrementally as needed.<br/><br/>Finally, thank you all for your patience over the last 6 months, and thanks in particular to the guys at Microsoft that helped spearhead this effort through to completion. Of particular mention out of the dozen people involved:<br/><br/>Cristoph Otto, Software Test Engineer, Microsoft Open Source Software Lab<br/><br/>Anandeep Pannu, Senior Program Manager, Microsoft Open Source Software Lab<br/><br/>Sam Ramji, Senior Director, Microsoft Open Source Software Lab<br/><br/>Lawrence Crumpton, Platform Strategy Manager, Microsoft Australia<br/><br/>Jorke Odolphi, Web Platform Architect Evangelist, Microsoft Australia

<h2>That... is amazing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/xsawyerx/">xsawyerx</a> on 2009-07-20T07:22:34</h3>
<p>Truly awesome!</p><p>Great job, Adam!</p>



<h2>Office</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jplindstrom/">jplindstrom</a> on 2009-07-20T12:33:39</h3>
<p>Is the Office suite installed?</p><p>(This is just out of curiosity, I probably wouldn't do any Win32::Word::Writer development regardless)</p>

<p>No. The working principle for the first generation lab is to run with nothing at all installed beyond the base installation of the OS.</p><p>This is mainly so that we don't accidentally block work on X because we installed Y which is incompatible.</p><p>There is a shared drive for holding installers on though, and if it is needed I can discuss getting access to various things.</p>

<h2>I think you deserve this...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/DiamondInTheRough/">DiamondInTheRough</a> on 2009-07-20T21:36:14</h3>
<p>Alias++!</p><p>Thanks much for the work you've put into this. I'm sure I'm not the only one that appreciates this, and I HAVE Win32 machines at home I can program on!</p>



<h2>Could cpantesters run smoke testing on these?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Tim Bunce/">Tim Bunce</a> on 2010-08-31T21:53:07</h3>
<p>There are relatively few smoke testing running MSWin32 systems.</p><p>Having automated smoke testing running on these 7 machines would be a huge win for Perl by significantly increasing the testing of CPAN modules on windows systems</p>
