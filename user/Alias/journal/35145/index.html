<p><a href="http://blogs.activestate.com/activestate/2007/12/merry-perl-mas.html">http://blogs.activestate.com/activestate/2007/12/merry-perl-mas.html</a><br/><br/>Darn! It looks like the ActiveState team has beaten me to the punch, releasing a new ActivePerl before I was able complete the new Strawberry Perl.<br/><br/>This caught me totally off guard, because the last few Perl releases it's taken a few weeks before the matching ActivePerl came out, so I thought I might have a few days leeway.<br/><br/>My HOPE, of course, is that this is a positive response to competition on their behalf.<br/><br/>Relatively shortly after the original Vanilla/Strawberry releases came out showing how to do MinGW integration, ActivePerl added the ability to use MinGW as well.<br/><br/>Now they've improved their release timing to within 24 hours of the official tarball.<br/><br/>Lets hope the positive competition continues. :)<br/><br/>P.S. I've uploaded Perl::Dist 0.5 which is the major new release of the build tools I've creating Strawberry with. Hopefully this version won't blow up the CPAN Testers boxes :)

<h2>Frustration</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2007-12-19T10:06:01</h3>
<p>I recently tried to install Strawberry Perl on my Windows box here at the BBC, but it failed drastically.  I was going to make a bug report, but got distracted and now can't recall the problem.</p>

<p>That's when I tried to switch to AS Perl and quickly remembered why I want Strawberry Perl to succeed.  Their build pages once again fail to make clear why a build failed, their issues with core modules kill me and I have strange failures for some of my modules where I can't debug them with their information.  PPM didn't work out of the box, I had no 'make', so I had to find nmake and then I realized that, like most companies, my computer is only a very expensive dumb terminal to run Outlook and Excel.  I said "forget it" and have no Perl installed on my box at work.  What's the point?  My editor of choice is PuTTy<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) and do all of my work on another box anyway.</p>

<p>That being said, I'm very glad you're still working hard on Strawberry Perl as some folks are still forced to work on Windows and I hope the competition for AS produces more positive results.</p>

Bug reports would be awesome...<br><br>The only failure I'm aware of at the present time of note is the Vista MinGW bug, meaning that Strawberry is not Vista-compatible.<br><br>Which is weird, because it USED to be Vista-compatible at beta 1 (the last Vista machine I had a chance to test on).<br>

That's strange, I've got Strawberry installed on my equally locked down box.<br><br>Maybe you needed to set up your HTTP proxy vars or something.
