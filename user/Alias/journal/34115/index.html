<p>What a week this has been.<br/><br/>So far in the last 7 days...<br/><br/>1. My laptop cable/transformer died (and the carefully conserved last charge has run out).<br/><br/>2. My main mail/web server in Melbourne has died and won't come up on reboot.<br/><br/>3. The light bulb in my bathroom died (which seems small, except that it's a bizarre fluorescent circular bulb of a non-standard size and I can't seem to locate a replacement).<br/><br/>4. My desktop computer's video card memory has gone corrupt with seizure-inducing  like results (fortunately I don't get seizures...)<br/><br/>5. I start a new business-hours job in a location that's tough to do anything useful at lunch, limited my ability to deal with much of the above.<br/><br/>6. And capping off the week, the Perl on the new servers is displaying the aforementioned zany threading behaviour. Added to the list of modules that spuriously fail tests on RHEL 4 ES Update 1 now is both Storable (thread failures and no weakrefs) and Clone (no weakrefs).<br/><br/>So please excuse me if bits of me disappear for a little while, I'm trying to get it back up and running as fast as I can.<br/><br/>Please Note: The ONLY reliable email for me at the current time is adamk@cpan.org.<br/><br/></p>

<h2>RHEL4u1?</h2>

If I'm reading this right then you probably have no control over the version of RHEL you are using.  If you do, you might want to bring it more up to date.  We're using RHEL4u3 (although I'm not sure why we don't have RHEL4u4) until we've thoroughly tested out RHEL5.  I do know that the Perl packages were updated in each RHEL4 update (but I suspect the cause is something different).

I do have SOME control over the version I'm using, but given that it's a corporate envinronment migration takes time.<br><br>And because part of my role here is to create a test suite for the existing application, currently there's little in the way of tests to verify a successful platform upgrade other than testing the whole app by hand for failures (which isn't an option given the amount of money moving through the application).<br><br>What version of the perl packages are you at?<br><br>Mine seems to be failing for perl 5.8.5 patch level 36.<br>

<p>I should try installing those modules.</p>

So, are you basically suggesting reverting the Perl version to the older one?<br>

No.  Chances are it's something else.

I got a bounce ("Relay access denied") from that email address on Monday, so perhaps even that one is problematic...

You probably would have, but I've moved it to point at a temporary GMail account as of when I posted this journal entry.
