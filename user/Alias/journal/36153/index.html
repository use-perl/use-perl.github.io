<p>(Brian, don't front page this)<br/><br/>Google has (very quietly) expressed an interest in the idea of funding work on CPAN modules that talk to various parts of Google. Exactly how that funding might be delivered (grants, a job, etc etc) is fuzzy. To quote "there'd be money there for it".<br/><br/>The "quietly" bit is that they DON'T want to make a official position for it, because they don't want to have to deal with a flood of job applications, both from the horde of frustrated Perl-savvy people in their sysadmin groups, and from outside.<br/><br/>What they want, as I understand it, is to be just sort of slipped the name for an CPAN author with lots of experience doing this sort of thing, or maybe an existing Google:: maintainer.<br/><br/>That is, if they are going to fund it, they want it done by one of the half dozen or so obvious people to do it.<br/><br/>I'm not interested in taking up their offer, but if you are the obvious choice to work on it, have a private word to either myself or Michael Schwern and we'll let the right people know.</p>

it kinda made the front page in the recent journals area! Any regular visitor would absolutely see it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br/><br/>anyway, good to hear this<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) hope a really good coder gets this offer

Being visible on the front page of use.perl.org in recent journals is fine.<br><br>Being a front page article on use.perl means getting mirrored to a zillion other places, which is entirely against the point of the journal entry.<br><br>Most of the people capable of doing the job will see it on recent journals.

<h2>Not interested, but...</h2>

I'm not personally interested, but this seems fishy: they advertise on the down-low, and are vague about compensation.  Presumably they hope to find someone maximally desperate and/or bored.  If they really want someone to write a good interface, they can post a job ad and pay market rates.  If they want to cheaply check the "supports Perl" box, they can go on doing what they're doing and hope someone does it nearly for free.

1. They aren't advertising. You'll note that I didn't say THEY approached ME. This is just me making a note that there's money there.<br><br>2. They didn't want to advertise because there would be too much interest.<br><br>3. I somehow doubt they want to do this cheap and nasty, they just want someone appropriate.<br>

<h2>Speaking of modules</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2008-04-17T05:09:49</h3>
I keep forgetting to tell you that Data::JavaScript::Anon is still broken in the CPAN index, and so we keep getting the old/broken version that treats 0 as an empty string.  Dunno best way to fix (having someone kick the index, or releasing a new version), but it's been busted a long time.<br><br>Speaking of modules and busted, I should get to some module updates of my own<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...

Good thing I pay attention, almost missed this.<br><br>D:JS:Anon 1.01 uploaded to try to flush out the problem.

<h2>You make it sound almost shameful.</h2>

I was interested in finding some folks who would be interested in contracting some cpan work for supporting our apis and such. Nothing nefarious or sneaky about it. There are some groups internally who are interested, and I'm trying to get an idea of what it would look like now.
