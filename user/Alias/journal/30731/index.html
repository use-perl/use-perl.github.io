<div class="span8">
<p>Audrey has just uploaded Module::Install 0.64 to CPAN.<br/><br/>The following upgrade advice for authors using Module::Install applies to this release.<br/><br/>* IF AND ONLY IF your Makefile.PL uses the auto_install() command for the intent purpose of having users be able to manually run Makefile.PL and have it launch CPAN.pm to install dependencies, you should upgrade to 0.64 and do an incremental release of your distribution. Module::AutoInstall was not launching CPAN.pm correctly, resulting in incorrect recursive install behaviour.<br/><br/>Authors who use auto_install() for the purpose of feature() support and do not need the manual installation support should consider upgrading, but this is considered optional.<br/><br/>Authors who do not use auto_install() do not need to upgrade.<br/><br/>Further to this, based on the experiences of a number of authors over the last few releases, we are now recommending that authors who do NOT explicitly need the auto-installation for manual builds, and are not using feature() or features() remove the use of auto_install if possible, as the the functionality provided is no longer essential, and removing auto_install will reduce the number of edge conditions your code may be effected by, particularly with respect to deep recursion.<br/><br/>This release also contains a small change to try and improve the behaviour of recursion under CPANPLUS. However, this is still considered a partial solution, and we are working with the CPANPLUS author to implement a more comprehensive solution.<br/><br/>With a bit of luck, this fix (once implemented) will also mean we can finally enable the new Module::Install::With extension, which will provide comprehensive support for detecting and integrating with all the various installation toolchain parts, in essence allowing us to finally truly play well <b>with</b> others.<br/><br/>Integration of this the With extension will allow us to move to 0.70, the next major subrelease.</p>

Hi Adam,<br><br>I just sent a patch for the CPANTS broken_installer metric to domm via RT. It now scans Makefile.PL for the use of the auto_install feature and reports versions prior to 0.64 as broken if it was found. If not, pre-0.61 is considered broken/old. Does that sound reasonable?<br><br>Cheers,<br>Steffen

Maybe...<br><br>It's a bit debatable, since the use of auto_install() is probably harmless (or at least mostly harmless) if it getting installed via CPAN.pm.<br><br>It's probably ok for now, since once<nobr> <wbr></nobr>::With gets integrated properly (meaning 0.70 and maybe a few releases after that to bed it down) we'll toggle everything to broken<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>Adam K
