<p><a href="http://ali.as/top100">http://ali.as/top100</a><br/><br/>The "Debian Most Wanted" list is my first attempt to mix in kwalitee metrics into the lists.<br/><br/>In this case, it takes the kwalitee metric distributed_by_debian, inverts it into a decimal 1 or 0, then multiplies it by the modules volatility score, in effect just filtering the list, but doing it more complex under the covers to experiment for later more complex indexes.<br/><br/>The numbers currently look to be extremely flawed, at the very least they ignore dual-life modules (I'll need to see if there's a way around this in the SQL, since all the lists are created purely from the database for reasons that will become obvious later).<br/><br/>There's also a ton of modules listed that I know for a fact DO actually have Debian modules, for some value of "Have Debian modules".<br/><br/>To deal with some backlash I'm starting to get about the lists, I've also put a large prominent disclaimer on the front page to indicate I'm not responsible.<br/><br/>Hopefully this will act as a recruitment channel for people to help domm out with the kwalitee metrics data :)</p>

<h2>Even they don't know</h2>

One of the problems with the data is that the Debian people cannot supply the full list of the perl modules.
<p>
Maybe this list will get them work a bit more on their end so we will have a better list.</p>

<p>I wasn't aware that the name was manually supplied by the debian folks.</p><p>If this turns into a terminal problem I'll probably kill this list.</p>

AFAIK some of the packages are maintained by the Debian Perl group - those are in the list - other are still maintained (or not) by individuals. These have other repositories and other formats and thus most of them are not in the automatically generated list.
<p>
They are in the long and slow process of converting more to group maintenance.</p>

<h2>Filtering out core modules?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brother/">brother</a> on 2009-02-17T07:22:59</h3>
Nice list, if we can manage to filter out the false hits. Filtering out modules shipped with perl would be a first step.<br/><br/>I hove no idea if these modules should really have the 'distributed_by_debiabn'-kwalitee set.
