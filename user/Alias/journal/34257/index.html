<p>Mucking around with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Devel::Leak::Object">Devel::Leak::Object</a> at work on Monday, I managed with very little effort to locate an object "leak" (we were loading a bunch of stuff in Apache child init handlers, instead of at startup time in the parent like we should have).<br/><br/>Immediately memory savings across 25 children? 600 meg! Multiplied by 5 boxes in the cluster. At the very least that should delay the need to add a new server to the cluster for a few months.<br/><br/>Inspired by the quick win, I've been trying to hook D:L:Object in deeper to the Apache server, to look for more leaking cases (our web app uses enormous amounts of ram, and despite it legitimately needing a lot for certain tasks, I'm thinking there's probably much more that isn't necesary).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, D:L:Object was originally written in the days when stringifying references to get information about them was still common practice, and as such if I try to load in the global bless/DESTROY hooks early, many many things explode violently due to IO/REF objects and stringification overloads in the 120meg of CPAN and company-specific modules that the server loads.<br/><br/>So with Ivor's permissions, I have taken over Devel::Leak::Object and done a complete rewrite using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Scalar::Util">Scalar::Util</a> instead of ref($object) string parsing, and adding support for things like single-param bless.<br/><br/>I've also covered a few extra edge cases using some evil code stolen from the ugly guts of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Class::Autouse">Class::Autouse</a>.<br/><br/>The new 0.90 release should appear on your CPAN mirror shortly. I encourage anyone interested in leak detection, caches, et al, to throw everything you have at it and see what you can still break.
