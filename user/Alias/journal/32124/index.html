<p>Next week is <a href="lca2007.linux.org.au">Linux.conf.au</a>.<br/><br/>One of the more interesting pre-conference occurances for me has been the surprising level of interest in <a href="http://ali.as/threatnet/">ThreatNet</a> (to be renamed very soon for trademark reasons).<br/><br/>With a number of other spam fighting methods starting to fail, people are on the lookout for new methodologies.<br/><br/>Which may well just mean that ThreatNet is no long ahead of its time.<br/><br/>How can you help me out?<br/><br/>Well, if you have access to a mail server (especially postfix, for which we have cut and paste settings), I'd really appreciate it if you were able to run an <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/adamk/ThreatNet-Bot-AmmoBot-0.10/bin/ammobot">ammobot</a> from now until the end of next week (the duration of LCA).<br/><br/>It's quick to set up and uses negligable resources (10meg of ram, no CPU and a few meg of bandwidth per day).<br/><br/>In particular, I'd very much like to be able to stand up at a lightning talk and show a rapidly scrolling list of events on the giant screen to the combined glitterati of the Linux world.<br/><br/>If you'd like help setting it up and testing, drop into Freenode #threatnet.</p>

<h2>This sounds dangerous...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2007-01-13T12:52:05</h3>
From the website:<p><div class="quote">When a computer goes "bad" and starts to hurt others, the first member to spot it spreads the word to all the other members, who can protect themselves against the bad computer in advance. </div> Urm... what if a bad computer starts to badmouth other, good computers? Soon enough, the whole of internet will go down, and that'll be the end of ThreatNet.
<p>I'm sure the blackhats will start attacking ThreatNet, as soon as it starts to be significant in fighting the zombie networks.</p>



<h2>That's all covered</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2007-01-13T17:12:05</h3>
These are known issues of course.<br><br>The operator of the network is responsible for securing the network.<br><br>And there isn't going to only be one giant network of course.<br><br>So it's more of an operational problem at this point, and we'll see how well things scale...
