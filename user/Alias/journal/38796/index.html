<p>After a <a href="http://google.com/">Google</a> search wasn't yielding much in the way of useful answers, I took it over to <a href="http://yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> to see if they could do any better.<br/><br/>With Yahoo's similarly clean search results page, and reasonable useful answers, I ponder why I don't use it more often (especially since they are a bigger supported of Perl than Google).<br/><br/>But even if they returned identical results, with identical utility, I think I'd still be using Google nonetheless.<br/><br/>The reason is that it's really quick and easy to type "google searchterm", even with only 2-3 fingers, because it involves two fairly close clusters of keys.<br/><br/>In comparison Yahoo has keys in three locations, requiring either finger stretching or more hand movement. And capital Y has to be about the most difficult of all letters to hit.<br/><br/>While not as important in my opinion as the sparse homepage (which makes it a much better place to send my parents, or grandparents, and know they won't get lost) I do wonder if the need to stretch more to type reduces the attractiveness of the alternatives.</p>

Do you seriously type names of search engines out? I just use bookmark keywords (so 'y search term', or 'g search term' work in the address bar) and have setup my default search engine to clusty (in stead of google).<br/><br/>Instead of waiting for companies to care about your fingers, you should do it yourself<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<p>Hrm... good point, maybe I should shorten my search query to "g"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p><p>Regardless, I think these are the sort of things that accumulate in aggregate.</p>

I do that too, and wanted to mention that, but you got there first. You can set up a keyword for a search engine in Firefox by invoking the right-click context menu on the search's input box.
