<p>It's time to give <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?IO::Scalar">IO::Scalar</a> the big goodbye. (well, at least after one last bug fix)<br/><br/>The problem is that it doesn't behave like an <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?IO::Handle">IO::Handle</a> properly. It's sorta kinda the same, but sufficiently different that you should expect it will break on you eventually.<br/><br/><a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?IO::String">IO::String</a> on the other hand, is smaller, lighter, doesn't come with 5 other related modules who's tests could fail and block you, and behaves EXACTLY like a filehandle, even down to its seek-past-end-of-file behaviour.<br/><br/>And more importantly, that means it actually works with modules like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Archive::Zip">Archive::Zip</a> that care about seeking. If you currently use IO::Scalar, your module won't work properly with Archive::Zip.<br/><br/>I tried porting over <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Archive::Builder">Archive::Builder</a> a couple of days ago as part of my own effort to move all of my CPAN modules over, and in that case it was a simple s/IO::Scalar/IO::String/ and everything Just Worked.<br/><br/>So if <a href="http://cpants.dev.zsi.at/dist/IO-stringy">your CPAN module uses IO::Scalar currently</a>, consider moving. It may seem a small thing, but it means your module will be able to Play Well With Others much more cleanly.<br/><br/>That is all. :)</p>

<h2>No need for either</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2006-05-07T08:42:03</h3>
Since 5.8.0, Perl can do this natively:<blockquote> <div><tt>&nbsp; open my $fh, '&gt;', \my $str;</tt></div> </blockquote>That does the same thing as IO::Scalar and IO::String.

<h2>Too many caveats...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2006-05-07T11:42:07</h3>
That approach is fine if you don't care about anything older than 5.8.0 (which rules out all non-Unicode CPAN modules).<br><br>While CPAN is just barely turning the corner and discarding 5.005 and use 5.6 as the new base version, it's nowhere near ready for a 5.8 minimum.<br><br>Now for another few years at least.<br><br>And worse, you can't validate the damned things either.<br><br>DB $str = 'foo';<br>
