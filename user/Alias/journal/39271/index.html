<p>Dear LazyWeb.<br/><br/>The FAIL 100 list has been working reasonably well, but one crucial downside at the moment is the need for people to actively monitor it (both those that are aware that it exists, and those that don't know it exists).<br/><br/>While I certainly agree that it is a bad idea to spam authors in general (I'm certainly for opt-in CPAN Testers summaries and emails) does this still hold true when you are identifying only a small number of authors.<br/><br/>Would it be ok to auto-email the Top 10 positions on the FAIL 100 list, say, each week to let them know their module is considered to be important to fix quickly?<br/><br/>What if it's just the first time it appears, and on subsequent sequential appearances we don't email you.<br/><br/>What if it was the top 5? Or the top 2? Or top 1? Or only if you met a certain threshhold of FAILure score? Or it was at a wider interval, say, monthly?<br/><br/>When is it ok for a whole-CPAN process to judge that an author needs to be nudged?</p>

<p> Is this a rhetorical question? Human judgement of course, on a
case by case basis. When you send the automatically generated emails
all to yourself and read them and do the best of all possible efforts
to <b>judge</b> the situation and only then forward those manually
that have passed all possible filters. I mean permanently adjusting
filters according to gained insights during the review process. Then
you will still find people who disagree with you but that's just fair
because you have done your very best effort. And that's the only thing
that counts. </p><p> I'm with chromatic here because I'm probably 10000 times more
annoyed by spam than you are. My tolerance against self appointed
importance sheriffs is quite limited. Why can't you just publish your
wonderful statistics and let people subscribe who care enough? You
should rather deny the right to email authors on the basis of being on
the list. Prevent spam instead of asking for the right to spam.</p><p>Other readers may wonder what I'm talking about: I looked at the
list twice and both times the number one hit was obvious nonsense. I
mean the formula is really pretty weak. It gives a good guidance when
you have plenty of tuits and don't know where to invest them. That's
what I recommend these lists for. The hope that the false positives
will vanish has not much reason.</p>

<h2>Can you hook CPAN Testers preferences?</h2>

<p>Unhelpful answer: if you personally write each email, and it's not automated, then I don't think of it as spam, because there's a built in scale limit.</p><p>Helpful answer: CPAN Testers has a preferences website: <a href="https://prefs.cpantesters.org/" title="cpantesters.org">https://prefs.cpantesters.org/</a cpantesters.org>  I would suggest talking to Barbie about how you can hook into that and find author contact preferences.  Since FAIL 100 is really CPAN Testers data weighted by a dependency graph, it would make sense to use the same set of contact preferences.</p><p>Bonus: authors who complained historically before the preferences were set up had the contact bit switched off so you'll start off without annoying anyone.</p><p>-- dagolden</p>

<p>True.

<p>There is no general purpose agreement that by uploading something to PAUSE you grant permission for anyone with spare time and the desire to analyze what you uploaded has the right to send you automated e-mail as he or she sees fit.</p><p>That fails the categorical imperative test.

<blockquote><div><p>There is no general purpose agreement that by uploading something to PAUSE you grant permission for anyone with spare time and the desire to analyze what you uploaded has the right to send you automated e-mail as he or she sees fit.</p></div> </blockquote><p>Can we agree that uploading to CPAN is an act of publishing, ie. that it means that the author expects other people to take notice of the existence of the code, at a bare minimum? Can we further agree that reasonable people who upload code to CPAN will expect that other people may even go so far as to <em>use it</em> if the uploaded code turns out to be useful to them? If so, then when should agree that we can assume that authors would not be surprised that there may be users who come to depend, possibly even for their livelihood, on those uploaded things.</p><p>We should, then, agree that by virtue of the licence on those published uploads, if not for any other less technical reason, these users have the right to pursue their interests as far as the thing they have downloaded is concerned &#8211; and note here that I am not saying this implies any obligation to support this on the author&#8217;s end, merely a right on the user&#8217;s end.</p><p>Then if we want to get really serious about authors having no obligations, we would have to get really serious about being able to relieve them of obligations where they intersect with users&#8217; own rights: it needs to be trivially easy to fork and fix their crap in place.</p><p>Because either you keep social control of your work and then you accept the social obligations, or you give up social control and avoid the social obligations. It is your right to refuse the obligations. You cannot have one without the other, though. **</p><p>(When I talk about social control, I mean <em>effective</em> control. Eg. you could upload your code with a disclaimer saying that no one should use it and you should not expected to conform to the common implications of the act of uploading code to the CPAN. This is merely a form of shedding social control ahead of time, because licence permitting it merely means any interested and able party will fork your code as soon as they realise that doing so will save them enough trouble compared to alternative strategies.)</p><p>Now, as an author I can tell you that it would be a far bigger offence to me if someone dangled the fix-it-or-lose-it hammer in front of me than would be the possibility that I may be one of the <em>10 out of 6,000</em> authors who receive one an automated mail every once in a very long while.</p><p>And Adam has already said he is even going to seed the notifier with the existing CPAN Testers prefs database.</p><p> <small>** This, btw, is exactly the point of contention between the GPL and the BSDL.</small> </p>

Yet I'm sure some people could find better things I could do with my time than pick up candy wrappers in the park, if you check my bug queues.</p><p>It might even be good for the Internet as a whole if you wrote a spider program to email webmasters when their links go out of date.

Anyone reading this has the imagination to produce a CPAN service which, when squinted at from a certain angle, absolutely <em>requires</em> automated bulk notifications of CPAN authors.

By the act of uploading itself, you implicitly declared that your intent was in fact the opposite of such a sign. If it were forbidden to attempt a reasonable non-literal interpretation of the extent of what such an intent might allow for, and instead everyone had to consent to every specific treatment, then that would make questions of ethics very simple as they would not come up in the first place; it would also make the world a lot simpler, as nothing would ever get done.</p><p>This is especially true if the question is how to ask consent of someone who never consented to be asked for consent, and who did not consent to things that they couldn&#8217;t know about because they weren&#8217;t yet invented or even conceived.

And the rate of invention of such systems is infinitesimally low, so that angle won&#8217;t support a Categorical Imperative argument against it either.
