<p>Ever since my university days I've been trying to get rid of Windows.<br/><br/>I hated it's flakyness, I hated bluescreens. But Linux 2.2 distributions weren't particularly useful, and hey they didn't play games, which came out mostly for Windows.<br/><br/>And although Linux desktops have been getting better over the last 7 years since I first tried out Gnome 0.2, Windows has been getting better at a fast enough rate that it's still "another 6 months" till I try again.<br/><br/>Of course, on the server it's a total non-issue, and I've been a happy and contented Debian Linux user for over 5 years now. And since I write Perl for server applications, it's all good there.<br/><br/>Of course, the odd way I have my life set up means while I write Perl all day, I don't actually have Perl installed on my development machine half the time. I just load and save straight onto a samba share on the debian server using an editor (Ultraedit) that knows how to work with Unix newlines transparently and how not to break them.<br/><br/>And it's save, refresh. And it all works. Or for non-web there's PuTTY, which is just about perfect.<br/><br/>In a (Perl) world where most of the elite run on FreeNIX or (lately) Mac OS X, my persistance in sticking with Windows means I get to be the focus of the odd jibe or two (mostly from Macites who've been drinking the koolaid a bit too much)<br/><br/>To which my continuing response is...<br/><br/>WORKSFORME<br/><br/>Windows (200o and XP) doesn't crash for me.<br/><br/>Once you turn the eye candy turned off, the GUI is fast as hell, crisp, clean, and without any distracting shiny coating like Mac has.<br/><br/>I use Firefox instead of IE, Thunderbird instead of Outlook, and OpenOffice instead of Office. The Microsoft applications suck way more than the main OS does.<br/><br/>Without those in use, it turns out I don't need virus scanners either. I haven't got a virus on my main 2000 desktop ever. I install a virus checker every 6 months or so to double check, but it's been a clean result every time (except for one scary instance that turned out to be Skype talking to some weird places).<br/><br/>So I stick to the status quo, and what WORKSFORME.<br/><br/>Except today, I finally got my first bluescreen on my Windows XP laptop. Kernel panic. Completely out of the blue. Ouch. Something in atapi.dll... hmm... oh dear.<br/><br/>Reboots ok, but just in case I'll just copy off those photos I pulled off the camera but won't be backed up for another 4 hours.<br/><br/>Waiting waiting... freeze. Loud hard-drive CLUNK noise. Crap.<br/><br/>And so ended the life of my laptop hard drive, holding three months of photos, 4 hours before the backup cycle.<br/><br/>So while I'm somewhat pissed that Windows doesn't use the SMART stuff in the BIOS properly yet (or so it would seem) at least I can continue to say....<br/><br/>Windows. WORKSFORME.<br/><br/>I only wish I could say the same about hardware :(<br/><br/></p>
