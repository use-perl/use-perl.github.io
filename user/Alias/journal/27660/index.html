<p>Ever since I first tried to write one, the Bundle:: modules have annoyed me.<br/><br/>They ignore your Makefile.PL, use a magic POD format, require special implementation in the CPAN clients, are now LESS functional that the normal installers from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Install">Module::Install</a> or <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Build">Module::Build</a>, and are cludgy to impossible to use outside of CPAN.<br/><br/>They are also confusing for newbies, and I've met a few people that intitially assumed that the actual dependencies were somehow "bundled" into the dists.<br/><br/>I've wanted to replace Bundle with something more sane for a while, but the main problem has been the Bundle:: itself is detected and abused automagically by it's namespace, with the "Bundle" string itself triggering internal logic, so having a replacement would involve moving to another namespace.<br/><br/>Do you have any idea how hard it is to pick one. It stumped the modules@perl.org mailing list when I asked... just consider the potential confusion from any of these potential replacements.<br/><br/>Collection::
Batch::
Assembly::
Bunch::
Set::
ModuleDependencySet::
etc
etc<br/><br/>In fact, the enterprising person who suggested Bunch:: did a thesaurus search for Bundle:: and Bunch:: was the ONLY one that didn't already have some form of alternative meaning.<br/><br/>So today it finally occured to me that an equivalent to what Bundle:: does already exists, in the form of the "task" series of debian packages.<br/><br/>These are just normal-looking-packages with a bunch of appropriate dependencies, and with the ability to have something custom in the installed if you want.<br/><br/>And so I'm introducing Task:: as a successor to Bundle::<br/><br/>A Task:: distribution has ZERO special or magic functionality.<br/><br/>Rather than a .pod file, a Task:: module has a normal .pm with no code and just a $VERSION, and POD describing what it does, so that if you really want to, you can still load Task::Foo in in your program and check that it's $VERSION is new enough to match what you want.<br/><br/>The dependencies are implemented in the Makefile.PL/Build.PL as normal, and you have all the normal access to optional modules or checks for system tools. You can add an extra module dep on Win32, or even use test scripts.<br/><br/>You can pack up a private Task:: distribution and email to a sysadmin to make sure he installs the correct modules you need for your CGI application.<br/><br/>Task:: is a case of replacing a special feature with just a convention, and gaining more power and flexibility in the process.<br/><br/>I've provided what I hope is enough documentation in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Task">Task</a> itself, and if anyone wants to see an example of a Task distribution for a web application, see <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Task::CVSMonitor">Task::CVSMonitor</a> for an example. (grab the dist tarball itself and look inside)<br/><br/>If the Task modules haven't made it to search.cpan yet, they should shortly.<br/><br/>I'm not suggesting that everybody go out and convert their Bundle:: modules straight away, but the option is now there if you want it.<br/><br/>To forward port a Bundle:: to a Task::, create the Task::Foo dist, and then alter the Bundle::Foo dist to load Task::Foo and nothing else.<br/><br/>Comments are welcome. However anyone who doesn't like Task:: should suggest a better alternative, because I'll be damned if I can't think of anything better :)</p>

BundlePLUS?<br><br>Like CPANPLUS will eventually replace CPAN.pm, BundlePLUS will eventually replace Bundle?<br><br>Task is an atrocious name for this system. The word Task does not conjure anything o do with bundling modules in my mind

Yes, good idea.<br>But the name is appalling.<br>Try:<br>o Briefcase<br>o Satchel<br>o Fist (in English we can say 'Make a fist of it'<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br>o Ingredients<br>o PerlBase<br>and so on.

Except that Bundle doesn't really "bundle" the modules either. Things like PAR "bundle" the modules into the package.<br><br>All these other suggestions aren't great either, and therein lies the problem.<br><br>The main things Task has going for it is that it is at least closer to what a bundle currently actually is than "Bundle", it's better English that something like Satchel so that non-native speakers won't get confused as easily, and there's a precedent for using it in this way, as a list of other modules to install.<br><br>
