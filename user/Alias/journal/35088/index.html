<div class="span8">
<p>Some time after Audrey got <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Signature">Module::Signature</a> usable, mysterious 00-signature.t test scripts started appearing in distributions.<br/><br/>I noticed mostly because they were a major source of testing failures on Win32, because it generally doesn't have gpg support, and goes on to install a hideous dependency chain of the disgusting swamp of Perl's crypto modules, which almost inevitably fails to install.<br/><br/>It didn't occur to me until later that 00-signature.t isn't actually useful.<br/><br/>While CPAN's normal checksum mechanism protects against accidental file corruption, the purpose of Module::Signature is to cryptographically verify that a module was released by a specific author.<br/><br/>There's clearly some major problems this approach.<br/><br/><b>1) Trivially exploitable</b><br/><br/>Most glaringly, if a hostile entity does attempt to modify a distribution, the very first thing they will do is to delete the 00-signature.t file, or modify it to make it return success.<br/><br/>The very concept of using potentially exploited code to test whether that code has been exploited is utterly irrational.<br/><br/><b>2) Duplicated Functionality</b><br/><br/>The CORRECT place for verification testing is in the CPAN client, and indeed CPAN.pm (and I assume CPANPLUS as well) has Module::Signature support (although it doesn't install it by default any more due to the aforementioned buggyness).<br/><br/>So even if signature testing IS possible on that host, the use of 00-signature.t becomes superfluous.<br/><br/><b>3) Source of Waste</b><br/><br/>If 00-signature.t was only duplicating, but had perfect installability and was entirely bug free, it would merely be a design flaw with no major impact.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, signature testing is also a support of bugs and test fails in various places, generates spurious FAIL reports for modules, and is basically just a source of make-work.<br/><br/><b>4) False Sense of Security</b><br/><br/>Worse still, the existance of 00-signature.t files may lead users to believe they are being protected, when this is not the case.<br/><br/>It also lets authors tick off a box and move on incorrectly, when the REAL focus for improving security should be in the hideous dependency chain for Module::Signature.<br/><br/>To summarize, I think this practice is one we need to stamp out.<br/><br/>I'd like to see a kwalitee point docked if a signature test exists in a distribution, and some education work done to help educate authors about this misfeature.</p>

<p>Of course the real mechanism to verify signatures is out of band. The command that does it is <code>cpansign -v</code>. The <code>00-signature.t</code> file simply does the equivalent of <code>cpansign -v</code> to verify that it actually works.</p>

<p>Just like tests generally just verify that something does what it intends to do.</p>

<p>Imagine that an author signs his work wrongly. During <code>make disttest</code> he will notice the bug and has a chance to fix the thing before releasing. Just like with any other test.</p><p>

In which case never, under any circumstances, should this test EVER run during installation.<br><br>It should be a compulsory skip, unless something like AUTOMATED_TESTING of AUTHOR_TESTING is enabled.<br>

Correct. It was intended as a convenience measure for "make disttest", that's all.
<p>
The standard boilerplate 0-signature.t (as documented in Module::Signature's POD) has this opening:</p><p><blockquote> <div><tt>if (!$ENV{TEST_SIGNATURE}) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; print "ok 1 # skip set the environment variable TEST_SIGNATURE to enable this test\n";<br>}</tt></div> </blockquote> Which satisfies the compulsory skip requirement via the environment variable TEST_SIGNATURE.

Do you think it's necessary to have its own TEST_SIGNATURE flag?<br><br>If the contexts in which it should be used are clear, perhaps it would be better to flag in on AUTOMATED_TESTING or a context-appropriate flag.<br>

I write you this way because mail seems to fail and your post on my blog is to old that a reply would be noticed by you.<br><br>First thanks for attention. I really push it now for CPAN release but please notice that i have a little different viewpoint on some things.<br><br>I really admire you skills to carry out loads of modules in high quality but please trust me GUI-User apps are different territory. I impeled myself the last 2 month and did nearly every day a nightly release. i cleaned up shitloads of nasty details and bugs, updated docs, rounded up features, because i believe that without a real good 0.4 release we don't get much far.<br><br>Its also because i use it on daily and only if im satisfied with its progress i have motivation to work on. I have many many things to synchronize in my head. Even with name found (with help of a gifted girl driend of mine) and the new web site is online, there is even much pressure left: - the final switch to you install system, -cpan upload - the config dialog (last big important feature toward 0.4) - keep my user happy<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.. and so on all very important to me.<br><br>But I try to synch that with my other stuff and if you forgive me, i forst want to test how it is to release something on CPAN with a minor update of Perl6::Bible which i took over from audrey long time ago. i just managed to day come around some troubles and install Module::Signature from a older ppm (sorry could'nt use vanilla) to start this effort.<br><br>best<br>herbert

Module::Signature is not necessary to release to CPAN.

im not that experienced but P6bible has a signature file. to generate the new sigs i thought i need Module::Sig.

It's not strictly needed for you to release with a signature file, even if Audrey does.<br><br>This is especially so if you are in Windows, as the support for Module::Signature on Win32 is weak.
