<p>I've just uploaded <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?YAML::Tiny">YAML::Tiny</a> 1.21 to the CPAN.<br/><br/>This release fixes a major bug in the serialization that caused any unprintable character (which includes newlines and tab) to be serialized to a reference, which then stringified to REF(memorylocation).<br/><br/>Anything using YAML::Tiny for light weight serialization of arbitrary data is strongly recommended to upgrade.<br/><br/>The root cause of this bug was a trivial typo, with the primary cause attributed to a lack of unit tests (or even sample documents) for unprintable characters, which would have otherwise caused the problems to be picked up by routine round-trip testing.<br/><br/>This has also been resolved.<br/><br/>This bug was also the underlying cause of the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CGI::Capture">CGI::Capture</a> TERMCAP bug.<br/><br/>A new release of CGI::Capture has been uploaded with an updated YAML::Tiny 1.21 dependency to resolve the TERMCAP problem.<br/><br/>This is the final dependency issue preventing a 1.00 release of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?TinyAuth">TinyAuth</a>, which I hope now to complete shortly, after a little more polishing of error handling and the installation code.</p>

At least YAML.pm and YAML::Syck are aiming to be compliant with the YAML spec. If I find a problem with one of these modules, I can look into a spec and decide if it's a bug and file a report. With YAML::Tiny it's difficult to tell whether it's intended or a bug.
<p>
About the JSON-subset: where can I read this? I grepped the documentation and could not find a reference to it.
</p><p>
I am not against a tiny implementation of YAML, but it should go together with a tiny spec.</p>

As to that message, I believe we ended up with the position that for the purposes of the core, it was just fine to call it something like CPAN::ParseMETAyml or whatever, as long as it implemented something similarly light to the read half of YAML::Tiny.

Perl doesn't have a formal spec, either, yet it seems to acquire its fair share of bugs<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:)</tt>.

<p> <tt>YAML::Tiny</tt> has a perfectly decent (informal, implicit) spec:

</p><ol> <li>if <tt>write_string</tt> is passed any Perl data structure consisting only of unmagical scalars, arrays and hashes, produce a spec-compliant YAML document representing it which can be parsed by <tt>YAML::Tiny</tt> or any more complete YAML parser;</li>

<li>if <tt>write_string</tt> is passed any other Perl data structure, report an error saying so;</li>

<li>if <tt>read_string</tt> is passed any spec-compliant YAML document, <i>either</i>
<ol> <li>parse that document correctly and return the corresponding Perl data structure, <i>or</i></li>
<li>report an error that this document is unsupported and a more complete parser should be used;</li>
</ol></li>

<li>if <tt>read_string</tt> is passed anything that isn't a spec-compliant YAML document, report an error saying so.</li>
</ol>

<p>Any other behaviour, such as Adam has just fixed, is a bug. The only thing that might be useful is documentation of which cases get 3.1 and which get 3.2.</p>

The elements that belong in 3.1 SHOULD be something like "any block-mode YAML content that resolves to the classes of Perl structures supported by write-out".

<p>I suppose that depends on your definition of the words <em>incomplete</em>, <em>correct</em>, <em>usable</em>, and <em>specification</em>.</p>

YAML looks simple, but is actually a bloated nightmare.  Implementing the full YAML spec is tedious and difficult.  Most uses of "YAML" actually use only a small subset.  YAML::Tiny tries to implement this small, simple subset.  I'm not sure why you find this so hard to understand.

&gt; YAML::Tiny tries to implement this small, simple subset.<br><br>If you read the manpage from the first to the last line you still have no idea what this small, simple subset actually is. Whenever you have a small, simple YAML file that fails, or a small simple perl data structure that cannot be represented in YAML via YAML::Tiny, you cannot tell if it fails because of a bug or if it fails because the author has chosen to not implement some aspect of that small simple YAML file or that small, simple perl datastructure.<br><br>This is why I said: we have here a module that is unable to say what it does. And whenever a module does not say, exactly, what it does, we cannot tell if some behaviour is a bug or correct behaviour.<br><br>This has nothing to do with the perception of YAML being bloated or not. I'm not opposed to having some Tinyyaml spec that is (presumably) less bloated than YAML. But somebody has to write it and thus prove that it is worth the effort. Simply saying that doing less is better is not enough, the behaviour of the lesser implementation must be specced too. Otherwise it is unusable because unpredictable.<br><br>I hope this clarifies what I tried to say in my provocation.

I see your point, but I'm more willing to have the line between "bug" and "outside the spec" be negotiated between author and user.  Many specs are so hairy that in practice you can only deal with them by having a general idea of their intent, then trying stuff to see what breaks.  I haven't read the HTML 4 spec (746 KB of text), don't plan to, and couldn't remember it all if I did, but I can still hack together a webpage based on my rough understanding.

<p>The same goes (for me) for YAML::Tiny -- I'll use it for the simple stuff where it works, and deal with any breakage when I see it.  YAML's in a unique position here, because it tries harder than most markup to look simple, but it is also formally specified.  Kind of like English -- I usually get it right when speaking it but, even as a native, I don't pretend to remember all the rules.</p>
