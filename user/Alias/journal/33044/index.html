<div class="span8">
<p>I'm currently working on a project that has a scheduling element to it.<br/><br/>While I admit I dislike learning new languages, this is mostly for practical reasons. I don't like having to start from scratch on a new language, so I can solve the same problems I can already solve in a language I know.<br/><br/>But I'm smart enough to know when a problem has Perl beaten, so I've been looking for a way to write my scheduler. Prolog looked like the easiest way, and AI::Prolog already exists, so integration with Perl would be trivial.<br/><br/>After talking to a few people, jjore came back with a complete program to solve my sample schedule in a language I'd never heard of, called Oz.<br/><br/>The code is remarkably legible, and I can see how I'd be able to extend it in the ways I'll need down the track, and the codegen required looks like it should be simple enough.<br/><br/>So I'm looking into learning some Oz basics.<br/><br/>Installation was a breeze. apt-get install mozart on debian, and a downloadable installer on Windows. So things are looking good, and all the clues of sanity are there.<br/><br/>Until I hit the tutorial...<br/><br/>Because I have to say, Oz has the most horrid tutorial introduction I've ever seen.<br/><br/>After spruiking the language in the introduction, it suggests to run the "oz" interactive programming environment.<br/><br/>So I run it... to be faced with what is a modified EMacs editor with extra integrated stuff, and that spawns off Tk windows for some tasks. I'm completely lost, I don't even know how to quit, and eventually kill the terminal in disgust.<br/><br/>In fact, the entire first three or four sections of the official tutorial are written based on the assumption you are an competent EMacs user.<br/><br/>So ok, I'll just use the compiler to manually build things and execute them instead.<br/><br/>Except the programs in the tutorial don't work!!!<br/><br/>Take their "look how simple hello world is in Oz" example.
<code>
{Show "Hello World!"}
</code><br/><br/>Simple enough... except that not only isn't that a legal standalone program, but "Show" is a command built into the editing environment! :(<br/><br/>2 hours later, after skimming through the entire tutorial to try and find clues, I get something that will actually compile, execute and print out Hello World, it turns out hello world ACTUALLY looks something like this.
<code>
functor
  import
    Application
    System
  define
    {System.showInfo "Hello World!"}
    {Application.exit 0}
end
</code><br/><br/>This looks NOTHING like the example provided in the tutorial.<br/><br/>If swear to god if I didn't need a constraint language for this scheduling code I'd have junked this language in disgust, never to look at it again.

<p>Don't you think a lot of that is probably frustration due to being unfamiliar with how things are done in this new environment?</p>
<p>It does look interesting at first glance, in any case. Thanks for the pointer.</p>

Being forced to use EMacs is not "a new environment", it's having religion imposed on you.<br><br>Any language that forces you to use a particular editor needs to die a slow and painful death.<br>

<p><div class="quote">It does look interesting at first glance, in any case.</div> Well, just looking at the Hello World program, I see nothing at all that even remotely peeks my interest. It looks like just more of the same old cruft.<br><br>Perhaps the rest of the language is more interesting, but I don't see any of that here.

You don't want Oz as a general purpose language. Its no good at that. You want it because it has nice ergonomics for constraint solving, parallelizing execution across computers, or perhaps something about it being a data-flow driven language.<br><br>Perl isn't good at any of those. I don't know ofa nice thunking layer between Perl and Oz so maybe I'd want to just use Perl's glue-language capabilities to write Oz code and scrape the output as it came back.<br><br>I'm a rank Oz novice though.

I don't know what being a data-flow driven language buys you, fwiw. Lazy execution, sure. Whether that's something to make me want to move code into Oz or not... I have no idea why I'd do that right now.

<h2>AI::Prolog</h2>

<p>As much as I hate to say it, I'm glad you didn't go with AI::Prolog.  Scheduling problems (as with any search algorithm) are generally heavily recursive and AI::Prolog probably would have killed any hope you had of having a fast system.</p>

For what its worth, I write Oz in Emacs but don't use the integrated thing much. I do have X handy which is nice for those popups though. There's also printing stuff to STDOUT if you've no X.<br><br>A compile -&gt; run command looks like this:<br><br>ozc    -c program.oz &amp;&amp; ozengine program.ozf<br><br>A compile -&gt; debug command looks like this and it requires a GUI. The debugger mostly sucks though.<br><br>ozc -g -c program.oz &amp;&amp; ozd      program.ozf<br><br>
