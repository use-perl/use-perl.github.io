<p>With closing dates for the 2008 northern conference season coming up soon, I need to make a decision on what I do this year.<br/><br/>My ideal situation would be, if only once, to do the entire trek starting at YAPC::NA, to OSCON, and then to YAPC::EU.<br/><br/>After 5 years of blood sweat and tears with little time off, I could REALLY use a sabbatical.<br/><br/>Lacking extreme amounts of cash, but with enough to be able to cover most flights and most meals, it is feasible.<br/><br/>My goal is roughly to spend each week in a different city, heading in a generally eastwards direction from Sydney -> US -> Europe -> Sydney.<br/><br/>So if you'd like to have me come to your city (anywhere in North America or Europe should be ok, and I have potential short stops in Asia (outbound and inbound flight changes) and I could probably be lured down to the top half of South America.<br/><br/>I intend to grab a round the world ticket to cover the main legs, with domestic hops in between. I don't really mind how big these detours are, especially if you can find a Perl-friendly company happy to pick the tabs for the detour flights.<br/><br/>In exchange for a bed or a couch for the week, I'm happy to fill as many speaking engagements or hackathons in as you can schedule, and in the gaps I intend to hack on a variety of things that have been lacking attention.<br/><br/>If I can find a chance to hook up with Perl 6 people, I wouldn't mind taking a stab at some Parrot/Perl6 toolchain stuff or a Perl 6 Win32 distribution as well.<br/><br/>I've got around a week or so to finalize a list of cities that I can take to my travel agent and see if we can work this whole thing out, so feel free to spam your monger lists and see if they are interested.<br/><br/>So, can I stay at your place?<br/><br/></p>
