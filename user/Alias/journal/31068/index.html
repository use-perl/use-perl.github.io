<p>It seems to be the season for moving.<br/><br/>After much effort in my home town and share housing in Sydney trying to get my consulting business up and running, I'm happy to add that I've finally moved into a my "proper" startup apartment, which I found at the last minute in a stroke of luck.<br/><br/>It's at the top of my price range, but looks like it's much more, so I'm very happy.<br/><br/>Amoungst it's many fine features, it's close to transport, I have room to take visitors if anyone happens to be coming through Sydney, it's fully client-compatible, is "work here one day a week and the rest at home" staff compatible, and has the amazing (to me) property of being one of a small number of leased apartments in a building with is otherwise 5 star serviced apartments (complete with pools, rooftop tennis, spa, sauna, snooker and the works).<br/><br/>Which means that although I'm paying for an ordinary apartment, it feels like I'm living in a hotel. :)<br/><br/>Of course, given the unusual nature of my (self) employment, they wanted 4 months rent in advance, but both to get into this place and not be homeless, I'm more than happy to do so and shell out the big wad'o'cash to cover the rent till christmas.<br/><br/>So my bank account looks a lot smaller today, and is about to get smaller still, as next I have to fill the place with furnture and appliances, since I don't current own any of that. :(<br/><br/>But consider this an open invitation to visit and stay if you happen to be in Sydney. Because I finally have somewhere to live where it's actually SAFE to make such an offer.</p>
