<p>One of the best, and slightly surreal, things you start encountering when you take <a href="http://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=6&url=http%3A%2F%2Fyapc.tv%2F2008%2Fye%2Flt%2Flt2-14-alias-trailer%2F&ei=aJK7SukczZ6RBcGWxZsN&usg=AFQjCNGOD8onH8PDagsuu8_9QFFi6_9rrg">Trailer Theory</a> into your heart is the great B-grade movie.<br/><br/>In fact, the original seed of the idea was born with such an event.<br/><br/>One night a few years after I left University I got an SMS from a good friend saying "We're all seeing a movie tonight, be at $cinema at 7pm, I'll grab your ticket".<br/><br/>So of course, I dutifully headed in to town and met up with everybody, and was given my ticket to some movie called The Others. Due to a rollicking conversation on some topic I can't remember, I forgot to ask what it was about.<br/><br/>And so as a result I walked in knowing not only what it was about, but I didn't even know what genre it was.<br/><br/>It turned out to be fairly ordinary B-grade ghost mystery/twist type thing, but since I was trying to work out what TYPE of movie it was while it was already underway, it was quite an intellectual thrill ride for most of the time.<br/><br/>I had another of those rare moments again this week when I was going through random movies on the sekrit "deniable" file server and discovered a movie from 2008 that was so B-grade that it never even got a cinematic release in Australia. It was originally MEANT to be a full cost movie, but some dramas during the funding process meant it failed to secure enough money and got made on the cheap (but not so cheap as to be schlocky).<br/><br/>Despite a rotten tomatoes score of only 38% it turns out the movie is another one of these rare birds that are made into an entirely different experience when you have no idea what the hell is going on. And I can't even really give you any clues without spoiling the fun.<br/><br/>So with a reminder to avoid learning ANYTHING whatsoever about the story, the premise, or even seeing the poster for it if you know nothing already, I highly recommend "Outlander". <br/><br/>Oddly, so far as I can tell, the only real way to watch this with absolutely no pre-information is either torrent it by name alone, or have friends/partner/family get it for you and do active information hiding.<br/><br/>Regardless, I recommend the movie. Watch it blind and confused, then consider how much less you'd have enjoyed it if you knew anything about it.<br/><br/>Oh, and if you can organise it, the movie will benefit from a projector or some other large format tv screen, plus a good sound system (with lots of dynamic range if possible).</p>

<h2>Matrix and Children of Men.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vhold/">vhold</a> on 2009-09-24T20:00:02</h3>
I saw both of these movies this way and they were definitely both the best movie going experiences I ever had.<br/><br/>I'm not really sure how I managed to pull off not knowing what the Matrix was about, but Children of Men had kind of come out of nowhere into a limited theater run and I saw it on New Years Eve in a packed auditorium.  That was the most breathless crowd I'd ever been in, the tension was almost unbearably thick, everybody sort of had a "I just got off a roller coaster" look of relief at the end.
