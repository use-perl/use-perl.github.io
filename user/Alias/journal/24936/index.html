<p>Recently I jumped on eBay for the first serious time ever to see if I could find a copy of Total Annihilation.<br/><br/><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=11053&item=8193585921&rd=1&ssPageName=WDVW><br">http://cgi.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=11053&item=8193585921&rd=1&ssPageName=WDVW><br</a><br/>Yes, the going price for a copy today is $120+ dollars.<br/><br/>With the first expansion pack (designed to 'complete and balance' the multiplayer game) Total Annihilation became in my opinion the greatest multiplayer game ever.<br/><br/>For a player that could handle the complexity it was just incredibly to play against another human player.<br/><br/>120 different unit types, simultaneous ground, air, sea, underwater, artillery and nuclear battles in parallel (all of which you can individually near-stalemate and none-of which you could neglect). True information warfare with radar and jamming bots competing to enhance and limit your over the horizon radar-only targetting of the larger weapons.<br/><br/>Games that lasted 4-8 hours and required true innovation to break through for a victory. <br/><br/>NO RESOURCE LIMITS!!! You could build unlimited nuclear reactors (optionally stealthed) and then energy-matter converters, leading to unlimited scalability.<br/><br/>HUGE maps, that were something like 100-200 screens wide and which even exceeded the enormous max range of nuclear missiles.<br/><br/>This game is now 8 years old. So on a modern computers, you can run at 1280xwhatever resolution, and a small patch increases the unit limit to 5000 units. Yes, e-frigging-normous armies. And they STILL don't provide any avenues to just roll over the enemy. (Did I mention long range gattling artilery cannons)<br/><br/>In such situations, one tends to resort to saturation nukes (mass strikes from 30-50 nuclear silos can sometimes do the job, but the nuke shields bunkers and mobile-units can punch out 5-6 defensive anti-missile-missiles for each offensive missile) or mass air strikes using stealth fighter-bombers (which are still somewhat easy prey for anti-aircraft).<br/><br/>But the true sign of it being the greatest game ever is that today, 8 years after release, it STILL looks gorgeous to play, and the price on eBay is HIGHER than the original shelf price.<br/><br/></p>

Reminds me of the <a href="http://www.cannis.net/cannisrules/" title="cannis.net">Cannis Rules</a cannis.net> mod to Red Alert/Yuri's Revenge we play at work at least a couple of times a week.<br> <br>Excellent gameplay and *lots* of ways to combine different features of the game.
