<p><a href="http://strawberryperl.com/download/strawberry-perl-5.10.0-update-1-beta-2.exe">http://strawberryperl.com/download/strawberry-perl-5.10.0-update-1-beta-2.exe (17.8Mb)</a><br/><br/><a href="http://strawberryperl.com/download/strawberry-perl-5.10.0-update-1-beta-2.zip">http://strawberryperl.com/download/strawberry-perl-5.10.0-update-1-beta-2.zip (36.7Mb)</a><br/><br/>This is the second beta of the upcoming Strawberry Perl April 2008 release.<br/><br/>This release adds the installation of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Win32::Env::Path">Win32::Env::Path</a> (to clean paths, although this isn't integrated into the installer yet) as well as a few more incremental module updates.<br/><br/>It is also the first release where <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perl::Dist">Perl::Dist</a> can simultaneously generate both an .exe and .zip for a distribution in a single build pass (the later being an installer-free base setup that people can use for easier experimentation).<br/><br/>And yes, those libraries really are the same thing, despite the size difference. The .zip uses regular deflate while the .exe uses the far superior LZMA compression at maximum settings provided by Inno Setup.<br/><br/>Inno Setup has been incremented to 5.2.3 for this release, which fixes a few niggly issues and adds a workaround for some permissions problems on Vista. Please note this release will not be fully Vista-compatible (you still cannot compile XS-based modules) but the installer should be a bit less problematic in some cases.<br/><br/>Updated Vista-friendly win32api and related MinGW packages that are compatible with Perl 5.10.0 are not available at this time, but I'm hopefully they turn up by next release, allowing for Vista support.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I've also had to remove one eagerly anticipated feature. The ppm client will no longer be available in the upcoming release.<br/><br/>While <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?XML::Parser">XML::Parser</a> and other dependencies now build correctly, the SOAP::Lite dependency does not work. The test suite explodes under Win32 for reasons related to sockets and POSIX, so this isn't something I can just skip over.<br/><br/>As an alternative, I have added <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?PAR::Dist::InstallPPD">PAR::Dist::InstallPPD</a> as a secondary method for accessing PPM modules.<br/><br/>I hope to do one more test release before the final version, with a working PATH-clean-on-uninstall implemented.<br/><br/>In related news, Perl::Dist POD coverage is up markedly, and I'm on target for a proper fully documented Perl::Dist at the same time as the Strawberry release.</p>

<h2>PPM and SOAP::Lite</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rkobes/">rkobes</a> on 2008-03-26T04:53:12</h3>
That's unfortunate about PPM not being available due to the failure of SOAP::Lite - SOAP::Lite is only used within PPM.pm for soap-based repositories, which, as of ActivePerl 819, have been replaced by   summary-file-based repositories. Thus, the dependency on SOAP::Lite could be removed for perl-5.10. I'll submit a patch to that effect.

I'm not easily able to build patched modules at the present time in Perl::Dist.<br><br>Could you instead roll an "unauthorised" PPM.pm release with a dev version number lower than the current official release (0.01_01 or something would be fine).<br><br>That way I can just build it from there.<br><br>
