<p>I've uploaded <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Install">Module::Install</a> 0.57 to CPAN. This is the first release where I've moved beyond documentation and started to make some code changes.<br/><br/>This release is primarily a stability and compatibility release, and resolves 5-10 rt.cpan.org bugs, including pretty much all remaining trivial bugs.<br/><br/>* Should <b>finally</b> stop <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN">CPAN.pm</a> installs using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPANPLUS">CPANPLUS</a> when recursing. Before the existing recursion rules, I've forced Module::Install to <b>always</b> hand off to the same installer it is being run under if possible. So if you have CPAN.pm 1.83 should always handle recursion now.<br/><br/>* The install_script command for installing scripts to the system has been documented.<br/><br/>* Adds requires_external_cc for people that absolutely need a C compiler, or the install should abort. In future releases this is going to be called automatically for you in certain circumstances.<br/><br/>* All of the compiler-related commands have been renamed and moved under <i>cc_foo</i>, as they were confusing for many people. For example <i>inc_paths</i> refered to C compiler INC, not Perl inc. It is now <i>cc_inc_paths</i>. <i>c_files</i> can also contains .xs files, so is now <i>cc_files</i>. The few authors with compiling Module::Install distributions will need to update their Makefile.PL installers.<br/><br/>I tried to document the compiler commands, but unfortunately they have only been implemented in a fairly simplistic way, and aren't really flexible enough for general use.<br/><br/>So for the next release, I'm hoping to start refactoring Module::Install::Compiler to make it a bit more modular and far less insane. <br/><br/><b>Anyone that has a XS-based module and is interested in Module::Install, please contact me.</b><br/><br/>And with a bit of luck we might also start seeing a few more unit tests and the beginning of some movement towards VMS support.</p>
