<p>My current work (we sell office supplies) is evaluating options for a replacement for their core ERP system that handles over a billion dollars in orders a year.<br/><br/>After a long competition, we're down to SAP and Microsoft as the final two contenders.<br/><br/>The SAP guys gave a talk for the general tech-heads at the company on what the current generation of SAP stuff does.<br/><br/>One of the more interesting parts of the talk was regarding the SAP core systems (general ledger, etc etc). It's been around for a few years now (most of the new shiny features are around the services and apps outside the core) and SAP's next release of their core systems is due in 2013.<br/><br/>The takeaway comment from the SAP expert giving the talk (and he was not at all a sales droid, showing actual clue) was that businesses (especially management) doesn't like upgrading.<br/><br/>SAP surveys of their client base suggest the ideal/desired upgrade path (patch-levels aside) for "stable" business types is...<br/><br/><i>"We want to upgrade once every 8-12 years, on a Saturday afternoon"</i>

I suggest you speak to victims of SAP, and you'll find they utterly regret installing SAP.<br>The Other Name won't pass my kbd's lips...<br>

Well, since we are a Windows(desktop)/Linux(server) shop, if they go with the Microsoft solution half the infrastructure team will quit.<br><br>Microsoft are certainly cheaper though.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>The reason the others got knocked out of the race is simply that their offerings weren't integrated enough.<br><br>The final 4 were SAP, Microsoft, Oracle and another company that has bought a number of other smaller ERP vendors.<br><br>Both Oracle and the other guys were culled on the basis that their stuff was all disparate systems bundled together, they didn't have the level of integration that we needed.<br>
