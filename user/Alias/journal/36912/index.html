<p>Every now and then on the CPAN we get some variety of weird, unusual, destructive, or simply batshit insane insane authors.<br/><br/>Typically they upload one, or two, or 10, or maybe even 20 modules of dubious value, and then most of the time they burn out after 6 months or so and dissappear.<br/><br/>Every time this happens, discussion will circulate pondering why we don't crack down on people, or restrict uploads or something of that nature.<br/><br/>This talk by Clay Shirky provides what I think is the best and most elequent explaination I've seen yet of why CPAN continues to maintain such low barriers.<br/><br/><a href="http://xrl.us/kkwmp">http://xrl.us/kkwmp</a><br/><br/>Of course, full credit for maintaining this policy for the CPAN goes to Andreas, who understood this long before the rest of us, and continues to hold firm in his position.<br/><br/></p>

<h2>Good talk, but we're not there yet</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sjn/">sjn</a> on 2008-07-15T11:17:04</h3>
<p>I think the 80/20 rule he explained was the most interesting bit. He says that 80% of all contributors give just a little tiny contribution, totalling to 20% of all contributions combined.

</p><p>What he doesn't touch upon is the fact that these 80% also constitute 80% of the "recruitment base" of a project.</p><p>These 80% have recognized a project and invested enough time to give some kind of contribution - a bug report, a comment in an IRC channel, a documentation improvement, a recommendation or a patch. Their contribution may not have been big, but (as Clay Shirky hints) it may have been a important one. In any case, the contribution tells us about the commitment (potential or actual) from that person.</p><p>How can we make use of this potential? E.g. is there a clear, easily available and understandable path to follow for these 80%, so that it becomes more likely some of them "move up the graph" and contribute more?</p><p>I think this "escalating contributions path" could be better and more visible, if it at all exists.</p><p>Sure, props to Andreas, but there's still a long way to go, IMO.</p>



<h2>Unfettered</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2008-07-15T15:08:38</h3>
CPAN and open source thrive because of the unfettered distribution of shit, not in spite of it.



<h2>Yay</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2008-07-17T14:44:54</h3>
<p>I started reading your post and I was hoping your answer would be "it is better that way," and it was.  Woo.</p>
