<p>Careful planning. It's useful whether you are building large systems, or whether you are moving house.<br/><br/>I need to move house today. And with a little planning I've established that my local (regional twin-prop) airline only charges $2 for oversized luggage, and has no limit on the quantity as long as there the plane stays within weight limits.<br/><br/>I've been fairly careful over the last 3 years here not to accumulate any possessions that are either very large or very heavy. And I'm moving at the weekly low point for passenger numbers.<br/><br/>So I have my office and most of my life (including, shortly after this point, my main computers) packed up as around 120 kilos of luggage, and for about $250 (including taxi fare from the airport) I can move house to a different city 800km away in about 3 hours from door to door. :)<br/><br/>Farewell Lismore, Sydney awaits!</p>

Have you factored in the huge tip you'll have to give the taxi drive to load 120kg into his cab?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
(How are you going to carry that much on both endpoints of the trip?)

Tip? What's a tip? We don't do those here, I think the preference is to just pay people relatively decently.<br><br>It turned out to be about 97 kilograms, which was a bit tricky to fit only a single trolley to get out to the taxis, but the taxi attendant removed the barriers to let me through, and then pulled aside a station wagon taxi, which fit everything in OK.<br><br>And of course, at both the entry and exit points, the meter stays running while loading and unloading. So it all went incredibly smoothly.<br><br>And I gave the guy a 10 buck tip (highly unusual by local standards) anyway.

<h2>Overweight luggage</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/roger.hale/">roger.hale</a> on 2006-05-17T03:54:48</h3>
Could this trigger a change in the airline's luggage policies?<br/><br/>(Now if you were moving the <b>whole house</b> this way, I bet they'd charge a little more!)

I doubt it.<br><br>It's $2 a kilo... if the plane will take it.<br><br>If you bring more than they can handle, they just bump the excess until the next flight.<br><br>For this flight, a 100 kilogram self-propelled meatbag can ride the plane for $120. 100 kilograms of dead weight costs $200. (of course, they have to carry it though...)<br><br>So I guess you could keep dumping it and they'd keep taking it.<br><br>Of course, once the value of a possession falls very close to $2 a kilogram, or is too large to fit into the hold, land becomes cheaper. And if you wanted to move a couple of tons, it's MUCH cheaper<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Ah -- $2 a kilo.  That makes sense, and scales well.  I read it as a $2 flat fee, which sounded quite a miracle, and I wondered how they could possibly sustain it.
