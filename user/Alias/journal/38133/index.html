<p>Although I still hope not to try to package up my release automation as a CPAN modules (like maybe ten other authors) because I don't think it's appropriate for others to use, I am beginning to think it might be worth reformulating my new repository modelling code.<br/><br/>Making the switch from trying to automate processes to building a complete "Repository Model" and treating the repository software as being subservient to the Perl code has been a massive win.<br/><br/>I continue to be amazed by the speed at which I can add new functionality, once I'd dropped the "crown jewels" apprach and stopped thinking of the repository as being somehow special.<br/><br/>In about an hour or two, I've been able to add enough code to automate the process of reviewing external contributions to my modules.<br/><br/>With one line of code using only the repository model, I can take the current trunk for a distribution, find the last (stable or dev) release tarball, export the trunk from that point in time out to a temp directory, and then spawn a diff/comparison tool (in my case, Araxis Merge) to see what (if anything) has changed on the trunk.<br/><br/>The next step is to add support for PPI-based normalised diffing, where instead of doing a naive diff, I just create a Perl::Signature hash for each Perl file in the distribution and compare them to see if there's any non-documentation changes sitting in trunk pending release.<br/><br/>And because it's all done in the model, I should also be able to just run this across every distribution in the repository, and build a report of which modules need releases.<br/><br/>This should help to further reduce the effort needed to look after very high numbers of distributions, and increase the amount of time I spend doing the actual critical jobs of reviewing the actual changes and being "the decider", rather than stuffing around with actually doing stuff.<br/><br/>The next step after that is to add support for prioritisation, to start to answer questions like "What are the modules have changes that need to be released <b>AND</B> pass all tests <b>AND</b> have a correctly updated $VERSION and updated Changes file".<br/><br/>Which is to say, to allow me to prioritise helping the contributors that have helped me the most by doing the most prep work, because at the moment I am definitely finding I have trouble tracking everything.<br/><br/>Once all this works, I'll start looking at whether it's worth packaging it up. The main issue is that it requires your repository be svn, have a specific structure, and that you store your release files in the repository.<br/><br/>We'll see...</p>

This sounds incredibly sexy. I can't wait to see it.
