<p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/smpeters/">Steve Peters</a> has been concentrating his very limited time on the Perl core lately, and hasn't had the time deal with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Archive::Zip">Archive::Zip</a> for about a year.<br/><br/>A couple of dozen bugs have built up and not gotten fixed, one of which is causing some problems for Vanilla Perl.<br/><br/>So Steve has assigned me co-maint permissions for it, and Archive::Zip has moved into my <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Alias/journal/29327">collaborative svn repository</a>.<br/><br/>While I only need to fix my particular itch, now anyone who has an account can fix their problem directly if they want, and I'll press the release button and upload the new version.<br/><br/>If you have an Archive::Zip itch to fix, ping me to have your CPAN id enabled.</p>

<h2>Orphanage?</h2>

I wouldn't call it an orphanage.  More a conservatory -- we want these modules to be tended and grow, right?

Absolutely.<br><br>But apart from the ones of mine, anything else that's going to be moving into my SVN will be there because nobody has time to look after it properly for the moment.<br><br>So it gives it somewhere for lose children that still need care to stay and be looked after by an order of monks, until we can find the module a real foster home with somebody that cares enough about the module to take full time responsibility for it.<br><br>I'm hoping at some point someone that does care a lot about Zip files will put up their hand and offer to take it over and drive the bug count to zero, and keep it there.<br><br>
