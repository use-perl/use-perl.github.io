<p>A few times now, I've heard the oldbies and greybeards quote "Fun is not banging your head against a wall".<br/><br/>The phrase came to mind today, when I was dreading working on TinyAuth, my repository manager, because I really really hate <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Apache::Htpasswd">Apache::Htpasswd</a>, but I really don't want to write a replacement. I really honestly do try to treat rewriting modules as a last resort, I swear! (::Tiny modules notwithstanding)<br/><br/>Taking another look through CPAN on the train I noticed <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Authen::Htpasswd">Authen::Htpasswd</a>, which I somehow missed when I was looking on search.cpan.org.<br/><br/>Apart from the fact the tests break on Win32 (which I'll be fixing shortly) it's a MUCH nicer module, does what I want, looks more like Perl, and appears well implemented (apart from the broken on Windows thing).<br/><br/>So I replaced the current code with it in about 3 minutes between Artamon and Chatswood stations, and now all of a sudden I'm excited about continuing TinyAuth development again.<br/><br/>But this isn't fun, although I'd be tempted to compare them.<br/><br/>No, I think this is RELIEF.<br/><br/>Fun would need to be something that even people that had never tried to use any .htpasswd modules before would experience.<br/><br/>Relief is only experienced by the people that have been banging their heads against the wall.</p>

I agree that Apache::Htpasswd is a less-than-ideal module.  I <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=14973" title="cpan.org">exchanged messages</a cpan.org> with the author and was not really satisfied with his solution to a security hole.  Apparently <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/dist/Apache-Htpasswd" title="perl.org">Smylers agrees with us</a perl.org>



<h2>the fun is anticipating the relief</h2>

I once told some teachers that a 'game' was something that you could not adequately define. There is only a family resemblance between all the things we can call a game, and no way of describing that resemblance in words. Fun is not even a characteristic distinguishing what is a game from what isn't.<br><br>I gave the example of football, which is a game, but not fun.<br><br>One teacher said, it's fun if you win.<br><br>So the motto is, No under the gun, no fun. I can't think of a good word to rhyme with anticipation.
