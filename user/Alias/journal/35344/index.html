<h1>Parse::CPAN::Meta 0.02 - YAML support in the Perl core</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>In order to complete phase 1 of the CPAN toolchain auto-upgrade work (which consists of changes to about 5-6 toolchain modules to support configure_requires:) we need the ability to parse META.yml to be available in the Perl core (so that we can guarantee auto-upgrade is working on a default install).<br/><br/>YAML::Tiny is the obvious choice for this, since the other options are a) Very large b) Require third-party C libraries.<br/><br/>But there's been a long-standing concern from the YAML faction (camp? clique? posse?) about YAML::Tiny not being a "real" YAML parser, and their concerns that if something is in the core with a "YAML" label on it, people will preferentially use it instead of a real YAML parser.<br/><br/>The compromise position that everyone seems happy with is to put YAML::Tiny (or enough of it to support parsing META.yml) into the core, but not to CALL it YAML, and to hide the package in a namespace that won't tempt people into using it outside of it's intended scope.<br/><br/>So I've create <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Parse::CPAN::Meta">Parse::CPAN::Meta</a>, which was built in the following manner.<br/><br/>1. Copy YAML::Tiny to Parse::CPAN::Meta and rename the namespaces.<br/><br/>2. Remove the YAML-writing half of the code, and just keep the parser.<br/><br/>3. Remove object-orientation, and just keep the Load and LoadFile functions.<br/><br/>4. Remove the global $errstr variable (to avoid potential threading issues) and return all errors via exceptions.<br/><br/>5. Remove YAML-comparison testing, YAML::Syck-comparison testing and round-trip testing from the test suite, but otherwise keep all the same test, sample files and regression tests.<br/><br/>6. Rewrite the documentation to reflect the new purpose of the code.<br/><br/>Somewhat ironically, this means that Parse::CPAN::Meta is significantly "tinier" and probably also faster than YAML::Tiny (but at the loss of the ability to write YAML, which I consider essential for a minimalist YAML implementation).<br/><br/>My intention is that this module becomes dual-lifed from birth, so that it can synchronize with any improvements or bug fixes in YAML::Tiny.<br/><br/>Any feedback is welcome.</p>

<p>The name change alleviates my main concern, for whatever that's worth.</p>



<h2>mostly parsing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gizmo_mathboy/">gizmo_mathboy</a> on 2008-01-10T05:01:31</h3>
is what I use YAML for, this sounds like a great module for about 90% of my yaml needs.<br><br>I'm converting any config files I need to being yaml, it's just one less thing I have to write (config file parser) and I'm liking it.



<h2>Interesting..</h2>

<p>I will have to look into to simplifying the dependency chain of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-YAML-Meta/lib/Test/YAML/Meta.pm" title="cpan.org">Test-YAML-Meta</a cpan.org>.</p>

<p>In fact following your naming, it may be appropriate to change the name of my distribution to Test-CPAN-Meta.</p>

<h2>Not enough!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/srezic/">srezic</a> on 2008-01-10T13:32:22</h3>
I am still not satisfied. For me the namespace was never a problem, as it reminded me of another markup language with a tiny counterpart, namely SVG and SVG-Tiny. And as "-" is not a valid character for a module name I found it quite natually that it is replaced by "::".
<p>
What bothers me more is that I don't know what is YAML::Tiny supposed to parse. It is not yet specified. I think there should be a written spec first.
</p><p>
And then further problems: the META.yml specification clearly says that META.yml should be written in the YAML format. This means one can easily create correct meaningful META.yml which cannot be parsed by YAML::Tiny, see the still unanswered <a href="https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=31263" title="cpan.org">RT ticket</a cpan.org>. This is just one problem, others are probably there.
</p><p>
So what to do? We could change the META.yml specification and explicitely allow only the YAML-Tiny format (which needs to be specified, see above). I think this would not be the worst move. The full YAML spec is really huge and it is probably unnecessary to support all of the spec in this case.
</p><p>
Or we can just put the whole of YAML::Syck or YAML into the perl core. After all, it is not that huge (maybe 1% of the current size of the perl core), and having YAML in the core would not be too bad. I don't consider having the syck library in the core to be a problem, unless there are some licensing issues.</p>

<p>Writing a spec for the format supported by YAML::Tiny seems like a sound idea, actually. Restricting <code>META.yml</code> to that subset of YAML, once written, sounds like a better choice to me than putting libsyck in the core. Dual-life modules are &#8220;interesting&#8221; enough without throwing XS into the mix.</p>

There is a LOT more resistance to having significant third-party C libraries in the core, compared to what I've done.<br><br>As for a YAML-Tiny spec, I'll try to knock something up.<br>
