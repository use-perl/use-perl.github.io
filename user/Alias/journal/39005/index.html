<p>Skud mentioned this in her blog.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.dreamwidth.org/">DreamWidth</a> is a reboot of LiveJournal with what looks like an awesome (and far more diverse than usual) community.<br/><br/>The only downside is that use.perl.org has never been tagged as a "social networking" site in my corporate nanny filter, and DreamWidth is.<br/><br/>I wonder if the DW guys could spin up a "blog.perl.org" domain...

I would SO head to DreamWidth to do my Perl stuff if I could afford it (which I can't) or if an invite code fell into my hands.

<p>Well, few things I would like to mention here<br>First 25$ a year is not much (The premium account is 40$ a a year but the difference is not that big anyway, so you may save the extra 15$)</p><p>And apparently Dreamwidth seems to be trying to create or attract a community of serious bloggers who are willing to pay for their services.</p><p>So anyway, if you are serious about blogging 25$ doesn't seem that much. And its what will keep them floating!</p><p>Although thinking about a bit more, if you are a serious blogger, you should probably host your own blog to make money by allowing Google to post Ads to your site</p><p>But again 25$ isn't much if you liked what Dreamwidth is offering</p>

Also worth noting that you don't have to keep paying to keep your account.  You can pay as little as $3 for one month, then when it expires, you revert to free account status -- you can still use it, but you have fewer icon slots and other features like that.  It's perfectly usable in that state, but they limit some of the cost-intensive things you can do.  Or you can sign up with an invite code.  I have a handful of codes and can get more.

<p>Unfortunately, when your annual income is something like USD $50.00 - $200.00 (no K in there) a year... (and 10% of that is paid as tithing) free stuff/stuff you only pay for once is more of a neccessity.</p><p>I like what DreamWidth is doing, and I'll pay for them if I get any money at all, but I just do not have it right now. (I have GOT to start looking for some telecommute work after my family's garage sale is done this weekend.)</p>

Fair enough -- though I suspect that most people who use use.perl.org or would like an LJ are not in that situation.

<p>I was looking at it for another reason as well. Help in being a better Perl programmer as they do mentoring for volunteers. I haven't dropped into their IRC room to check it out as of yet.</p>
