<p>Google has freaking ridiculous amounts of bandwidth and in some cases dedicated fibre. So when it comes to downloads from a single point, if they can't handle it, well nobody can I guess.<br/><br/>Google's Project Hosting downloads also allow for single-click downloads, and have download counters. So that would seem to fulfill most of the criteria.<br/><br/>The only downside is the 100MB file size limit, but I can deal with that for now by delivering the two primary installers from there, and continue to serve the more specialized distros (Vanilla and the .zip versions) directly from strawberryperl.com at DreamHost.<br/><br/>So if you live outside of the US/Canada, could you please try downloading the following and let me know the download speed you are seeing.<br/><br/><a href="http://vanilla-perl.googlecode.com/files/strawberry-perl-5.10.0.1-1.exe">http://vanilla-perl.googlecode.com/files/strawberry-perl-5.10.0.1-1.exe</a><br/><br/>If this isn't good enough, then my next target is the Coral Cache network, and from there it's probably a custom geo-based mirror network... ugh.</p>

<h2>Not bad, not that great</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ishigaki/">ishigaki</a> on 2008-05-08T03:56:53</h3>
around 300 KB/s from google, around 470 KB/s from strawberryperl.com. (downloaded from Japan, ADSL 47M).



<h2>Looks pretty good to me</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grantm/">grantm</a> on 2008-05-08T05:30:23</h3>
Nearly 400KB/s to NZ.  This was a test from the office.  It would be much slower from home on account of crappy DSL.



<h2>Belgium, 10 points...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2008-05-08T05:57:47</h3>
From Google, the download got completed in 43 seconds, average 415kB/sec.  Or so it says... I think that ignores the time while the browser was waiting for me to state what to do with the file, while in the meantime, it has already downloaded part of the file in the background. Because, while it was downloading, the progress indicator started out at 343kB/sec, and the speed slowly increased to 400kB/sec towards the end. Nowhere have I seen it reach that "average speed"...

<p>Anyway: if <em>this</em> is not good enough, nothing is.</p>



<h2>And the votes of the danish jury...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/htoug/">htoug</a> on 2008-05-08T06:13:51</h3>
I see 329.69K/s on a more than 200MBit/sec (I don't know much, but it's a BIG pipe) at our hosting facility, and 209.06K/s on our slow 8Mbit/sec in the office.



<h2>UK</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/acme/">acme</a> on 2008-05-08T07:18:24</h3>
1.63M/s from my ADSL2+ London.



<h2>UK - nice and fast</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/fireartist/">fireartist</a> on 2008-05-08T08:30:45</h3>
Using wget, I got it in 6 seconds (3.06 MB/s) from googlecode.<br><br>The same file from vanillaperl.com took 40 seconds (451.79 KB/s)<br>



<h2>btw - multiple projects?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/fireartist/">fireartist</a> on 2008-05-08T08:33:57</h3>
You might get away with creating separate projects for each of vanilla / strawberry / chocolate, and get a 100MB limit for each

<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2008-05-08T09:04:14</h3>
Yeah, maybe. It probably still wouldn't be enough though...<br><br>Once you bundle in Wx+GTK and image libs and what not, Chocolate is looking pretty big.<br>

<h2>Italy</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mir/">mir</a> on 2008-05-08T08:42:44</h3>
Basically as fast as my (very slow!) DSL connection could get it. Started at 70 KB/s and when my wife was done watching sky lanterns on YouTube it jumped up to 130 KB/s, which is the fastest I ever get.



<h2>This looks like a winner to me</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2008-05-08T09:08:12</h3>
On the basis of the above, I think the googlecode solution is looking like the best solution, at least in the short term until chocolate arrives.<br><br>I'll chuck both<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.exe installers up on there, and leave the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.zip ones on the strawberry website.



<h2>Data points from Germany</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2008-05-08T10:40:32</h3>
<p>Over DSL then wireless, 540 kb/sec on average, But note that wget includes the latency for initiating the connection in the download time; speed varied a little, but hit my 800ish kb/sec maximum several times. From my web host shell, I got 630 kb/sec, which is middling. At the Uni data centre it did 380 kb/sec, which is somewhat lacklustre, though it&#8217;s hard to know what this means as speeds there tend to span over an order of magnitude.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/hex/">hex</a> on 2008-05-08T14:57:25</h3>
From my keyweb.de hosting account I got 2.25 MB/s. Which isn't bad at all.

<h2>Ireland &amp;amp;&amp;amp; UK</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/link/">link</a> on 2008-05-08T10:56:20</h3>
I get 150KB/s at work (sucky internet) and 440KB/s on university server. Both in Ireland. Rented server in the UK does 2MB/s. The same server gets 2.17 MB/s from strawberryperl.com.



<h2>NL</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cyclist38/">cyclist38</a> on 2008-05-08T12:07:08</h3>
I got a solid 335KB/s on my home ADSL in the far northern Netherlands.
