<h1>Do you need to upgrade your Module::Install?</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>In the great <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Install">Module::Install</a> vs <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Build">Module::Build</a> "paradigm war", one of the more notable scenarios is when a major problem is discovered.<br/><br/>In the Module::Install model, all authors need to do incremental releases of the modules affected by the problem, but users need to do nothing.<br/><br/>In the Module::Build model, all users affected by the problem need to upgrade their version of Module::Build, but authors need to do nothing.<br/><br/>At present, both of these don't solve this problem correctly.<br/><br/>Module::Install doesn't have a method for ensuring authors upgrade, and Module::Build doesn't have a method for ensuring users upgrade.<br/><br/>To start fixing this for Module::Install, I've been announcing Module::Install updates in this journal, with notes on if and when authors need to do upgrades or incremental releases.<br/><br/>With Module::Install going through a moderately sane and non-flakey period at the moment Steffen Mueller has taken the next step, and has written a script to scan all of CPAN and work out which distributions have old/bad versions of Module::Install, and need to be upgraded.<br/><br/>From Steffen:
<blockquote>There are three common toolkits for installing CPAN distributions on a
computer. The venerable ExtUtils::MakeMaker, the newer Module::Build and
Module::Install. Module::Install is different from the aforementioned
alternatives in that it is included in the distribution and hence does not
require an installation on the client machine.<br/><br/>This has the benefit of usually being simpler to set up than a distribution
using Module::Build (in case Module::Build has not been installed yet).
If the distributions using Module::Install do not use a reasonably current
version of Module::Install, however, they might be hard or impossible to
install on systems that are not supported by the old included version of
Module::Install.<br/><br/>An incompatibility between ActivePerl 5.8.8 build 817 for Win32 and older
versions of Module::Install has caused me some headache recently:
Distributions using old versions would not install at all and running the
included "Makefile.PL" would result in a cryptic error message.<br/><br/>Therefore, it is important to keep the included versions of Module::Install
reasonably up-to-date. I have generated a list of CPAN distributions that
include Module::Install and listed them with the corresponding versions. If
you are a CPAN author and have any such distributions, please consider
upgrading. Thank you.<br/><br/>You can find the list at <URL:http://steffen-mueller.net/mi_old.html>
</blockquote>
Just note that M:I version 0.61 IS considered ok, while on that list it is currently assigned to the "old" rating. This will be fixed shortly.</p>

Sorry for the error. One would think that after a couple of years as a programmer avoiding floating point comparison posed no problem.

<p>I don't have a distribution with a custom <code>Module::Build</code> subclass where the <code>build_requires</code> trick won't work, but if the <code>use</code> line doesn't, how about printing the same error message?  M::B and CPAN.pm communicate <em>somehow</em>, so I see no reason why following that protocol won't make this scheme work.</p>

The continuing problem is that error messages are of no real use.<br><br>There's a fairly good chance that the user will never see it, being buried deep in a larger installation.<br><br>Any solution which involves wetware (the user having to think) is no solution at all.<br><br>"M::B and CPAN.pm communicate somehow, so I see no reason why following that protocol won't make this scheme work."<br><br>As I said, Module::Build hasn't solved this problem yet.<br><br>The solution, as I've mentioned before, requires CPAN clients to have the capability to force-upgrade certain toolchain modules to the most current version when they detect a change.<br><br>Otherwise we are back to painful reality of circular dependencies. If Module::Build has a major problem, and someone tries to install a module that uses it, then installation fails. Period.<br><br>That they have to try and work out why it failed from the huge installer output, then work out what the hell this "Module::Build" thing is, then upgrade it seperately, then rerun the installer again, is a case of the user working around a broken installation concept.<br><br>When Module::Build fixes this by implementing a back-compatibility strategy that doesn't involve the user being smart, this problem goes away.<br>

<p>You are not paying attention.  Let me explain very slowly.</p>

<p>CPAN.pm and CPANPLUS both <em>somehow</em> detect when a distribution has unfulfilled dependencies.  Both offer to install those dependencies.</p>

<p>Both MakeMaker and <code>Module::Build</code> <em>somehow</em> indicate unfulfilled dependencies to the installer.  I don't know if it's screenscraping or an API or whatever.  I skimmed CPAN.pm this morning, but couldn't find it in two minutes.</p>

<p>Now if there's an API or if there's a particular error message being scraped and detected and if both MM and M::B use that communication mechanism (and there's no short-circuiting logic in this conditional, so evaluate this next clause), <em>so can any other code</em>.</p>

<p>If necessary, that code can even run <em>before</em> attempting to load M::B or MM or whatever.</p>

<p>What's the problem?</p>

<p>I am suggesting that, in those cases where the installation program depends on a specific minimum version of the installer module (and in several years of maintaining a couple of dozen of publicly available modules, I can think of one case where this was necessary), the author should do precisely that.</p>

<p>There already exists a perfectly good mechanism to mark and install dependencies through both of the installer shells.  Why complicate the process?</p>

<p>I can see one potential drawback, and that is if, after resolving the dependencies, the shells do <em>not</em> re-execute the installer.</p>

<p>However, it seems to me that fixing the existing dependency resolution system in only two places is much, much less work than reimplementing a dependency resolution system in <em>every</em> module.</p>

<p>I'm still not sure I've explained myself well.</p>

<p>I mean, "Authors of distributions that rely on a specific version of the bundling module should be able to mark that dependency in such a way that the installer can detect that dependency immediately."  Whether that means adding a new entry in <em>META.yml</em> or running a little bit of code at the start of <em>Build.PL</em> or <em>Makefile.PL</em>, I don't particularly care.</p>

<p>The latter seems easiest.</p>

<p>The point is, I believe you <em>can</em> run <em>just enough</em> of the bundling program to flag an unmet dependency on the bundling module that the installer shell should go off to resolve that dependency immediately.  You don't have to continue running the program at all at that point.</p>

<p>I don't think getting this done means that <code>Module::Install</code> has to go away; I've always seen its biggest value for distributing full applications with their dependencies to users who can't, won't, or shouldn't install it themselves from the CPAN.</p>

Certainly whatever the solution is, there needs to be a clear peer-reviewed (in the sense of me, Andreas, Audrey and the other people writing installer code) specification for doing it, and it needs to be implemented before the release of 5.8.9.<br><br>Oh, and apology accepted<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>Even users only need to upgrade their M::B when they&#8217;re about to install something. And CPAN.pm could check if there is an upgrade to M::B and suggest doing it just like what it already does for updates to itself.</p>

<p>Seems much more tenable than the M::I model to me.</p>

<p>I mean, look at that list &#8211; good luck getting all 83 authors to push out 469 new releases total, just to fix their installers. And that&#8217;s now that M::I is relatively new &#8211; what will the situation look like when the CPAN is full of stable or even forgotten modules?</p>

How are the user's supposed to know to upgrade Module::Build.<br><br>Installers should always assume the user is completely clueless, or doesn't even exist because they've been replaced by a small shell script.<br><br>Yes, CPAN.pm could check and force-upgrade. I've had this conversation with Ken, and there's an RT ticket in the CPAN.pm queue that says "auto-upgrade a specific set of named modules". But it DOESN'T.<br><br>And no amount of handwaving about how other people (users or Andreas) could fix Module::Build's problem doesn't change the fact that <b>right not</b> it <b>does</b> have that problem.<br><br>Module::Install has suffered from the same problem as Module::Build in regards to having to incrementally release all those modules. It was hyped too heavily, too early and too often. Both M:I and M:B are incomplete installers with significant problems to be resolved.<br><br>As for getting modules upgraded, the same rules we have always had apply. When someone needs it, they ask the author, or they take co-maint and do a release themselves.<br><br>The number of modules existing is indeed too high.<br><br>But I don't recommend people use EITHER M:I or M:B until they reach version 1.00 and become more stable. So I continue to only recommend M:I <b>only</b> in the specific case the author will be doing regular releases.<br><br>Fortunately, M:I is trying to avoid hyping any more until the major problems have been removed and it has been tested properly.
