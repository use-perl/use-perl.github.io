<p>Yesterday, after a little over a 1 year wait between productions, I (finally) uploaded the final release of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?PPI">PPI</a> 1.200.<br/><br/>This is the second time I've made the mistake of trying to get too ambitious with a major release, at the risk of never releasing.<br/><br/>I knew the features I wanted, but I had no idea when I'd have the time to actually write them, and I felt that I couldn't release until they were done.<br/><br/>But my desire to avoid releasing also had the problem that general fixes and parsing regressions/bugs weren't going into prod, they were going into 1.200.<br/><br/>So my tardiness with the new features was also damaging the production release, and in the process hurting projects like Perl::Critic who had contributed those fixes (or the failing regression tests) and weren't getting anything back for their contribution.<br/><br/>Although, as chromatic has pointed out, that Free Software can take a long time to release, as far as I'm concerned this is a wrong approach for cases where one single author is blocking development.<br/><br/>There needs to be a line at which the slow pace becomes not a programming issue, but a management issue, and for me this line is 1 year.<br/><br/>If you (or I) have exclusive control of an Open Source project, and someone brings a fault/bug (and ideally a fix) to the attention of the maintainer, and this fault is not addressed for a year or longer, I consider the maintainer to be guilty of project mismanagement.<br/><br/>They need to either get the bug fixed, hand off the module to a new maintainer, give commit rights to the person that wants the bug fixed, or otherwise just get the hell out of the way and stop being a problem.<br/><br/>Of course, chromatic's original case of Perl 6 doesn't apply, because the Perl 6 people are quite happy for you to join up and work on Perl 6.<br/><br/>I gave about a year notice to ActiveState on the PPM build farm problems, to Andy regarding Template Toolkit's terrible treatment of Win32, and to Test::Reporter on the SMTP problems.<br/><br/>All three had people that weren't fixing problems, but weren't allowing others to fix them either.<br/><br/>And I think in all three cases, moving to a more aggressive posture (creating a better Perl Distribution in Strawberry Perl, briefly taking over Template Toolkit, and publicly and harshly reviewing Test::Reporter) has had very positive results.<br/><br/>If I'd done it immediately, things would be less good. I made a terrible mistake in the early days of getting my CPAN admin bit when I forcefully took over Email::Send, and I've regretted it ever since.<br/><br/>People deserve a chance to fix their problems. But for me, if you can't fix your problems in a year you need to either start being the solution or get the hell out of the way.<br/><br/>And so PPI 1.200 is not everything I originally wanted it to be.<br/><br/>It was simply time for me to get a stable release out there, no matter what, because I was starting to be the problem and not the solution.<br/><br/>Most of the features and much of the regression work in PPI 1.200 are the work of amazing Chris Dolan. He deserves far more credit for PPI 1.200 than I do.<br/><br/>The biggest user-visible change is the complete refactoring of the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?PPI::Token::Number">PPI::Token::Number</a> tree, which not contains separate sub-classes for each of the numeric types.<br/><br/>These also contain the beginning of the ->literal method implementation, which lets you (safely) get the actual Perl value for various tokens or trees.<br/><br/>I had wanted a fuller implementation allowing the literal'ing of nested ARRAY references and so on, but I simply didn't have time to implement it.<br/><br/>Internally, the biggest change is to move to exceptions for error handling inside the tokenizer and lexer. This removed a TON of cases like
<pre>
  $self->foo or return undef;
</pre>
In the process, simplifying these cases also allowed a number of methods to be inlined and all the extra inlining plus the removal of all those conditionals should result in a slightly faster tokenizer (before the addition of any extra code to handle regressions).<br/><br/>Speaking of regressions, PPI 1.200 contains a whole crapton of lexical improvements and regresions tests.<br/><br/>In particular, the handling of { } in various contexts is vastly improved.<br/><br/>The PPI constructor now also has time-out support, so that the parsing of large pathological documents can be aborted safely and without any DOM (and thus memory) leaks.<br/><br/>Pending any major incompatible changes, my hope from here on is to add features MUCH more gradually from here on, and a greater addition of partly implemented methods labelled as experimental, in recognition of my inability to spend vast amounts of time on PPI and push large features through.<br/><br/>Again, my apologies for the delay, and please enjoy the new release.</p>
