<p>Over the last couple of days, I've been doing quite a bit of hacking on Padre.<br/><br/>Apart from fixing random things that annoy me and rearranging menus, I've been concentrating most of my time on the new Padre::Document classes and using the document model to start on PPI integration.<br/><br/>The result is a bit (ok, very) rough at the moment, but I'm starting to land the first interesting features.<br/><br/>So in the next release, Padre should have a "Perl" menu that contains not only the existing Run menu entries, but new and actually-useful things like "Find that annoying unmatched brace that I can't see" and (if I have time) "Find that annoying unterminated quote that I can't see".<br/><br/>As usual, progress on Padre is continuous and the design is in flux, but in the next couple of versions I think we're really going to start to see Padre move past being a Notepad replacement and also act as a vehicle for a variety of handy PPI-based queries, transforms and other functionality (at least on a file by file basis).<br/><br/>At which point Padre becomes the editor you briefly switch over to do some things you can't do in your normal editor.<br/><br/>Which is at least a start towards world domination :)</p>

<h2>Features?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jplindstrom/">jplindstrom</a> on 2008-09-17T12:15:30</h3>
<p>Is there a roadmap or todo list for upcoming features?</p>

Padre v0.09 is on its way to CPAN and a linux executable can be found in the <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/wiki/Download" title="perlide.org">download folder</a perlide.org>
<p>
As of roadmap. We have a bunch of tickets on our
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/" title="perlide.org">web site</a perlide.org> but we don't have an exact order or schedule of what we are implementing when.</p>

<p>At the moment, mostly it seems to be Gabor and I scratching our various itches in parallel as fast as possible, with releases made at stable points when nothing particularly large is broken.</p>
