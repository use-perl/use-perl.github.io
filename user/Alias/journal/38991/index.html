<div class="span8">
<p>With TIOBE continuing to persist despite it's stupidity, it would appear we're now moving into the second phase witnessed by almost every flawed design.<br/><br/>That's right, people are now starting to "correct" their language's bad scores by adjusting their behaviours to match the incorrect design.<br/><br/>Delphi has done it, and with 0.02% of CPAN pages having the words "Perl programming" on it, it's probably time we did it too.<br/><br/>After all, we're just "correcting" our language's bad numbers.<br/><br/>But why not take it one (or ten) steps further towards it's logical conclusion.<br/><br/>If 4chan has taught us anything, it's that bad designs shouldn't just be tolerated. They should be stressed to the point of failing to truly demonstrate the asshattery of the people involved.<br/><br/>Now, since there are half a million pages currently on cpan.org that we could modify to include the word "Perl programming" why not go for a two-for-one, and add the words "brainfuck programming" as well.<br/><br/>Well, maybe not brainfuck. We'll need something that's already on the index. Personally I like the look of <a href="http://www.audiosynth.com/">SuperCollider</a>, a domain specific audio processing language with a 1994-era "homepage" with a rainbow background.<br/><br/>Lets make it our mission to help SuperCollider assume it's rightful place as an "A" ranked TIOBE language!</p>

<h2>Muahahaha</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sjn/">sjn</a> on 2009-05-18T07:18:50</h3>
<p>What a wonderful idea! How about new popularity surge for COBOL?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p><p>Although I suspect the TIOBE people would recognize this, and promptly ignore the bad data...</p>



<h2>Reverse that...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2009-05-18T08:50:33</h3>
If we were to reverse that, and put "This page is not about Perl programming" on all our other web pages... would it still be counted towards the TIOBE index?



<h2>YouTube: fast route to SuperCollider Programming</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Tim Bunce/">Tim Bunce</a> on 2009-05-18T08:58:22</h3>
I almost mentioned this in my <a href="http://blog.timbunce.org/2009/05/17/tiobe-index-is-being-gamed/" title="timbunce.org">blog post</a timbunce.org>... I think it's worth sharing now because boosting SuperCollider Programming to it's rightful place on the TIOBE Index is <em>clearly</em> a worthy cause.<br/><br/>TIOBE only assigns 7% weighting to YouTube (vs 23% to the other search engines) but the number of hits is much lower. So each video uploaded to YouTube with "SuperCollider Programming" in the title (or description, I presume) has a much greater impact on TIOBE then each extra web page.<br/><br/>(For those with lots of YouTube videos already uploaded perhaps someone could write a little script to append "SuperCollider Programming" to the description<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>The thing I like about the web though, is that since basically all of search.cpan.org is indexed, once small change to the page generator and we've added 50,000 odd page.</p>

<p>Depends if they're getting indexed by Google/Yahoo.</p><p>Maybe I should patch Test::Reporter to add it to the CPAN Tester reports themselves.</p><p>From this:</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>This distribution has been tested as part of the cpan-testers<br>effort to test as many new uploads to CPAN as possible.&nbsp; See<br>http://www.cpantesters.org/</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>To this:</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>This distribution has been tested as part of the cpan-testers<br>effort to test as many new uploads to CPAN as possible.&nbsp; See<br>http://www.cpantesters.org/ for more perl programming test results.</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>If the top testers upgraded, that would add 100K+ pages per month...

</p><p>[1] Until CPAN Testers 2.0, when those emails go away. Then you'll have to put it on each individual report page and make sure those 3.5+ million reports get indexed.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<h2>Doing my part to point out dumb</h2>

All 654 pages of <a href="http://perlbuzz.com/" title="perlbuzz.com">http://perlbuzz.com/</a perlbuzz.com> now have "Perl programming" in the header.

I'd love to add it to cpandeps and then let google crawl it again (there's another several hundred pages for you), but just can't handle the load.  Need tuits to do more caching.

<h2>Another idea</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ZuLuuuuuu/">ZuLuuuuuu</a> on 2009-05-18T19:23:44</h3>
Another idea: If Tiobe is that bad, maybe we can implement a system with more accurate algorithm to calculate the popularities of programming languages and prepare a web page to share the results to the rest of the world.

<p>This has already been done, twice!</p><p>The problem is that because TIOBE is a company, they have better PR. They've also been around a long time, which adds to the sense of officialdom.</p><p>If this problem could be solved by just making a better index, we wouldn't have this problem.</p>
