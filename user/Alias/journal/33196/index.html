<p><a href="http://svn.ali.as/">The Open Repository</a> is now back up and running again at <a href="http://svn.ali.as/cpan">http://svn.ali.as/cpan</a>.<br/><br/>Please note there are currently NO accounts set up other than my own, but read-only service is available and you can repoint any checkouts with uncommited changes to this new URI.<br/><br/>My various bug fixes and new modules are not yet commited to the new repository, but I will be starting to do that now.<br/><br/>Some issues continue with the repository manager, preventing providing accounts to other people.<br/><br/>I've come to the conclusion that both Insurrection and CommitBit are to much trouble for what I want in this specific case, and that I'll have to just write my own.<br/><br/>Insurrection continues to be largely abandoned and impossible to install.<br/><br/>CommitBit seems nice enough, but is based on Jifty, and to be honest I can't help but feel that it's both too heavy (in dependency terms) for my needs. Further, installing CommitBit didn't work because at the specific time I was installing it, CPAN Jifty wasn't compatible with the CPAN Jifty::DBI, and the CPAN CommitBit wasn't compatible with SVN CommitBit... and SVN Jifty failed to install for me due to an transient SVN problem that was patched before I had a chance to ask about it.<br/><br/>In any case, I do get the impression that Jifty is still evolving fairly quickly, and so using something that big that is moving that fast isn't really for me.<br/><br/>Of course, that's a criticism entirely unrelated to the quality of Jifty itself (which seems to be improving all the time) and totally unrelated to the needs to other people or other projects. I just don't want to use it for my repository manager.<br/><br/>While setting up the repository, I was reminded that the SVN configuration is just an Apache .htpasswd file.<br/><br/>What's interesting about this is that with a fairly simple target output format, and a limited amount of data that needs to be tracked, there's really nothing preventing me from creating an "old school" style application to solve this.<br/><br/>A simple CGI perl script that can track accounts, send an email, and can be installed by just dropping a .pl script into a cgi-bin directory.<br/><br/>In fact, the style feels very very ::Tiny to me, so maybe that is actually a good approach to take?<br/><br/>For the moment, I'm calling my repository manager TinyAuth.<br/><br/>The goal, no more than 1000 lines of code, and no task ever taking more than 2 page requests from the front page, ideally only 1. And simple enough layout to work even on mobile phone browsers, so I can give people commit bits from my phone without having to get the laptop out or have a proper internet connection :)<br/><br/>I violate a few of the ::Tiny principles though, since I'll probably want to use a dependency or three (Email::Stuff is attractive for the email parts, and I don't really want to rely on console sendmail.<br/><br/>So maybe I'll end up as SimpleAuth or some other name.<br/><br/>But we'll see.<br/><br/>In the mean time, CPAN uploads of new releases of my modules (and a couple of new modules) should resume now.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;d suggest at least adding CGI::Application or CGI::Prototype to the mix. Neither adds significant weight, except for declaring dependencies on template systems that they don&#x2019;t actually need in order to function. Maybe you can also get Sam Tregar and/or merlyn to fix that.</p>

<p>Among template systems, Template::Simple is probably what you want. HTML::Template doesn&#x2019;t have non-core dependencies either though.</p>

I won't be using a templating module, it would really just be overkill.<br><br>Instead I'm using a templating method which implements very small subset of Template Toolkit syntax... i.e. it just supports [% foo %].<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><code><br>sub template {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $self = shift;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $html = shift;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $args = shift || $self-&gt;args;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; foreach ( 0<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.. 10 ) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # Allow up to 10 levels of recursion<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $html =~ s/\[\%\s+(\w+)\s+\%\]/$args-&gt;{$1}/g;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return $html;<br>}<br></code>

<p>If that is <em>really</em> all you need&#8230; then go for it. But I find that even minimal scripts outgrow that functionality very quickly.</p>

<p>My main point was that you should take a look at the lightweight web frameworks for Perl, though. Even the tiniest apps benefit from them in my experience &#8211; as soon as you have more than 2 screens, you need to impose structure somehow. (Of course, variations of Greenspun&#8217;s 10th Rule apply to many things. You could build a rudimentary framework in situ &#8211; much like how CGI::Protoype got started&#8230;)</p>

<h2>SVN::Web plugin?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nik/">nik</a> on 2007-05-04T08:02:47</h3>
Have you considered writing it as a plugin for SVN::Web?  SVN::Web::AuthManager or similar? Writing new actions is <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/nikc/SVN-Web-0.53/lib/SVN/Web/action.pm" title="cpan.org">pretty simple</a cpan.org>.

I don't want to do this mainly because by having it as a standalone application I can potentially reuse it in situations other than SVN. Initially, anything else that runs off a<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.htpasswd file (like protected directories and WebDAV shares) but later there's some potential to add other targets (what, I'm not sure yet).
