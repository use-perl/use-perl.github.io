According to the excellent <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/" title="yahoo.com">YSlow plugin</a yahoo.com> for Firefox, about 900K of that is uncompressed YUI javascript.  There's no excuse for that -- the raw YUI libraries are very well documented, which is pointless for a production website.  I use <a href="http://script.aculo.us/" title="aculo.us">scriptaculous</a aculo.us> and <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/" title="prototypejs.org">prototype.js</a prototypejs.org> for my own work and I use <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/" title="yahoo.com">yuicompressor</a yahoo.com> to squish my JS and then gzip it.  Gzipped content works smoothly on all browsers except Safari.<br><br>To make it work with Safari too, you have name your file<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.jsgz instead of<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.js.gz and then do the following in your apache conf or<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.htaccess<p><blockquote> <div><tt>&lt;files *.jsgz&gt;<br>
&nbsp; ForceType text/javascript<br>
&nbsp; Header set Content-Encoding: gzip<br>&lt;/files&gt;</tt></div> </blockquote> With those tricks, I predict use.Perl.org can get about a factor of 20 compression.  The tricks work on <a href="http://salgsite.org/css/common.cssgz" title="salgsite.org">CSS</a salgsite.org> files too with a lower compression ratio.  Just being able to put comments in your JS/CSS without worrying about performance makes the extra work worthwhile.<br><br>And the YUI calendar.js at 212 KB?  Does slashcode actually use that anywhere?<br>

More to the point, does ANY of that shit get used on the front page?<br><br>If not, and they are just there for caching purposes, the script tags can be moved down to the end of the page just before the  so that the page renders FIRST and doesn't block while it pulls the JavaScript to cache it.<br>

Well, you know, with the so-called 'community' and its pool of people if not dwindling then certainly stagnating having five 'forks' of the same shit simply because someone needed to jerk themselves off so they could either have their own or just to shit on someone elses' stuff, you'd think somone would get a fucking clue that maybe it's not all that productive.

I don't have to be the effusive lavisher of praise to note the pathological egotism that prevails with those who, when they either don't get their way or want something of their own, decide to fragment that which already exists. I don't know if I'd call it a community so much as a collection of mutually self-interested egotists. There's plenty I don't really like about the look and feel of use.perl, but it does the job its supposed to and I respect the time, energy and resources that Pudge has invested in it.

You're just sore that the ultimate fork of a pre-existing fork, P6, remains the best thing that ever happened to P5.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>In ten years, the only thing I've ever read from you online that resembled praise was "... it does the job its supposed to and I respect the time, energy and resources that Pudge has invested in it,"  and that was thirty seconds ago.  Maybe I've missed the kindness, sweetness, and light that you spread everywhere I'm not, but I really think that much of the meanness, bitterness, and cynicism you find in the Perl community is exactly what you spread coming right back to you.  (Well, also IRC.  That's irredeemable.)</p> <p><blockquote> <div><em>You're just sore that...</em></div> </blockquote>

<p>No, I'm just certain that if <em>you</em> want to see kindness, sweetness, gentleness, and light from other people, you're not going to get it by berating them mercilessly and unprovokedly every random chance you happen to fly by.  These are not the kinds of lectures people listen to.</p>

<p>Try treating the rest of us as potentially responsible adults once in a while, rather than punishing the rest of us for some perceived or real slight a decade old that most of us weren't involved in, don't know about, can't fix, have no reason to apologize for, and don't particularly care about.  You might see better results.</p>

Honey, I've not even been around for much of the better part of three years...really even longer than that. Do you spend your days browsing the archives?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) And I don't think I've seen you do too much other than whine about how nobody gushes over the P6 cabal. I can't think of anyone who can say they should be first to cast stones on the lack of sweetness and light.
<p>
I'm not mary poppins, I've never claimed to be either. My role to play for the most part, as Gnat so astutely noted once, was to be the one to say what nobody else will. Sweetness and light doesn't exist in this small world.
</p><p>
What could be more stupid than to fork yet another use.perl website just because you had some sort of problem with how it loaded on your browser or something?  Maybe that makes me a big old meanie for pointing that out, but at least I'm not the asshole who is always there, ready to tell whomever that their project sucks and that they're 'moving forward' without you.

<p>Some dead guy who was very astute too once said &#8220;be the change you want to see in the world.&#8221; It might be gratifying to barge in at random times and berate people (for things that, by your own admission, you don&#8217;t even actually keep track of any longer), I don&#8217;t know. But if any progress ever happens, the contribution of your approach to it is guaranteed to be nil. In that sense, it is hard to see what sets you apart from the very people you criticise.</p> <p><blockquote> <div><p>What could be more stupid than to fork yet another use.perl website just because you had some sort of problem with how it loaded on your browser or something?</p></div> </blockquote>

<p>A <em>whole lot</em> of things.

I'm not always here but it frequently bothers me to see that things never change. It's more than a desire for 'something better' as that's a subjective guage and a frequent pedestal from which so many incursions are begun. I mean, nobody is going to be dumb enough to be honest about these things. Politics play more of a role than anything and I think you all do a far better job of bitching at each other than my rather infrequent fly-bys.

<p>If you really cared (and I have no illusion that you do), you could find out exactly what I've done in the past three years, including hundreds of commits, dozens of articles, countless answers to questions on mailing lists, hundreds of messages to mailing lists, a double handful of patches to Perl <em>5</em>, maybe a dozen public talks, a couple of books, technical edits of several books, three or four releases of Parrot, the minutes of almost every Perl 6 design meeting, and, yes, a couple of dozen rants and complaints.</p>

<p>Feel free to have the last word.  I suggest calling me a "whiny woman-hating man-child without the brains God gave sedimentary rocks."  I'll be over here, writing code, fixing bugs, mentoring new developers, improving performance, and revising documentation, just like Chris Dolan, Shlomi Fish, Andy Armstrong, and Andy Lester (not to mention Jarkko, Nicholas, Dave, Merijn, Hugo, Randal, Tom, Ilya, and countless others).</p>

Oh, blah, blah, blah. I've been busy with the spawn so, no, I've not been wasting my time on such things of late. I did plenty of that in the past but, seemingly, all you remember is my few rants so...tit for tat.
<p>
I wasn't complaining, merely pointing out that, as I've said before, you get the people you deserve by nobody ever learning how to do things like this instead of simply dividing interest and resources. I still don't think P6 will be forthcoming soon if ever because of these same dynamics that have been present since even before P6 was announced and have continued through the various projects within. When the WC awards are really, really stretching to find people to nominate, you'd think there'd be some sort of wondering as to why that might be.
</p><p>
What I do is simply watch and wait and occasionally comment on the more egregious things. You can put history into a wiki, but computers only remember what people tell them to.</p>

Maybe hfb measure accomplishment in lines of code written times number of times user programs caused said lines to be executed (maybe times amount of time saved by said users).  Or perhaps in words of explanation given times size of audience for said explanation (again maybe times time saved).

<p>Clearly there are other measures, but "I wrote a lot of code" and "I produced a lot of mailing list traffic" miss a lot of the picture.</p>

<p>I always respected the forkers a lot more, myself.  They were definitely a step above the people who whined and whined and whined about how things should go and what everybody else should do.</p>

<p>(<b>Please</b> don't misread that to be in any way about you.  I've only met you once and don't have you in mind at all; I'm thinking back to the participation I had in the early days of Perl 6; a participation which was a near-complete waste of time, not because Perl 6 was a bad idea, but because I was 100% <i>unqualified</i> for the task and I was in fact one of the whiners I am talking about.  But I hope I was nicer about it than some of the others I saw.</p>

<p>The theory of evolution has development following billions of parallel dead-ends before finding useful advancement.  That's the forkers.  Yep; most are dead-ends.  And it's entertaining to laugh at them!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  But they are the ones who put some effort (usually) into what they are saying, as opposed to idiots like me who just stand on the sideline and cry like babies that they can't make the community do what they want.</p>

<p>The thesis I stated then, namely, &#8220;I don&#8217;t use any site features that would require Javascript,&#8221; is demonstrably correct, as seen by the fact that despite having blocked all of the scripts the site loads ever since, I have had no trouble posting on use.perl (well, when it wasn&#8217;t down). And as far as I&#8217;m concerned, you needn&#8217;t lift a finger to fix the megabyte-size front page; the site works for me now the way I want it and that&#8217;s all I cared to achieve, irrespective of whether I needed to do something about it or not. I expect nothing at all of anyone else, despite the implication in your comment above.</p>

<p>My mistake was bringing my plight to you in hopes that you might consider this something obviously worth fixing for everyone who visits the site, instead of JFDI myself silently and getting on with life. I assumed that in the worst case you&#8217;d tell me to get lost; but in your need to stroke your smugness, you managed to be even less courteous than that. Figures that talking to you would be a waste of effort. Suffice to say, whatever unfeature is inflicted on use.perl in the future as a testbed for Slashdot (now there&#8217;s a place I really <em>really</em> don&#8217;t give a flying lemon about), I won&#8217;t be making that mistake again.</p>

<p>Wrong. None of that thread had anything to do with me trying to be right about anything. I wanted to know whether this issue would be fixed on the site or I would have to fix it locally. Instead of saying anything useful, you told me that I was wrong about various of my guesses. So I tried to get an answer as to whether any site features I use require Javascript, which you wouldn&#8217;t answer with a straight yes or no either.</p> <p><blockquote> <div><p>Your mistake was in being an asshole to me</p></div> </blockquote>

And yes, lines like <em>the interface I do actually use is trivial to implement without any use of Javascript whatsoever</em> (as if you could possibly know that) and <em>So how about giving an example of how a feature I use requires YUI stuff, instead of skirting the matter with "you don't know what it's for" hints?</em> are good examples of your assholishness.  Thanks for helping to demonstrate my case.<br><br>

There are various issues involved, but most people, just as Aristotle did, come in pointing fingers and telling me how to do things and how stupid I am for not doing those things, and I just couldn't care less to explain myself in such situations.  If you'd like to talk about specific things away from the assholes like Aristotle, ping me.  However, most of the issues people have with speed are due to two things: hardware (which is changing very soon) and serving software (which is not changing until we move to new hardware, because I have better things to do than to implement changes to a system that is going away very soon).  We implemented many of the software changes a couple of months ago on Slashdot, so we know they work, and they'll wind their way down to useperl in due course.<br><br>

<p><div class="quote">I (possibly mistakenly) thought that use.perl was your sort of beta-testing/experimental site for Slash stuff.</div> No, that's correct, but in this case, we had some changes and the urgency of fixing and scale of problem dictated that we work on Slashdot directly, and as the issues are primarily not in the Slash code (though related to it), they just never got "backported," and then with the new network and hardware coming, I just didn't devote my own resources to bother doing it at all.<br><br>I just got my cryptocard for the new network today.

Hi Pudge!
</p>

<p>
First of all, let me thank you for all the work you've put into use.perl.org and making it what it is today. I really appreciate it and I think I speak for most of us.
</p>

<p>
In any case, I decided to start <a href="http://perl.net.au/wiki/User:Shlomif/use.perl.org_Problems" title="perl.net.au">wiki page concentrating the problems that we currently see with use.perl.org</a perl.net.au>. Everyone can contribute to it, even without registration. It's not meant as a "Why use.perl.org sucks" page, but rather as a checklist for what to improve so the site will be better.
</p>

<p>
You can also use the attached <a href="http://perl.net.au/wiki/User_talk:Shlomif/use.perl.org_Problems" title="perl.net.au">discussion page</a perl.net.au>.
