<p><a href="http://svn.ali.as/cpan/releases/PPI-1.202_03.tar.gz">http://svn.ali.as/cpan/releases/PPI-1.202_03.tar.gz</a><br/><br/>Moving from PPI 1.202 to 1.203 has turned into a fairly tortuous affair, mainly because of the irrepressible Chris Dolan trickle-commiting failing parse cases into the repository, which of course I HAVE to fix before I can release the next version, because my release automation simply wouldn't stand for that.<br/><br/>As the failing cases get stranger and stranger, I need to fix more "interesting" bugs and bad assumptions, and add more features.<br/><br/>So what should be a release that happens about once a month or so has turned into a 9 month affair that is probably more deserving of being 1.250 rather than 1.203.<br/><br/>I've bumped a number of deps to flush out some problems, removed various back-compatibility issues, and added very early support for Perl 6, or at least for supporting the use of "use v6-alpha;".<br/><br/>The v6 support happened because now CPAN::Mini supports offline mode, so also did CPAN::Mini::Extract, and thus so also did CPAN::Metrics, which needed to parse all of CPAN, which meant I needed to handle KindaPerl6::Grammar, etc etc.<br/><br/>So if you use any significant tools based on PPI, I'd appreciate a quick round of testing to validate that they all still work properly with this new release. If everything looks good, I'll flick it to a production version tomorrow.

All tests, including author ones, pass with no problems.

Thanks.<br><br>Unfortunately, when I tested the production version this morning, it failed. So we probably need to synchronize releases.

In my defense, for every two failing tests I've committed, I've fixed one of them myself.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br>

Adam,<br><br>I just noticed that 1.202_03 doesn't have any updates in the Changes file.  Let me know if you want me to write any of those.  My svn log messages were pretty adequate for that purpose, but I have not followed your work very closely.

D'oh, never mind!  I was looking at the Changes file for 1.201 by mistake...

Whenever you add things, please note it in changes.<br><br>Thanks.
