<p><b>Update: This is now working, and you can see it in action on Padre trunk</b><br/><br/>The recent Padre 0.51 contains the second phase of "Save Intuition", a set of small tweaks designed to make saving quicker and less distracting.<br/><br/>In the first round I discussed earlier, Padre started to guess what it thinks the file name should be for the file based on the content.<br/><br/>In the second round, Padre will now also try to put the save dialog into the correct directory as well.<br/><br/>The logic goes like this.<br/><br/><i>"New files probably belong to the same project as the file that was open just before the user triggered a File -> New action. If this is a Perl file, in a Perl project, and we're saving 'package Foo::Bar', the user probably wants to save into $project/lib/Foo. Set dialog path to that directory, if it already exists."</i><br/><br/>My hope is that this feature is subtle enough that most people won't even notice it (or if they do, it's with momentary happy surprise and after that they take it for granted).<br/><br/>Of course, there's gaps in this logic. What if the directory does NOT exist? In the 0.51 release, it just bails out and so falls back to the normal choice for the save directory. Creating nested directory trees without the user asking for it is risky business.<br/><br/>But what if I specifically want that?<br/><br/>If I'm making a new class for an existing project, surely I should be able to just wave my hands at Padre and say "Save in the usual place" and have that just happen without showing a dialog at all (unless Padre gets confused and can't determine what the "usual place" is).<br/><br/>This third phase of Save Intuition is what I plan to be my main feature for 0.52 (assuming I can get it to work). I'm hoping to take Ctrl-Shift-S for this, so it acts just like a normal save, but adding the extra shift key adds more DWIM to the process.

<h2>Great feature</h2>

It is pretty annoying to re-enter the folder you want every time you save a new file (and the same goes for opening another file).<br/><br/>So this is a really nice feature, and will certainly be more convenient to use.<br/><br/>Cheers!
