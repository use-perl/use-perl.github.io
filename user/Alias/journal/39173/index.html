<p>Because I've been distracted writing my new CPAN dependency graph generator (to repair the main flaw in the <a href="http://ali.as/top100/">CPAN Top 100</a> website) I haven't been paying the website a whole lot of attention in the last week or so.<br/><br/>I just run the website data generator once or twice a week, and other than that, I'm focusing on creating the next iteration of the support software.<br/><br/>After updating the data file today, imagine my surprise when a new module absolutely roared ahead of the previous #1 highest score, posting a new record of over 500,000 FAILure points.<br/><br/>It would appear that the June 18th release of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBD::mysql">DBD::mysql</a> was something of a disaster, and the high number of modules that depend on MySQL means that the impact on end users is very high.<br/><br/>It's good to see that when something like this happens, it is highlighted on the list very quickly and very obviously.<br/><br/>However, in retrospect I'm somewhat disappointed that it took this long to highlight it (because I don't run the updater often enough). What if it just took a while because it took a few weeks to gradually climb up to the top of the list, fighting against high-dependency modules with one or two rare failures, that aren't growing so fast.<br/><br/>I'm wonder what might be done to spot these dramatic failures faster, within a few days of their release, rather than having to wait a week or so.<br/><br/>Even starting to do something like that will probably require a serious improvement to the update date of the data that feeds the website, and changes to teach the analyser about the concept of time.<br/><br/>Food for thought, certainly.<br/><br/>The question now of course, is how high a really big OMGIBROKECPAN event might score. Something in the vicinity of several million failure points certainly seems possible, especially if the number of CPAN Testers installs grows.

<h2>Problems with tests...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/DiamondInTheRough/">DiamondInTheRough</a> on 2009-06-28T04:23:08</h3>
<p>That one, the tests need to take the blame for, I think.</p><p>It's not that the module doesn't run, it's that one of the tests does not skip, it fails when there is no mysql server available, I think.</p><p>I'll have to find a round tuit - and I have an acute shortage at the moment - to help them in that regard.</p>
