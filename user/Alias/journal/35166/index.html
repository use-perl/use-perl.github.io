<p><a href="http://ali.as/download/strawberry-perl-5.10.0-beta-2.exe">http://ali.as/download/strawberry-perl-5.10.0-beta-2.exe</a><br/><br/>This is the second beta release for <a href="http://strawberryperl.com">Strawberry Perl</a> 5.10.0.<br/><br/>The following changes were made.<br/><br/>- Squelched noisy warnings in CPAN due to missing minicpan<br/><br/>- Force install to c:\strawberry instead of c:\strawberry-perl when Strawberry 5.8.8 was already installed and Inno Setup tried to be smart.<br/><br/>Please note you should uninstall any previous Perl installs before installing Strawberry Perl, due to path issues they will not co-exist.<br/><br/>- Force the datetime on all files a few days into the past to avoid files from the future that were confusing dmake.<br/><br/>- Added the gmp C library.<br/><br/>This release is still missing some documentation and Start menu links, but is otherwise identical to the final version, and you should not need to upgrade once you have beta 2 installed.<br/><br/>As before, please report any problems in the comments.<br/><br/>If all goes well and we don't need another test release, I will be able to upload Strawberry Perl 5.10.0 Final in around 24 hours.</p>

<h2>Clarification</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2007-12-20T17:48:55</h3>
When you say "Force install to c:\strawberry" that doesn't mean I have to install it there or on the "C:" drive right?

The current installer uses C:\strawberry and you cannot change that location.



<h2>Re:Clarification</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2007-12-20T21:46:59</h3>
Yes, it must be installed to that location.<br><br>Relocatable Perl installation is currently not available on Win32, but I plan to investigate that after this first release.

<h2>It seems to mostly work :)</h2>

I made a version of the TWiki 4.2.0 windows installer that uses StrawberryPerl beta 2, and so far, viewing and editing works fine.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, the searching, which shells out to run grep does not. I have not found time to look into why - I'm about to leave for Brisbane, and then won't have access to Windows until I come back<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:/)<br/><br/>I expect that the code that shells out to run grep is assuming that it works like in ActiveState, and that Strawberry perl exec's more like unix - but I don't know for sure.<br/><br/>Does anyone wat to make sure its a TWiki issue, rather than a Strawberry Perl one?<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Sven

Strawberry Perl does a straight MinGW/gcc compile of the official Perl source code, with zero modifications. That's the main feature of it.<br><br>If there's a bug in Strawberry Perl then it's either 1) A Twiki bug 2) A Perl 5.10.0 bug<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
