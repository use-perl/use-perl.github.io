<p><a href="http://strawberryperl.com/download/strawberry-perl-5.10.0.1.exe">http://strawberryperl.com/download/strawberry-perl-5.10.0.1.exe</a> (17.4Mb, English, 2000/XP/2003).<br/><br/>Completed during the Oslo QA Hackathon as planned, I'm happy to announce the release (just barely on schedule) of the April 2008 release of Strawberry Perl, before the second monday of the quarter (I uploaded in time for Hawaii to get it).<br/><br/>I'm linking the release executable here first for a few day before I update the main website, just in case something snuck in I need to fix.<br/><br/>If there's no reported (fixable) problems reported, I will update the website when I get home from Oslo in a few days.<br/><br/>The most notable changes for the new release are the inclusion in the default install of libwin32 (by far the most downloaded module on cpan.strawberryperl.com) and Expat/XML::Parser.<br/><br/>On top of that additionally both PAR::Dist and Randy Kobes' non-SOAP-capable fork of the current CPAN head have been installed.<br/><br/>One late obstacle was a problem in ExtUtils::Command where the cp command does not update mtime on Win32 (because Win32 syscopy behaves differently to Unix syscopy).<br/><br/>This was greatly confusing dmake, resulting in many failures. I've added a temporary patch to make a utime call to update the mtime after each syscopy on Win32 in ExtUtils::Command::cp.<br/><br/>As usual, any immediate feedback please just post a comment here.<br/><br/>Please note Vista support is not available in this release, but the odds for the next cycle are looking better.</p>

<h2>Upgrade Path</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/systems/">systems</a> on 2008-04-08T11:54:42</h3>
How to upgrade do I just Install on top of an existing version!
<br> <br>
And do you plan to include popular c libraries like libgd etc<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
<br> <br>
Finally would you please add more features to the site a wiki a forum, where one can discuss issues with packages etc<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
<br> <br>

1. Currently, it is not possible to upgrade. You will need to uninstall first. I'm working on resolving this problem, but a fix wasn't ready for this cycle, and I've committed to maintaining the quarterly release tempo.<br><br>2. If they are reasonable light weight I'm open to bundling additional pre-built C libraries. But I'm not going to be the one to build the actual packages, as I'm not a C master by any means. I will however, take any reasonable pre-built package and build it in.<br><br>3. I do plan to add a few more features to the website, based on feedback from the last cycle. It almost certainly won't have any application-type stuff like a wiki, but it can certainly have a link to the most appropriate place to discuss Strawberry.<br>
