<div class="span8">
<p>If one thing stands out from recent discussions on The Perl Renaissance (the whole set of modern/enlightened/marketing blog posts) it's that we don't properly recognise that we are so unskilled at promotion that we don't know what we don't know about the subject.<br/><br/>We throw around words like "Modern" and "Enlightened" and "Directory of Marketing" because they are the best we can do, because we don't know how to name things well.<br/><br/>We discuss the competition for mindshare as if our users are an Economist's mythical "Rational Consumer" and only care about release schedules, and we grasp at ideas like paying people to take a role, with no grounding for knowing if that type of role is what is needed.<br/><br/>I'm just as bad, but I at least try to remember how little I know about most thing. My websites are either <a href="http://svn.ali.as/">ultra-minimalist</a>, <a href="http://ali.as/">intentionally devoid of style</a>, or aim for the <a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">simpler is better</a> look (which is about the best I can do when I don't have a real designer to draw source material from).<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm fortunate to have spent some time working for <a href="http://www.razorfish.com">one of the world's best design companies</a> (or more specifically, the Australian "Amnesia Solutions" office before they were bought and aggregated into the larger entity). At the time I didn't even have enough knowledge about design to recognise that they were good, I've only come to realise that years later.<br/><br/>But, I can say that I've spent enough time working side by side with "real designers" and promotion people that I've gained at least the knowledge of how truly bad I am at design and promotion.<br/><br/>This isn't a problem that we (the mirror ball crew) can solve ourself, and the sooner we acknowledge that the better. I certain have nothing much to say on the subject, other than to say how little I know about the subject.<br/><br/>Like <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">other giant Open Problems</a>, often the solution is not to try to solve the problem at all. Especially when you can't throw money at the problem.<br/><br/>Often the solution is to acknowledge you have a problem, build a suitable collaborative space for solving the problem, be inviting to outsiders or fringe members of the community that have the knowledge you need, and then do the best you can within the collaborative space to partly solve the problem until you can recruit even better people.<br/><br/>And at each step, you (as the community leader with no domain knowledge) deal with the tools to make sure that the output of every hour of work from the People Who Know is captured, reused and recycled.<br/><br/>That the work for the community is held by the community, so when your rare and valued knowledge giants run out of the time to help you and move on, you can safely stand on their shoulders.<br/><br/>This is pretty much the exact process that was used to solve the <a href="http://strawberryperl.com">Perl on Windows Problem</a>, and it's the approach that is being used to solve the <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Perl IDE Problem</a>.<br/><br/>So I propose the following. If your blog is not stunningly beautiful, you don't get a say in how we solve our PR issues. If you don't have a blog, or engage in other forms of promotional work, you don't get a say.<br/><br/>You don't contribute to the solution in any useful way, so you don't count.<br/><br/>What you can do though, is run infrastructure. Even if the web people left for PHP, Perl still holds on to it's core community of sysadmins.<br/><br/>The existence of the DOZENS of websites, mirror networks, databases, automated testing infrastructure, analysis sites, forums and search engines is testament to our ability to build and run infrastructure better than most of our competitors.<br/><br/>So lets stop this bumbling conversation and do what we do best. Lets build and run the infrastructure so that the real people able to solve the problem. So people like <a href="http://blog.newint.org/tech/2009/07/26/is-the-perl-community-schizophrenic/index.shtml">Phillip Smith</a> (and others with <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/">competant design skills</a>) can have the support they need to solve these issues with as little process overheads as possible. of effort.<br/><br/>I'm happy to step up and put my server where my mouth is.<br/><br/>As a starting point, I'll be creating a new sub-repository off of <a href="http://svn.ali.as/">http://svn.ali.as/</a> specifically for the collective storage of design materials, should you be generous enough to donate any.<br/><br/>My little repository management tool is simple enough that it should serve as a useful basis for design-type people to run it themselves (even if it's ugly, but I'm willing to work on that and it is templatable...).<br/><br/>If anyone has design material they would like to contribute, just say the word and I'll set up an account for you. I'm happy to take any contributions you wish to give.<br/><br/>File formats for commercial tools are welcome. The design world is still largely run on commercial tools and we need to be willing to deal with and accept that.<br/><br/>When someone comes along with something better than my infrastructure (I'm fully aware svn is not entirely ideal for large amounts of binary data) I'll happily stand aside and let that better thing be the place to store material.<br/><br/><i>Update: As my first contribution to making Perl better looking, the Padre team has chosen the Blue Morpho Butterfly as it's logo, and I've added the initial <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Screenshots/icon.png">16 x 16 pixel application icon</a> for it.</i></p>

I think I better write down my idea.<p>
Take one of the web sites related to the Perl community and send out a call to the <a href="http://www.oswd.org/" title="oswd.org">Open Source Web Designers</a oswd.org> to create a design for it.
Hopefully you get several suggestions. You pick one. You go.

You get a nice custom made site.<br>
The designer gets a site that is (or will be) seen by many people and is linked to his site promoting him/her.

If you have a specific idea for how you want Perl to change, you christen it "Good Perl" or something, then repeat that term endlessly.  One of these days, after I decide what I want Perl to become, I'll get around to releasing "Cool Perl" and/or "Sexy Perl."
</p><p>This is pure bullshit.  Perl took over from C and SH back in the day because it let people sling around text files with minimal effort.  And Ruby on Rails is handing Perl its own ass now because it lets people script up a shiny-looking web page with minimal effort (also because DHH knows how to use hair gel...).  If you want to "market" Perl, first use it to solve your own problems, then package up your code in a way that others can use it.</p>

Try "chromatic's," or "strict and warnings and Moose," or (I guess) "rakudo."  My point, which seems to have sadly been lost, is that "meaningless-positive-adjective Perl" is standard marketing bullshit, and implicitly assumes that your audience is a pack of semi-morons.  It's no better than "Enterprise Perl Bean Solutions."  Please don't do that.</p>

Agreed.  But to retain some credibility, the name should be both descriptive and value-neutral.  "Extreme Programming" and "Waterfall Programming" both succeed because they describe the relevant processes without claiming that they are either good or bad.  "Perl" and "Linux" do as well, to some extent, because they are just random words that are easy to Google.  In contrast, "modern" and "enlightened" are singularly lousy choices: they have generic positive connotations, but no real meaning.  For example, if we were still "enlightenment thinkers" and "modern philosophers," we would be using Newtonian physics in our arguments about how the Mind controls the Body through the pituitary gland.</p>

<h2>Design != Marketing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bango/">bango</a> on 2009-07-28T08:40:11</h3>
You make a good point.<br/><br/>But you also seem to be confusing design with marketing - they are not one and the same thing. I know they are related, but just because someone has an eye for visual design does not mean they automatically make a good candidate for marketing perl.<br/><br/>That said, it is also clear that many of the key perl-related websites look shockingly amateur-ish (look at the state of this place!) and would benefit from some quality design input.



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Design != Marketing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/zby/">zby</a> on 2009-07-28T09:29:21</h3>
Yeah - marketing is a broader term than advertising.  It is not only about communicating - it is also defining the audience - i.e. finding the market for the product, finding out where it can be the most useful.

<p>Great conversation here. Glad that people are willing to engage in it thoughtfully.

(I'll concede the point about DHH's hair.) They're using it for all kinds of crazy stuff, like writing desktop applications and large-scale messaging services like Twitter. (All things that Perl can do equally well.)</p><p>Regardless, I think a major point is being missed in these arguments: the people making these "shiny-looking web pages" are doing the grassroots marketing for Ruby, and Rails, and so on, e.g.: "Hey, did you know that Yadda-yadda was built with programming-language-of-the-day?" "No kidding? I gotta try that..."</p><p>So that's point #1: "solve your own problems" isn't quite right. Grassroots marketing is helping other people solve <em>their</em> problems with your solution. Admittedly, I think that's what you're saying with "package up your code in a way that others can use it."</p><p>Point #2 is that most of the people using frameworks like RoR and Django have made the choice to learn them <em>recently</em>. FIve years ago, nobody I know was programming primarily in Python or Ruby.  And it's not like there was a glut of Ruby and Python University graduates looking for frameworks; they all had to make a choice to learn something new. </p><p>So why did they choose these other languages and frameworks? Perhaps it was marketing "claptrap," perhaps it was hype and shiny Web sites. Those surely played a part. However, the other aspect is -- as we've all been talking about -- <strong>perception.</strong> Perceptions, and first impressions, of the language, its community, its resources and so on, all impact people's likelihood to take that first step into learning something new (or coming back). </p><p>I've heard it argued that the Perl community doesn't really want an avalanche of new people -- signal-to-noise and all that garbage. However, if we want to see those showcase sites, and applications, running Perl -- if we want the grassroots marketing that brings -- Perl must do a better job of <strong>communicating clearly</strong> about itself. </p><p>Communicating clearly is everything discussed above. It's the marketing "claptrap," it's the shiny-looking Web sites, and its a community that appears to openly want people to adopt this language, because it's the best damn language we've got. </p>

Desktop applications?  I haven't seen any yet (I don't count web apps), so can you point me in the right direction?

<p>AFAIK, Twitter is just a shiny web app that throws a lot of servers at a problem.  Other than the web interface, it seems like the whole thing could be done with text files and a UDP server.  Rails actually seems like a terrible fit for what Twitter is doing; it seems better suited for the simple, low-traffic web interfaces that most small businesses want than for a high-traffic buffered message queue.</p><blockquote><div><p>Admittedly, I think that's what you're saying with "package up your code in a way that others can use it."</p></div></blockquote><p>
Exactly.  UNIX, C, Perl 5, and Rails worked because they were first written to solve actual problems, then cleaned up so they could be used by others.  I expect Perl 6 will fail because it's not directed at an actual problem ("keep Perl moving" and "make Perl clean" are too vague).</p><blockquote><div><p>most of the people using frameworks like RoR and Django have made the choice to learn them recently.</p></div></blockquote><p>
Fads count for a lot in programming.  Perl, Python, and Ruby are all roughly similar at a technical level (though Perl gets variable scoping right), so if I don't know any of them, then all else being equal, I'll choose the one most likely to make me look cool and/or get me a job.  But immediate usefulness also counts: if one of them has a ready-made solution for my specific problem, then I'll probably choose that one.  Perl seems to have done well 10 years ago for its text munging and CGI handling.  I (thankfully) don't have to write web apps, but Ruby became popular because other programmers were forced to write them, and Rails made that less painful.  I hope people don't lose sight of the fact that the most important goal of any programming tool is to be useful.  You don't need to shine a diamond, and you can't shine a turd.</p>

<p>Just to take one example, "the AUTOLOAD subroutine should be able to decline a request" may be a shortcoming of the Perl language, and may annoy some Perl programmers, but it's not a "problem" in the sense I intended.  "I need to offer my company's widgets for sale on the web" is a problem.  "I need to convert this UniProt file to FASTA" is a problem.  If you design a programming language while thinking about programming languages, you get Scheme.</p>

I wonder how you balance elegance and the smallest set of primitives necessary to combine into sufficiently powerful abstractions.

<p>I missed a "solely" there: "If you design a programming language while thinking *solely* about programming languages, you get Scheme."  If you look at the languages that endure, most were designed by smart people with specific problems to solve:  John Backus wanted to TRANslate FORmulas to machine code, and created FORTRAN; Dennis Ritchie wanted to program his PDP-11 in something higher-level than assembly, and created C; etc.</p><p>Perl fit(s) into this tradition.

<h2>Don't just market the language</h2>

<p>As much as I think a more a uniform style and message would be great for Perl, I also think that releasing and marketing an application that non-Perl people would find cool and useful could do as much to fix Perl's image problem as anything else.</p><p>After using this fictional application, a user might see that it is written in Perl and think "Hey, I didn't know that Perl can do that". They might then look at the source code and think, "Hey, this isn't the same ugly Perl that I remember from the mid 90s."</p><p>A good example of this for me was Rails. When Rails was released I didn't know much about Ruby, but that one project prompted me to look into the language. It wasn't the marketing coming out of the Ruby camp that inspired me so much as the cool things you could do with Rails and clear messaging on the Rail's website.</p>

<p>More and more as I read through these discussions and debates, it makes me wonder how they can be resolved.  I doubt all the players involved are going to start agreeing.  Most projects have pretty clear leadership to resolve these kind of problems.

<p>I thought so, but who then?  It seems there's no single person or even group who has a leadership role, which is why there's schizophrenia.  I guess that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's not exactly comforting when a bunch of the players appear to be at odds about which direction to take the project.</p><p>C'est la vie.
