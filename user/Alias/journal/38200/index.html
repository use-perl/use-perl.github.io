<p>The not-so-secret second Sekrit I've been working on for a little while has been the productisation of Perl 6, by reusing the Strawberry building system. The idea for Vanilla Perl 6 came about when someone at YAPC::NA mentioned that just about everyone working on Win32 parrot was doing so on top of Strawberry Perl.<br/><br/>I'd hoped that I could just build parrot and perl6 on top of the Strawberry build process, then rip the Perl 5 stuff out of the package once Perl 6 was built.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, despite trying several different methods, the Parrot/Perl6 currently available appears to be too immature to support packaging via Perl::Dist.<br/><br/>This isn't an issue with either the completeness of the implementation of Parrot, or the completeness of the implementation of Rakudo.<br/><br/>The problem in the current package is that all the utterly basic things needed to support packaging (like Configure.pl --prefix or make install or having an easy way to compile out all the debugging symbols) just don't work well enough for me to build a Perl::Dist-based distribution.<br/><br/>That's not to say it doesn't build though. It does build for me, and I can get all the way to a working perl6.exe binary. A number of Perl hackers had a fun time at OSDC::AU mucking around with Perl 6.<br/><br/>And I'm not saying a distribution couldn't be built at all. What I am saying is that there's already 5,000-10,000 lines of code in Perl::Dist that deals with all the weirdness of building C and Perl stuff on Windows, and it's still not enough to deal with the extra new weirdness in Parrot/Perl6.<br/><br/>Since this project was only ever viable for me as a low-work, high-yield project, I'm abandoning it for now, until the Parrot developers can come up with a build solution for people that aren't Parrot developers.<br/><br/>I'm told that it is a goal for 0.9, so I'll try building Vanilla again after that release.<br/><br/>If anyone would like to try to continue where I left off, the code is at<br/><br/><a href="http://svn.ali.as/cpan/trunk/Perl-Dist-Parrot">http://svn.ali.as/cpan/trunk/Perl-Dist-Parrot</a><br/><br/>If you try to run this, please ensure you have the svn versions of Perl-Dist and Perl-Dist-Strawberry installed.</p>
