<p>Thanks to everybody that responded to my fictional scenario, although apparently some people missed the stress on the "fictional" bit.<br/><br/>Certainly the specific suggestions weren't meant to be hard and fast specific "I want it exactly this way" points, and when I do do that sort of thing I try to make it a rule for myself not to put forward specific proposals unless I'm willing to back them up myself.<br/><br/>The other bit of missing background is that I'd _already_ had a talk to Bill about the visibility issue at OSCON over lunch, and so I'd intended it more as a nudge than anything else.<br/><br/>However the one reminder I would like to make to the various people who commented is that by virtue of even starting a comment like "I know $foo, and they..." you are already speaking from a somewhat jaded position.<br/><br/>90% of the Perl community in _this_ country and I'm sure other countries at a similar distance will NEVER get to meet the members of the TPF, or see them at a conference, or have any particular reason to email them.<br/><br/>With those channels largely closed to them, for many people like this the Perl foundation website, or the blog, IS the Perl Foundation. And so to reach these people that you mostly don't know exist, visibility needs to be on broadcast channels, not on interpersonal channels.</p>

We are working in an ideal world here, or at least a virtual one, so the point about some people being in the wrong hemisphere is answered by these maps:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.flourish.org/upsidedownmap/" title="flourish.org">http://www.flourish.org/upsidedownmap/</a flourish.org>
