<p>Back in 2005 in <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Alias/journal/23820">only my fifth use.perl post ever</a>, I outlined an idea I had been developing for a couple of years that I called "Trailer Theory".<br/><br/>A few years ago on my Portable Perl world hack'a'tour, I took with me a lightning talk version of the concept. It was a pretty crude talk but was received, it seemed, fairly well by the development community.<br/><br/>Since that trip, and inspired by the unexpected conversion of my "Perl is unparsable" claims in the PPI docs into a formal mathematical proof (complete with "Kennedy's Lemma") I've been wondering if this "Trailer Theory" idea could really be developed as a proper scientific proof, and if so what would that look like.<br/><br/>A couple of months ago I presented a new version of the talk at Ignite Sydney, speaking to an mixed audience of Twitterati, social media, advertising and journalist types.<br/><br/>I've rebuilt the talk from scratch and tried to outline the same idea, but in the form of a kind of layman's Economics Proof.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy the result.<br/><br/><a href="http://igniteshow.com/videos/using-economics-make-movies-suck-less">Adam Kennedy - Using Economics to make movies suck less</a><br/><br/><i>
Notes for other speakers:<br/><br/>1. Ignite advances slides every 15 seconds, no clickers allowed. This turns out to take a shitload of practice to get right.<br/><br/>2. When someone says to you "Here's your mark, you need to stay on this line to be in the fixed spot" it helps to pay attention. FAIL :)
