<div class="span8">
<p><a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">The Zen of Python</a> is a set of 20 aphorisms that "succinctly channels the BDFL's guiding principles for Python's design".<br/><br/>Some of these are contradictory, or consist of pairs saying "This is true. But not really". But we can ignore all that.<br/><br/>Because one of them stands out clearly at the top.<br/><br/><b>Beautiful is better than ugly</b><br/><br/>Beauty is something Perl does really badly, because the Perl community as a group trends towards pragmatists and sysadmins. We lost the "front end" (HTML-side) of the community to PHP long ago, and never really recovered.<br/><br/>Perl has a public reputation of having ugly code. This can be true, but is often incorrect or besides the point. But with a stereotype like this in play the <b>LAST</b> thing we want to do is have ugly websites, which only serve to reinforce "Perl (code) is ugly" to the uninformed.<br/><br/>This is especially true in the case of our oldest core websites.<br/><br/><b><a href="http://perl.org/">http://perl.org/</a></b> is horrible.<br/><br/>An 800-wide fixed-width site with dark, block colours, small type in a link colour not clearly distinguishable from black to non-perfect eyes and purple "visited links" ala 1998 and dense clusters of links with no descriptions, ratings or ranking.<br/><br/>It's slogan is "When you need perl, think perl.org".<br/><br/>But clearly not many people do, with the number of distinct visitors to search.cpan.org alone running 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than perl.org.<br/><br/>The "download @ % Perl" image link is ugly and doesn't even look clickable and the yellow box that says "Where do you want to go tomorrow?" is both meaningless and out of place.<br/><br/>Even as a "directory", the website fails horribly to help me with anything I want to do.<br/><br/><a href="http://cpan.org/">http://cpan.org/</a> is almost as bad.<br/><br/>It's minimalist, contains almost no information, and itself only serves as a directory to other CPAN websites.<br/><br/>But of course it also has a website design circa 1998, doesn't actually link to most of the CPAN-related websites at all, and doesn't even have a search box! You have to read through three search website descriptions and pick one before you can actually search.<br/><br/>And lets not forget <a href="http://perl.com/">http://www.perl.com/</a>, which has (admittedly very slowly) degraded over the years under O'Reilly's stewardship.<br/><br/>The irony in this situation is that the most useful link on http://perl.com/ is the link to "our expanded news coverage" at <a href="http://perl.oreilly.com/">http://perl.oreilly.com/</a>, which is a far far better website than perl.com. Even though everything on perl.oreilly.com is based around commercial services offered by O'Reilly, it is a much more useful resource for commercial Perl people when compared to perl.com.<br/><br/>When someone turns up to the perl.com, perl.org or cpan.org websites with some task in mind, we don't do much of anything to help them get where they are going.<br/><br/>Looking through the list of all the other Perl websites, the look and feel disaster just keeps going on and on.<br/><br/><a href="http://learn.perl.org/">http://learn.perl.org/</a> is just a three page ugly clone of the ugly perl.org website, with two of those three pages links back to perl.org.<br/><br/><a href="http://history.perl.org/">http://history.perl.org/</a> is another three page ugly mid-nineties style website, although this one isn't a copy of perl.org. It's a whole different ugly.<br/><br/><a href="http://search.cpan.org/">http://search.cpan.org/</a> is simple, clean, suitably elegent and has a search box right on the front page, where you'd expect it. And, I'm sure partly because of this, it also has the highest traffic of any Perl website.<br/><br/><a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/">http://cpanratings.perl.org/</a> is another ugly copy of the perl.org website, but feels more comfortable in that skin, because it's behaviour more like a simple review blog instead of an actual website, and it points you in plain language directly at the three things you might actually want to do when you arrive there.<br/><br/><a href="http://annocpan.org/">http://annocpan.org/</a> isn't too bad, but has a completely different colour scheme from the rest of the Perl websites (most of which are blue) and is to some extent "confusingly similar" to search.cpan.org.<br/><br/>Surely it would be nicer if some of the annotation Javascript magic was just merged into search.cpan, and you only went to the main annocpan site when you REALLY need to dive into annotations vs revisioning.<br/><br/><a href="http://dev.perl.org/">http://dev.perl.org/</a> is another ugly perl.org clone, with a front page that's basically just a joke (although hey, it is at least informative).<br/><br/><a href="http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/">http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/</a> is different from BOTH the perl.org style and the rt.cpan.org style.<br/><br/><a href="http://dbi.perl.org/">http://dbi.perl.org/</a> is horrible, but at least it knows that it is and is going to change.<br/><br/><a href="http://perl.apache.org/">http://perl.apache.org/</a> is reasonably competent (although you'd expect that from a group of people who are completely web-focused).<br/><br/>The YAPC website at <a href="http://www.yapc.org/">http://www.yapc.org/</a> is decent, which you'd hope for a conference website who's entirely reason for existing at all is as marketing. O'Reilly's OSCON website is of course great (although we've finally reached the end-state, where the string "The Perl Conference" does not actually appear anywhere on the website, that Google can see anyway).<br/><br/><a href="http://www.pm.org/">http://www.pm.org/</a> is another horribly plain website with a front page image circa 2000, although at least it's not fixed width.<br/><br/><a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/">http://perldoc.perl.org/</a> is actually pretty good looking, and does look like something you'd expect from a document archive. In that sense, it has a similar suitability-for-purpose feel to the Oracle documentation archives.<br/><br/>Except, of course, perldoc.perl.org doesn't actually have all the Perl documentation like the typical visitor would expect.<br/><br/>At the Birmingham hackathon Jon mentioned something about this being because he builds the website on his laptop, and it would take too long to upload via FTP/rsync if he built it for all versions of Perl.<br/><br/>Can someone please hunt Jon down and force him to accept your donated server space to generate the full website on? As one of the few people we have that can produce a good looking and functional website, we really should be giving him more technical/infrastructure backup.<br/><br/><a href="http://faq.perl.org/">http://faq.perl.org/</a> is fucking horrible and looks like the kind of Windows 3.1 post-install help pages that were being generated in 1993.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org">http://www.nntp.perl.org</a> is sparse, but functional, although it could do with someone giving it a little chrome.<br/><br/>And of course, nobody has any idea that it exists. Partly because we also have <a href="http://lists.cpan.org/">http://lists.cpan.org/</a> which is a second website for the same mailing lists. No, I don't understand the difference between the two either.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.theperlreview.com/">http://www.theperlreview.com/</a> is fine, but someone needs to have a talk to Brian about some of those yellow-on-white mouseovers.<br/><br/><a href="http://perlcast.com/">http://perlcast.com/</a> is mostly ok, but as it mentions on the front page has been podfading a bit, and doesn't release on a regular schedule that people can anticipate.<br/><br/><a href="http://perlmonks.org/">http://perlmonks.org/</a> is crufty and could use some CSS attention. But it is a great community and does seem to have made something positive out of the cruftyness. After all, monks themselves are pretty crufty. Of course, I still find the chatterbox weird and hard to use, and if I can't use it as an semi-regular visitor how is any casual arrival going to use it.<br/><br/>Apart from the ugly perl.org chrome <a href="http://planet.perl.org/">http://planet.perl.org/</a> actually does a really good job of aggregation. I have a small question about why Plagger wasn't good enough to run our Planet website, but that's a secondary issue and something I guess I'll take up with Miyagawa one day.<br/><br/>And of course there's the <a href="http://use.perl.org/">http://use.perl.org/</a> debacle. It's now mostly a news site without much news, hosting a highly valuable set of blogs that can't do images, syndicate to the blog aggregation services, support trackbacks or do any other normal bloggy things that help get our message out into the wider community.<br/><br/>Given the astonishingly large amount of blog software that is written in Perl, I find it astonishing that no Perl blogging companies, and no Perl blog system authors have managed to find the time to make a best-of-breed blog.perl.org.<br/><br/>I suspect that if we had such a thing, most of the people still on use.perl.org (including me) would move over to it pretty much overnight, and then use.perl.org can go back to what appears to be it's real purpose, being pudge's private beta testing website for slashdot.<br/><br/><a href="https://donate.perlfoundation.org/">https://donate.perlfoundation.org/</a> is also another ugly website, and doesn't contain anything on it that actually tries to convince me to give anyone any money. <br/><br/>The Perl Foundation's website is just as horrible, although there's another bitter irony here that when the Perl Foundation News section basically failed, they created a "blog" (called <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/">http://news.perlfoundation.org/</a>) which is really a news page, and it's far far prettier and usable than the actual Perl Foundation website (although it's still fairly plain and ordinary by normal standards).<br/><br/>If we look at the CPAN websites, things are just as bad. <a href="http://www.cpantesters.org/">http://www.cpantesters.org/</a> has been improving in leaps and bounds functionally but the look is horrible... except for its wiki at <a href="http://wiki.cpantesters.org/">http://wiki.cpantesters.org/</a> which looks pretty good, but is really mostly for internal consumption by a small number of people. And the statistics website is yet another ugly perl.org clone.<br/><br/>The CPANTS website is also horrible. The name CPAN Testing Service remains annoyingly and confusingly similar to CPAN Testers and badly needs rebranding. Perhaps "CPAN QA"? (but keep "Kwalitee for the name of the metric).<br/><br/>And did you even know that the CPAN had a bookmark database? <a href="http://bookmarks.cpan.org/">http://bookmarks.cpan.org/</a> is another practically useless directory, but this one is so bad we could live with it just dying outright. It's link to perl.com doesn't even point to a valid page.<br/><br/><a href="http://svn.perl.org/">http://svn.perl.org/</a> is so simple, trivial and ugly that even my personal repository at <a href="http://svn.ali.as/">http://svn.ali.as/</a>, which I <b>INTENTIONALLY</b> made ultra small and ugly so it would work on my crippled mobile phone browser, looks good by comparison. What does it say when someone trying to look ugly can end up far better looking and functional than the official Perl subversion repository.<br/><br/>And hey, at least my list of modules doesn't throw Python exceptions <a href="http://svn.perl.org/viewvc/modules/">like the svn.perl.org one does</a>.<br/><br/>I could keep going (I probably should have stopped long ago) and I'm not even going to bother talking about technical beauty yet in this post.<br/><br/>What's it going to take to fix this crap?<br/><br/>Do we need a dedicated website group who can start taking over the crap and come up with a standard website design that doesn't look a decade out of date?<br/><br/>Do I need to start taking over these websites and moving them into my repository? I already have a collection of <a href="http://svn.ali.as/cpan/websites/">six simple websites</a> that anyone with commit to my repository can edit, and they are automatically synchronised from SVN to the web server. Should I just start sucking in all the small websites? <br/><br/>Could I just take over perl.org and all those bits and pieces websites and act as a steward in the same manner I've done for abandoned toolchain modules and (most recently) DBD::SQLite?<br/><br/>Would a Vertical Metre of Beer competition for a new look and feel for all of the Perl/CPAN websites be useful?<br/><br/>And for god sake, can someone with a spare thousand bucks leftover from a YAPC PLEASE organise legitimate crypto certificates for the SSL websites? This whole self-signed certificate crap makes us look like incompetent amateurs (when we are supposed to actually be competent amateurs)

<h2>The right thing to do...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sri/">sri</a> on 2009-04-22T06:44:30</h3>
...would be to get a professional designer to create a real logo and a site template, imo this is long overdue.<br>
And by professional designer i mean someone prominent, like Jon Hicks.

<h3><a href="/user/Denny/">Denny</a> on 2009-04-22T11:40:22</h3>
<p>A proposed redesign for use.perl.org, created by Andy Wardley the last time this discussion happened:
<br> <a href="http://wardley.org/use.perl.org/test.html" title="wardley.org">http://wardley.org/use.perl.org/test.html</a wardley.org>
</p><p>A few different people tried to contact pudge with no response, so plans/hopes to improve the looks of use.perl were abandoned.
</p><p>Trying to do something useful with the wave of enthusiasm for Perl websitey things, at Digital Craftsmen we built this:
<br> <a href="http://perlisalive.com/" title="perlisalive.com">http://perlisalive.com/</a perlisalive.com>
</p><p>Which obviously uses a modified version of Andy's design.  Meanwhile, Andy was working on a redesign of the London.pm website:
<br> <a href="http://london.pm.org/" title="pm.org">http://london.pm.org/</a pm.org>
</p><p>Which also has the 'glass onion' theme/style going on.
</p><p>Back at Digital Craftsmen, we started looking at adapting the first design for use on www.perl.org instead:
<br> <a href="http://digitalcraftsmen.net/perl.org/slice.png" title="digitalcraftsmen.net">http://digitalcraftsmen.net/perl.org/slice.png</a digitalcraftsmen.net>
</p><p>Unfortunately after discovering that we'd need an Apache 1.3 environment to host the combust CMS that perl.org runs on, we lost momentum on implementation of that idea.  It'd be nice to pick it up again, but currently client work takes priority.  As mentioned previously, it's also a bit tricky to find an entire spare server so that we can downgrade it enough that it will run combust - an example of how the technology used on the back-end can sometimes influence the availability of design/implementation efforts for the front-end.
</p><p>So...  there have been some efforts recently to try to generate a 'suite' of sites with a co-ordinated look-and-feel, but not a great deal of concrete progress, particularly where the core sites are involved.  If there's a willingness to make more progress now, then people will probably step up to do the work.
</p><p>As a footnote, last I heard dev.perl.org was very open to suggestions and help in improving the look and feel of that site, so that might be a good staging ground for any improvements eventually intended for www.perl.org

<p>It's nice to see that <b>somebody</b> has been trying to do something.</p><p>I suspect, however, that we might need to be one step more abstracted from where your examples are.</p><p>I've been part of two site redesigns of this kind, the Cisco design they used on all their sites during most of the 2000s, and a smaller more recent one at my current employer.</p><p>The first phase almost never results in a useful website and often not any useful prototypes either, it's a look and feel process.</p><p>The result is usually separate CSS and HTML fragments that describe the font/headings/content, others for headline page headers, alternate low-height headers, "site network" headers, menu options, footers, and so on.</p><p>This catalogue of look and feel assets then get handed off to the actual developers. In the extreme case (the Cisco example here) there's going to be multiple dozens of different websites running in different languages, run by disparate groups, on different platforms.</p><p>Done properly, the look and feel catalogue provides enough bits and pieces so that each separately operated website can achieve a similar look that appears to be part of a cohesive whole, even those they are implemented differently.</p><p>With somewhere between 20-30 Perl websites that would need to be converted, I can't see that it's feasible for us to approach it any other way. Targeting specific websites for individual design attention seems like it could only have a limited effect.</p>

<p>Most of Andy's changes were meaningless cosmetic changes, and I simply don't care about that, and don't have the time to give to shepherding through things that to me are unimportant.  I have too many actually important things to ignore!  I know a lot of you care deeply about how shiny a web page is.  I am not one of these people.  I don't apologize for it, and I find it odd that your perception of the site would be so drastically impacted by that.</p><p>As to the lack of news that Alias mentioned, I've many times offered to allow people to post news, and sometimes I get a response, and usually I don't.  If anyone else would like to post news, let me know.</p><p>As to Alias' other complaints, I see no value whatsoever in trackbacks, and I maintain the syndicating content TO aggregation services is wrongheaded.</p><p>I also don't care about images in journals myself, but we have support for that now and am willing to allow it; this can be discussed (though perhaps in a different context than this).  Might take a wee bit of work, because actually, use.perl.org is not much of a testbed for Slashdot anymore, as we now have other internal systems for testing, and use.perl.org's code has not been updated for a few months now.</p>

<p>If someone had the time and inclination to apply some of those visual changes here, would you be willing to give access to do so?  (I realize that your "I don't care about those things" means that you aren't likely to work on them.  I'd just like to know if that means you're opposed to them.)</p>

<p>Perhaps.  As noted, right now the code on this site is a bit behind.  I am planning on updating it soon, within the next few weeks.  I would be open to pure CSS+images changes.  Unlikely I'll be too interested in code/HTML changes, as those tend to take up a lot of time, but you never know.</p>

<p>Nope, you've confirmed I was right all along.  You were not, in fact, criticizing me.  You were trying to, but you did not.  You think it is a criticism of me that I don't care about such things.  It's not.  You think that the fact that I don't care about such things means I "have my head up my ass."  You are wrong.</p><p>I could, of course, say the exact same thing to you, from my perspective: anyone who thinks a "shiny" web page makes a lick of difference, and actually cares about such things, has his head up his ass.  Ho ho, look how clever I am!  But as with your statement, I could not substantiate such a stupid claim.  Matters of opinion about the importance of aesthetics are not worthy of such inane insults.</p><p>It's odd to me that anyone thinks their opinion should be reflected by me, or that I have a significant obligation to the "community" to care.  I set up this site and invited people to it, and they used it and it was good.  I don't owe anyone anything, and I will not feel compelled to care about something just because you want me to.  I have a very busy life, and I refuse -- in any aspect of it -- to be bullied into caring about something I am not prone to care about on my own.</p><p>Like I said, it's very odd to me.  Regardless, I still don't care meanigless cosmetic changes, and unless you can give me a rational reason to do so -- fat chance there -- my feelings about it are not going to change.</p>

<h2>CPAN Testers Family</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barbie/">barbie</a> on 2009-04-22T07:25:40</h3>
<p>I whole heartedly agree that the websites for the CPAN Testers family has been in need of a complete overhaul for sometime. I have asked occasionally of designers I know for some ideas, but so far nothing has stood out. The Wiki was my rework of an <a href="http://www.oswd.org/" title="oswd.org">OSWD</a oswd.org> template, which originally was intended to be the first branding of the CPAN Testers websites, with the others using the same layout, but different colours. However, I didn't think it suited the other sites.</p><p>The current CPAN Testers Reports site makes use of the YUI style, which I also copied for the Preferences website. However, with the way CPAN &amp; reporting has gone, the YUI design often makes life difficult. So far I haven't found a suitable alternative, but if any designers out there have any suggestions I'd be delighted to hear from them<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I think you're missing the point. Adam is talking about presentation and layout design, not a CMS or whether we're using a flavour of the month framework. Templates and CSS can be integrated into any site. Ruby on Rails largely got peoples attention because the initial websites looked well designed, and had nothing to do with the backend codebase.</p><p>The problem is that many of us are decent coders, and can put together a functional site pretty well.

<p>The main reason Digital Craftmen didn't manage a full implementation of our proposed glossy design for www.perl.org is that combust (the perl.org CMS) requires apache 1.3 and mod_perl 1 to run...  we don't have any servers that out of date, and we couldn't spare one to downgrade for the build and test.

To be honest, I also really don't see a problem with starting from scratch to set up a more friendly www.perl.org with a modern CMS and/or backend framework. If the backend holds back any new development, it's time for a change. But guessing from other posts this is not gonna happen in the near future<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... In any case, there's way too much information on perl.org ATM which is only remotely useful. That's why I think the main emphasis should be put into some conceptual work to restructure the whole thing and make it more appealing to new users because the veterans already know where to get the information they need.

I think there's just a general feeling of caution amongst experienced developers about 'changing the cms' being the first response to any issue with a website.  We all like playing with new technology, but sometimes all that's really required is to put some effort into coercing the old technology to behave better.

I'd start from scratch and design a new perl.org primarily targeting new users with the usual "Getting started", "Download", "Documentation", "Community" and so on sections. From there we can always link into the guts of the old (content-heavy) sites.

Contributing and building upon Perl-Begin is very easy because the sources are available in a publicly-accessible Subversion repository, and the licence is CC-by. As far as I know, the sources for all the perl.org are not publicly available, and I don't know what their licensing terms are.

<p>A very well written article. But what has Python got to do with it? Yes, "Beautiful is better than ugly." but "Form follows function." and "A witty saying proves nothing."

If I wanted Perl tu be Python, I'd use Python.</p><p>Also, there have been lots of proposals for changes, especially to the looks of various parts of the Perl infrastructure. But the problem isn't coming up with something that looks better. The problem is migrating all the content, keeping it up-to-date, keeping it maintained. That can be awful work that nobody wants to do.</p><p>IMO the core of the Perl community is too much worked up with developing code than to care about looks. If you want $x.perl.org to look better, why not just put a big "We're looking for (designers|maintainers) for this website!" banner on top of it?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t find the default Combust template per se ugly at all. It looks simple and clean to me.</p><p>But in most cases the sidebar content serves little or no useful purpose and the organisation and typography of the main content area is terrible &#8211; aside from the fact that it&#8217;s rarely helpful to anyone but search engines. Perl.org is the worst of them all &#8211; the download button is a disaster, and I can&#8217;t see myself ever linking anyone, novice or veteran, to that site for any purpose, nor using it myself.</p><p>PS.: on an unrelated note, I can distinctly remember being very annoyed by the CPAN front page even back when I was a complete Perl neophyte &#8211; over a decade ago. And it hasn&#8217;t change a single bit since then.</p>
