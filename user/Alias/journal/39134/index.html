<p>Now that my blog is listed on the Ironman planet, Matt Trout has loaned me his chainsaw and suggested that asking for help here is likely to garner a response, because he says so.<br/><br/>So consider this an official request for assistance to help some overloaded developers fix what I consider to be the most important bug in the toolchain right now.<br/><br/>It's a bug in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Archive::Extract">Archive::Extract</a>, and it's probably not that much work, but neither Jos Boumans nor I have the free time right now to fix it.<br/><br/>The bug in question is that when <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Archive::Extract">Archive::Extract</a> uses <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Archive::Tar">Archive::Tar</a> to unroll a tarball, it uses the wrong API. Instead of using the memory-efficient streamed extraction API to roll the whole tarball out to disk directly, it instead loads the whole thing into memory and unpacks it from there.<br/><br/>It should probably use code similar to the implementation of Ivor's Archive::Tar::Streamed instead.<br/><br/><a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/ivorw/Archive-Tar-Streamed-0.03/">http://search.cpan.org/user/ivorw/Archive-Tar-Streamed-0.03/</a><br/><br/>This is a big problem because once all the memory inflation and memory copying has happened to allow this loading to, a couple of big pathological distributions on CPAN consume almost the entire 2gig memory limit of the (32-bit) process.<br/><br/>This bug is making the performance of CPAN on Win32 much worse and memory-bloaty, but worse is that it takes <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN::Mini::Visit">CPAN::Mini::Visit</a> over the process limit and crashes it, which also means that this bug is currently blocking work on the GreyPAN scanner experiments (Perl::Metrics2), the META.yml database <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?ORDB::CPANMeta">ORDB::CPANMeta</a>, the permissions-aware replacement for the rather unreliable CPANTS dependency graph (<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPANTS::Weight">CPANTS::Weight</a>, my unified <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPANDB">CPANDB</a> SQLite index, and the sorely-needed accuracy fixes for the <a href="http://ali.as/top100">Top 100</a> website.<br/><br/>Improving almost all these things require both accurate and 100% complete coverage of minicpan in order to give answers that are good enough to swap out the original first-generation implementations, and this one relatively approachable bug is preventing the ability to reliably reach 100% coverage.<br/><br/>Because this bug also disproportionately impacts Win32 and is a core module, this bug is also very important for the July release of Strawberry Perl, as well as the Perl 5.10.1 release.<br/><br/>If anyone out there has a few hours to attack this bug and fix it, your efforts will have a huge knock-on effect on the quality of many other parts of the CPAN ecosystem.<br/><br/>If you are able to help us out, you can find Jos (kane), myself (Alias), or other that can point you in the right direction in #toolchain on irc.perl.org.<br/><br/></p>

<p>I don't do IRC, so I'm asking here instead. Besides, I gather that this
will be interesting information, for other people who are interested in this project.</p><p>How do you propose we fix this?</p><ul>
<li> <p>Use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Archive::Tar::Streamed" title="cpan.org">Archive::Tar::Streamed</a cpan.org>. This can be done by changing the code in CPAN.pm.</p></li><li> <p>Don't use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Archive::Tar::Streamed" title="cpan.org">Archive::Tar::Streamed</a cpan.org>, but instead, incorporate its code into CPAN.pm.
(The module code is quite short.)</p></li><li> <p>Modify <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Archive::Tar" title="cpan.org">Archive::Tar</a cpan.org> so it includes the functionality of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Archive::Tar::Streamed" title="cpan.org">Archive::Tar::Streamed</a cpan.org> </p></li><li> <p>Fix <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Archive::Tar" title="cpan.org">Archive::Tar</a cpan.org> so it <em>transparently</em> includes the desired functionality:
so when it extracts the files, it simply copies the bytes from the original tar archive
to the new file, and they never get fully loaded into memory.</p><p>CPAN.pm could remain unchanged if this is the default in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Archive::Tar" title="cpan.org">Archive::Tar</a cpan.org>,
which I prefer, or if the default behaviour in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Archive::Tar" title="cpan.org">Archive::Tar</a cpan.org> remains
unchanged (for backward compatibility), simply add a new option flag in the
parameters in some method call, so it avoids loading the entire archive into
memory.</p></li></ul><p>I personally prefer the latter.</p>

<p>Archive::Tar itself ALREADY contains the required functionality according to Jos, in the -&gt;iter interface.</p><p>What's missing is that Archive::Extract isn't actually using the streaming API, it's using the in-memory API.</p><p>So Archive::Extract needs to recognise when the Archive::Tar version is high enough to support -&gt;iter and then preferentially use that.</p>

<p>Urm, yeah, apparently I succeeded in skipping over one of the modules: <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Archive::Extract" title="cpan.org">Archive::Extract</a cpan.org>: I immediately forgot about it after I read your post, likely because I think I wouldn't have done it that way.</p><p>Well, anyway, it's clear now what you expect to be done.</p>

Hi, I posted a patch in #toolchain that integrates Archive::Tar-&gt;iter with tests
