<p>Well, not the code yet. Some of the intricate problems blocking the core loop are still there, but some support modules are written and I'm closing in on the blocks.<br/><br/>What HAS appeared though is the gold master system image, which landed on the operations website last night, courtesy of Pete Krawczyk.<br/><br/><a href="http://pitatesting.net/guests/sarge-x86.img.gz> 582M<br">http://pitatesting.net/guests/sarge-x86.img.gz> 582M<br</a><br/>As the purist and most common base operating system, we've chosen to use Debian as our reference platform for PITA development. That is, we start on debian and work outwards from there in terms of operating system variability.<br/><br/>The Gold Master Image is a clean install of Debian (base + dev tools from memory) with every important Perl currently in the wild pre-installed in parallel.<br/><br/>A large part of the (perceived) problem PITA will solve is the difficulty for the layman in doing some types of comprehensive testing.<br/><br/>The gold master image, while not having any of the PITA automation installed on it, does however provide a downloadable system image (for the Qemu emulator for maximum portability) that contains every Perl that matters.<br/><br/>So now if anyone wishes to test something out specifically on, say, 5.005_03 and 5.8.0, you can download the image, test what you need to, then drop the changes. And repeat again later.<br/><br/>To create the gold master image, Pete wrote an automated installer that downloads and installs every production Perl. It deals with a couple of Perls it has to pull from odd places (5.6.0 and 5.8.0) and handles some of the installation/compilation idiosyncracies for some of the Perl versions.<br/><br/>But the gold master image contains ONLY production Perls, intentionally.<br/><br/>From here, Pete (I believe) intended to produce an additional image which will include bleadperl, and then add on a simple non-PITA iterating tester, so you can test installing your module on all the Perl installs.<br/><br/>If you have any problems with the image, visit #pita on irc.perl.org and let us know.</p>

<h2>Future images (and build tools)</h2>

The next image following this one is an image of blead plus a known set of modules, so that after a given point of time (nightly?), blead can be installed on a base system with a set of modules, and things should work correctly.  That infrastructure, in turn, will lead to being able to install a module on the 20 versions of Perl (5.004_05, 5.005_0[34], 5.6.[012], 5.8.[0-8], 5.9.[0-4]) currently installed on the Gold Master.<br/><br/>I'll be working on this at <a href="http://hackathon.info/" title="hackathon.info">the Chicago Hackathon</a hackathon.info>, if people are interested in helping push this out quicker.<br/><br/>Also, the installation scripts are <a href="http://svn.phase-n.com/svn/cpan/trunk/PITA-Setup-Perl/bin/" title="phase-n.com">in Adam's repository</a phase-n.com>, which you can use to fetch and install Perls on a non-PITA system.
