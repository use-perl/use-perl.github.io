<p>I've had a number of people asking when the new <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perl::Dist">Perl::Dist</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perl::Dist::Strawberry">Perl::Dist::Strawberry</a> will be out, so people can start rolling their own distributions.<br/><br/>I just wanted to quickly explain the delay.<br/><br/>Because of the urgency of the release of Strawberry Perl, it was built on a SVN just-barely there implementation that has a number of ugly hard-codings and hard-to-use elements, and an API that roughly hewn and not particularly clean.<br/><br/>I had to manually tweak a lot of things that should conceptually run automatically by default as well.<br/><br/>As a result, I've been spending a little time cleaning up the standard of the code itself, adding more sensible defaults and automatically deriving more information so that the Perl::Dist module won't be going out of date every few days.<br/><br/>(Every time a dual-life toolchain module gets update, Perl::Dist goes out of sync and needs updating).<br/><br/>It's also currently not possible to flexibly build one "product" on both Perl 5.8.8 and Perl 5.10.0, something which is clearly needed given 5.10.0 is a dot-zero release and has it's set of bugs.<br/><br/>I've also been trying to write some (any) documentation, so users aren't stranded in the dark.<br/><br/>The biggest lesson I learned from PPI is that just because your code does something insane, there's still no excuse for not having a usable API and good documentation. The API and doc polishing is definitely worth it.<br/><br/>So I want that resolved before too many people start playing with it.<br/><br/>This clean up work is progressing satisfactorily, and I should be done in a week or so.<br/><br/>If you are really keen (there's a few of you) and want to start working on Strawberry-derived distributions before I complete the clean up, you are welcome to use the SVN versions from <a href="http://svn.ali.as/cpan/trunk/Perl-Dist">my repository</a>.<br/><br/>I intend to keep them in a reasonably workable state, although they call it the bleading edge for a reason :)<br/><br/>Anyone that wants to contribute as well is more than welcome to a commit bit.</p>
