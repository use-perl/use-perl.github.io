<div class="span8">
<p>Inspired by Schwern's cleanup of MakeMaker, I've been doing some more cleaning up of my own CPAN bugbears.<br/><br/>Firstly, I've moved <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Process::Backgroundable">Process::Backgroundable</a>  (which lets you spawn an object out into it's own background process) out of the main <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Process">Process</a> distribution, as it doesn't work on Win32 (I think I made a bad assumption that <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?IPC::Run3">IPC::Run3</a>-based backgrounding would work everywhere).<br/><br/>This should remove the Process dependency as an obstacle for several other modules that weren't working on Win32, but didn't themselves use the object-backgroundable module.<br/><br/>Secondly, I've improved the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN::Inject">CPAN::Inject</a> module so that it can load (I think... still a bit more testing to go) the CPAN configuration information it needs both for the current CPAN configuration loading, and for the older method as well.<br/><br/>This <b>should</b> reduce the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN">CPAN</a> dependency for CPAN::Inject back to a much older pre-2000 version. This means that for most Perl distributions, installing CPAN::Inject (most likely as a dependency of things like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?pip">pip</a>) won't need to upgrade the CPAN.pm module, which often broke (because of CPAN::FirstTime-related stuff) in the process.<br/><br/>The immediate goal with all these smaller fixes is to try and get the entire dependency chain of pip to be as painless and agreeable as possible. pip is a damn handy little program, but it's currently too painful to install.<br/><br/>As for WHY I'm focusing on the dependency tree of pip in particular, it is because most of the same techniques it uses will also be used in some of the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?PITA">PITA</a> internals, and with a full timeslice available to work on PITA over the weekend, some exciting progress has been made, getting past one of the three remaining blocking issues.<br/><br/>So I'm now preparing the stuff I need for the next phase.<br/><br/>But more on PITA in my next journal entry.</p>
