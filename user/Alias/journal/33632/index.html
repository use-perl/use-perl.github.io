<p>Because I maintain a lot of file utility and installation type modules, I care quite a bit about the ability to say "delete that" and just have it Do What I Mean on any operating system.<br/><br/>So I'm the current maintainer of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?File::Remove">File::Remove</a>, which lets you do that specific task.<br/><br/>During a period that someone else was maintaining it, it also picked up "Trash" support. That is, it has a function called "trash" which lets you delete a file (recoverably) to the Mac OS X trash bin, or to the Windows recycle bin.<br/><br/>While it's a neat feature it's always been a bit icky in terms of it's dependencies. When we got Strawberry Perl working and turned out attention to the CPAN modules, one of the things that didn't install was a module needed on Windows to allow for Recycle Bin support.<br/><br/>The trash function also doesn't work on Linux...<br/><br/>I've never really had any negative feedback on this not working, it's just sort of a half-implemented crappy feature nobody used.<br/><br/>What I HAVE had occasional feedback on though, is that on Mac to install File::Remove, you also need to install Mac::Glue so that it can bind to Finder to do the Trash deletion. This installs Mac::Carbon, which is a large monolithic package that, amongst other things, spawns a calculator during testing and adds (and noisily tests) voice synthesis support.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, voice synthesis is kind of cool (although the Mac one is fairly crap) but I really don't think it should be necessary to install it in order to delete a file :)<br/><br/>So until it's done properly, the "trash" function really needs to die.<br/><br/>As a first step, I'm remove ALL the dependencies used by the trash function.<br/><br/>If you do use it, you need to add an extra dependency to your package, Task::RecycleTrash, which will make sure that the correct dependencies are installed for your operating system, and then test that the trash works.<br/><br/>Longer term, the trash functionality will probably migrate to somewhere like File::Trash or File::Recycle, although both those names have been reserved 3 months ago with null packages by prolific CPAN namespace squatter DMUEY.<br/><br/>In the mean time, now you can at least delete a file without having your Mac talk to you.<br/><br/>I'll probably also be taking a look at File::HomeDir as well in this regards, although that's a trickier case.<br/><br/>Ideally, I'd much prefer to see all the weird and strange stuff like speech recognition moved out of the core Mac::Carbon package into something seperate, so that the core Mac::Carbon is smaller and less obnoxious.
