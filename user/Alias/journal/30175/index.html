<p>I've now had <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Alias/journal/29327">my collaborative repository</a> running for 10 weeks, so I thought for the benefit of other CPAN authors moving in the same direction I'd outline some observations over this initial period.<br/><br/>----------------------------------<br/><br/>1. It takes a while to get up to speed<br/><br/>Don't expect a flood of commits, or any, for a while.<br/><br/>People's priorities vary greatly, and while they might have previously had timeslices when they first filed a bug, they might not have now. They may not WANT to use the repository at all.<br/><br/>But that's fine, because the NEXT time they have a nit, they will do it in the repository that time. And once they've made one change, they are much more likely to do it again later.<br/><br/>2. Be very clear on what committers must do<br/><br/>However you provide access, be clear about what committers are expected to do. Be clearer than you think they need, just in case.<br/><br/>3. For small stable modules, commiters should prep the next release.<br/><br/>For my repository I only give accounts to CPAN authors, so I can assume they know how dists work.<br/><br/>What seems to work best is that the commiter add their change, increment the version and update Changes themself, then just ping me to review and release.<br/><br/>This seems to minimise the amount of interaction required, and reduces the chance for mistakes.<br/><br/>4. For new unstable dists, pressure committers to actually commit.<br/><br/>For modules that AREN'T on CPAN yet, or are new and unstable, there seems to be a tendency for committers to be tentative about committing until they are completely happy with it.<br/><br/>This makes is much harder for you to follow up or help them out, and seems to slow work down as a result. I'm still dealing with this reluctance to commit early/broken code myself, so no ideas how to fix it yet.<br/><br/>I'm wondering how much svk makes this problem worse. The user commits incrementally as normal, but doesn't push it up to you until its "done"...<br/><br/>5. Big modules are all different<br/><br/>As for big projects, I suspect there won't be hard and fast rules, because they often have their own management structures you can't apply simple rules to.<br/><br/>----------------------------------<br/><br/>Your thoughts? Your experiences?</p>

<h2>SVN authentication</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ask/">ask</a> on 2006-08-03T13:12:10</h3>
<br>A simple solution would be a small CGI script using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Authen-Bitcard/" title="cpan.org">Authen::Bitcard</a cpan.org> to authenticate people and let them set a local SVN password.  (That's basically what we do for svn.perl.org).<br><br>(Most of the perl.org services uses Bitcard, so many CPAN contributors will have an account there (too)).<br><br>
