<div class="span8">
<p>When ActivePerl was first released, there was no way to install XS modules from CPAN, making CPAN almost entirely useless on Windows.<br/><br/>The solution was a good one, build a machine to generate distribution-specific binary packages out of each source package on the CPAN, and provide an installed for those instead.<br/><br/>They got remarkably good CPAN coverage initially, and the gatekeeper responsibility was one they fulfilled competently.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, things started to go a bit pear shaped during the 5.8 timeline.<br/><br/>The need to maintain binary compatibility and upgradability for PPM packages meant that bugs started to creep in that didn't have any impact on regular CPAN users.<br/><br/>For example, because PPM implements an RPM'like model (like many binary packages) of a file only being able to exist in a single binary package, it meant that the concept of dual-life modules became a problem.<br/><br/>You couldn't install an upgraded CPAN version of a module, because that would violate the integrity of the core package.<br/><br/>In 2005, this bug meant that I was unable to install the ultra-shiny <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?PPI::Tester">PPI::Tester</a> demo/debugging program on my own laptop for my OSCON PPI talk, despite the fact the code would all work just fine on Windows.<br/><br/>For the first time, the packaging system got in the way of something I wanted to do. After almost a year of trying to work to get the flaws in the PPM repository fixed, I was told that it simply wouldn't be fixed at all (for corporate/legal reasons I won't try to detail, in case I phrase it wrong).<br/><br/>This problem with weaken expanded to include anything that had an explicit dependency on a new version of Scalar::Util, recursively.<br/><br/>I had hoped that with 5.10.0 ActiveState would be able to drop the legacy issues of 5.8.0 and start fresh with near-full CPAN support.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this has not been the case.<br/><br/>In fact, it is now so bad as to no longer be of any practical value at all.<br/><br/>The key problem here is that the PPM repository engine, on Win32 at least, refuses to allow you to make a dependency on a dual-life module, shortcutting to FAIL even if 100% of tests pass for the module.<br/><br/>Test::More is one such dual-life module that the PPM repository builder will give you an automatic FAIL result for depending on.<br/><br/>If your CPAN module has a dependency on Test::More, you cannot install that module on ActivePerl out the box.<br/><br/>No Template Toolkit, no mechanize, no POE, no test modules that themselves use Test::More.<br/><br/>In fact, only 35% of CPAN remains available via the PPM repository, and from what I can see looking through the list of what's left, it's mostly the third of CPAN that has no tests or no intrinsic value.<br/><br/>You either have to switch to an unsupported PPM repository, most likely the Kobes PPM repository, or you have to install a compiler toolchain on top of ActivePerl and use CPAN directly.<br/><br/>In fact, even the Tiny modules (which generally only have a dependency on Test::More from 0.47, from an age ago) are not available via PPM despite passing all tests.<br/><br/>Looking at the list of what is available, I can't see more than 1 or 2 modules that I have ever used, and none that I use regularly.<br/><br/>Not a single one of my modules of any use whatsoever is available on ActivePerl. Just a couple of Acme modules and a couple of Test::Dummy modules.<br/><br/>The highest rate of PASS results, in fact, appears to be in the Acme:: namespace where modules are more likely to have no tests.<br/><br/>And to add insult to injury, the PASS rate on platforms OTHER THAN Windows is much much better. It's only their main platform, with 5000 downloads a day, that they cripple CPAN.<br/><br/>For the most stark example, take a look at this link.<br/><br/><a href="http://ppm.activestate.com/BuildStatus/5.10-T.html">http://ppm.activestate.com/BuildStatus/5.10-T.html</a><br/><br/>The situation is now so bad, there is NOT EVEN ONE single module beginning with the letter T that passes on the ActiveState PPM build system. None. Zero.<br/><br/>Want to use any module beginning with the letter T (other than what comes in the core)? Too bad.<br/><br/>Given T includes Test:: I have to conclude that nobody at ActiveState is actually dog-fooding their own Perl distribution by running the out-the-box Windows version any more.<br/><br/>Because the PPM repository has now become almost entirely useless.<br/><br/>I really really hope this is just a bug they can fix...</p>

<h2>Other Repositories</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barbie/">barbie</a> on 2007-12-28T09:56:22</h3>
Not sure why the ActiveState repositories are such a problem, apart from having too smaller percentage of packages in it, a consequence of which I have been using alternative repositories for several years now. <a href="http://trouchelle.com/perl/ppmrepview.pl" title="trouchelle.com">trouchelle.com</a trouchelle.com> installs all my modules with ease and they all have Test::More as a dependency.



<h2>ActiveState repository</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chorny/">chorny</a> on 2007-12-28T11:09:32</h3>
I have reported this <a href="http://bugs.activestate.com/show_bug.cgi?id=73925" title="activestate.com">bug</a activestate.com>.
They promise to resolve it "sometime around Christmas". I hope that they will also be able to build dists with Module::Build and Module::Install.



<h2>There seems to be a bug</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/speters/">speters</a> on 2007-12-29T04:02:04</h3>
<p>Looking at <a href="http://ppm.activestate.com/BuildStatus/5.10-linux/linux-5.10/Math-BigInt-GMP-1.24.txt" title="activestate.com">Math::BigInt::GMP</a activestate.com>, there seems to be a big problem.  If it can't find XSLoader, a core module, there must be some big problems with the build process.</p>
