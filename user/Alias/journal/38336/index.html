<p>Since MATTS is busy defending the world from spam (including my inbound mail at work) he hasn't had as much time to look after <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBD::SQLite">DBD::SQLite</a> as he would like.<br/><br/>Since no other primary maintainer has shown up to take it over, I've taken it over for now and moved it into my repository at <a href="http://svn.ali.as/">http://svn.ali.as/</a>.<br/><br/>Since I don't know C, but I do know how to package and test modules properly, I plan to work my through the SQLite bugs that are related to the Makefile.PL and tests, to make life easier for whoever eventually turns up to help fix the C stuff.<br/><br/>Plus a bunch of smart people have commit in my repository and they have a better opportunity to get in and fix small problems.

Darren Duncan sent a request to co-maintain to Matt on Jan 13th, that was CC'd to the DBI, RDBO, and DBIC lists (and some others).  If he's not on the list of committers, maybe you can add him?<br>

<p>IMHO it's more about who's pushing to get things moving given someone actually has commit access and is responsive, which seems to be the case now (which doesn't means i'm against more maintainers).</p><p>I've immediately prodded for my patch solving the "closing dbh with active statement handles"[0] issue and got feedback, even though it might take a bit to get it in as the patch updates the bundled sqlite version to get a new function that helps to solve the problem.</p><p>Anyway, check that your patches are up to date and talk to the right people... that's how it always worked<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>[0] <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40383" title="cpan.org">http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40383</a cpan.org></p>

<h2>Success criteria</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/siracusa/">siracusa</a> on 2009-01-28T01:46:23</h3>
FYI, the last version of DBD::SQLite to pass the Rose::DB::Object test suite was version 1.12, released in 2006.  You'll know you're at least back up to parity with three years ago once you can pass all those tests.
