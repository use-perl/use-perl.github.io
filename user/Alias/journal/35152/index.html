<p><a href="http://ali.as/download/strawberry-perl-5.10.0-beta-1.exe">http://ali.as/download/strawberry-perl-5.10.0-beta-1.exe</a><br/><br/>I'm happy to deliver the first beta for <a href="http://strawberryperl.com">Strawberry Perl</a> 5.10.0.<br/><br/>This is a complete Perl install and the CPAN environment should work perfectly, but I'd like to do a short beta cycle of a couple of days, so that by the time I release the final version I'm not the only person that has ever run it.<br/><br/>At the present time I don't expect that anyone using the beta will need to do a reinstall, the setup appears quite stable, with just a few small things at the edges not quite polished to completion.<br/><br/>Caveats for the Beta.<br/><br/>- Release may be missing some start menu links and some minor documentation.<br/><br/>- It is missing a few last-minute additional pre-bundled modules, such as libgmp.<br/><br/>- No final matching Perl::Dist::Strawberry and Task::Strawberry have been released yet.<br/><br/>- Windows Vista is not supported, although it may or may not work for you (due to a known issue with MinGW).<br/><br/>- The CPAN configuration is set to check for a local minicpan instance at C:\minicpan before using a remote CPAN mirror, this may result in slightly spammy CPAN client behaviour with some "path not found" style error messages, but will otherwise work just fine.<br/><br/>If you could reply in the comments whether or not you managed to get installation and CPAN installation of your modules working properly, and in what environment, that would be just fine for now.</p>

What's the easiet way to install this and still be able to use the 5.6.6 version? Not just in beta, but long term, I want to run both.

Damnit. Easiest...   5.8.8 version...

<p>5.10.0 installs into c:\strawberry\ and 5.8.8 installs into c:\strawberry-perl\.  So they <i>should</i> (ha!) co-exist just fine as long as you go fix up your PATH, LIB and INCLUDE environment variables.</p>

<tt>This beta tried to install to the c:\strawberry-perl directory. I got some read-only warnings from the installer, as it tried to overwrite my existing c:\strawberry-perl directory. I stopped the installer, moved the old directory out of the way, and reran the installer and let it complete.

quick note to report that uninstalling, and then reinstalling fixed the directory issue.

I am going to have to say that is a negative on c:\strawberry. I renamed c:\strawberry-perl to something else just to make sure. Sure enough installed at c:\strawberry-perl.

As another user has done, I uninstalled 5.10.0 and re-installed and ran the one-liner. Which allowed me to install PAR.

<h2>config.h timestamp in future breaks Makefile.PL</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dagolden/">dagolden</a> on 2007-12-19T18:07:12</h3>
<p>For some reason, all your file timestamps are about a day in the future and are preserved on install.  (Yay! Aren't timezones fun!) That means that Makefile.PL complains:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>Makefile out-of-date with respect to C:\strawberry\perl\lib\Config.pm C:\strawberry\perl\lib\CORE\config.h</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>This is not a problem for Build.PL and since you've configured CPAN.pm to prefer Build.PL, this only affects distributions that only have Makefile.PL.  That includes several of the dependencies of CPAN::Reporter, including your own Config::Tiny.</p>

<p>Presumably, if I wait until tomorrow the problem will go away, but I think this needs a fix or else you'll frustrate anyone who tries out a new Strawberry Perl right after you release it if they happen to be on the other side of the international date line.</p>

<p>(I suppose you could build a new release and then wait a day to release it, but what's the fun in that?!?)</p>

That explains the messages about the Makefile being rebuilt and needing to rerun dmake.

<h2>Uninstall</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Mr. Muskrat/">Mr. Muskrat</a> on 2007-12-20T16:25:51</h3>
I don't know if you know this already so here goes.  After uninstalling, the environment variables were left alone.  The ones that didn't exist before (INCLUDE and LIB come to mind) still exist.  The new paths were not removed from PATH either.



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Uninstall</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dj_goku/">dj_goku</a> on 2007-12-20T21:00:46</h3>
I noticed this too. INCLUDE/LIB would be easily disposed of but, the paths in PATH might be an issue. Would have to systematically go through the env and search for the ones were added by strawberry and remove them.



<h2>Re:Uninstall</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2007-12-20T23:52:23</h3>
I think this is a deficiency in the installer.<br><br>From what I can see there is no simple way to auto-magically remove them.<br><br>I'll investigate to see if there's some hooks into the uninstall process later.

If you can't get Inno Setup to do what you want then take a look at <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/" title="sourceforge.net">NSIS</a sourceforge.net> (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System).  They have lots of <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/" title="sourceforge.net">documentation</a sourceforge.net>, <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Category:Tutorials" title="sourceforge.net">tutorials</a sourceforge.net> and <a href="http://nsis.sourceforget.net/Category:Code_Examples" title="sourceforget.net">examples</a sourceforget.net>.  I used it in the past with someone else's NSIS script and it was a breeze to tweak the script to do what I wanted.
