<p>I've just uploaded PPI 1.117 to the CPAN.<br/><br/>This release contains a fixes for a number of things I broke in 1.116, but which did not have test cases (and so I didn't notice I had broken).<br/><br/>In particular, trivial compound statements should work again, so that something like...<br/><br/>  LABEL: {
      print "Hello World!";
  }<br/><br/>... is not seen as two statements.<br/><br/>As PPI's biggest "client" (by user count at least) I probably need to get into the habit of installing Perl::Critic on the new release to make sure it still works.<br/><br/>That said, Perl::Critic seems to still be broken with 1.117, but the failures don't look obvious, and so my hope is that the critic guys can release a new version shortly which adapts to the PPI changes/fixes, or that they'll commit more test cases I haven't covered.<br/><br/>Either way, I apologise for the short period of instability to Perl::Critic, hopefully we'll get this stuff cleaned up shortly.</p>

On behalf of all the Perl::Critic committers I say thanks, Adam.  I just committed a fix to Perl::Critic that makes it pass tests with PPI SVN head.<br><br>An anecdote: Perl parses "-t" aggressively.  Consider the following code:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 3-t();    # syntax error<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 3-test(); # Undefined subroutine &amp;main::test<br><br>PPI doesn't treat the first case the same way Perl does, but it's a syntax error so does it really matter?<br>

My standard for that is based on how stable Perl's interpretation is.<br><br>Perl's intepretation changes over time (each version has slight differences here and there). Witness how selfgol only works on a few particular versions of Perl.<br><br>PPI doesn't try to maintain bug for bug compatibility, because it simply can't. It has to be somewhat compatible with all versions.<br><br>So the general direction is that BOTH of $Perl{perl} and $Perl{PPI} trends towards $Perl{Larry}. On the way, $Perl{PPI} also tries to get as close as it can to $Perl{perl} but without compromising its compatibility to $Perl{Larry}.<br><br>In the above case, it might matter enough to make it worth it, if not in that case, then maybe in a few other cases.<br><br>It depends on if it is considered a bug or not, one could thing of the above as<br><br>3 -t scalar()<br><br>It is nonsensical, but tentatively legal in some cases.<br><br>If in doubt, I'm inclined to just leave things as they are until something comes up that matters.<br><br>

Sorry, I was unclear.  I didn't mean that "3-t();" anecdote as a criticism of PPI.  I just thought I'd mention it here as an oddity that I came across in my testing rather than ignore it.  It's just a curiosity.

And I didn't take it as a criticism, I was just pointing out I know there's lots of stuff like that, and there are certain conditions under which I fix them, even if illogical.
