<p>This is a bit informal at this point, so I'll post here rather than to jobs.perl.org.<br/><br/>I got an email today from a Perl friend in Melbourne that owns a consulting and software development business. Most of their work is done on Linux/Unix/Mac, but they get the odd request for applications to be deployable on Windows as well.<br/><br/>To quote him:<br/><br/><i>"It is browser based but starts its own local server. We have been running this under ActiveState and use PAR to bundle it up however we aren't really a Windows shop and it this proves to be a distraction to our developers."</i><br/><br/>What they are looking for is for some help taking their application and making it work properly on Strawberry, presumably also potentially including making it bundled into the installer properly. Having done this sort of thing before (for Mac at the moment) I can say that really this type of stuff is less about changing their code, and often more about fixing/taking-over CPAN modules and generally getting stuff working properly on both sides of the perl/application fence.<br/><br/>So how about it, anyone interested in being paid for work on Strawberry and friends for a while? Chase me down in irc.perl.org #win32 (preferred) or if I'm not there, mail me.</p>
