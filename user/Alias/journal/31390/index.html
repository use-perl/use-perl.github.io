<p>I've just uploaded my first devel release after taking over maintenance of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?File::Remove">File::Remove</a>.<br/><br/>This release now allows <i>remove</i> to delete read-only files within a recursive delete if the user has permissions control and can set a file back to writeable (and I've added tests for this behaviour).<br/><br/>I've also done a variety of house cleaning tasks, using File::Spec a bit better, and adding some common sense special cases, such as remove saying it has deleted a path, if the path passed to it didn't exist anyway.<br/><br/>This version should now also work on Perl versions before 5.6.<br/><br/>Since a hell of a lot of modules sit on top of File::Remove, I'd appreciate it if people could test it for me, particularly if you have exotic or unusual hardware, or really old Perl versions.<br/><br/></p>

From the documentation:
<blockquote>
<div>Removes files and directories. Directories are removed recursively like in rm -rf if the first argument is a reference to a scalar that evaluates to true. If the first arguemnt is a reference to a scalar then it is used as the value of the recursive flag. By default it's false so only pass \1 to it.</div>
</blockquote>
Lovely, a magical first value of \1. That must make for some scores of very sad maintainance programmers.
<p>
I've never used File::Remove, and after seeing this, I doubt I ever will.</p>

Indeed, I hate it... but hey it works and it's very common.<br><br>I would like to have a go at another module though at some point (although I doubt very much that will happen) that would be a safer delete.<br><br>Prescan the tree and work out if you SHOULD be able to delete it, then do it seperately.<br><br>
