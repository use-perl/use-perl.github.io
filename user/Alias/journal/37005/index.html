<p>To mark my Strawberry Perl talk at OSCON (which although somewhat lightly attended was well received) I had desperately tried to have both the new Vista-compatible July 2008 Strawberry beta, AND the second alpha release of Perl on a Stick ready for my talk.<br/><br/>Despite burning both the midnight oil AND a dozen or so CPU hours, I missed it due to an untimely flash-drive-transmitted computer virus I think I caught from an Internet Cafe in Sydney while doing some field testing of Perl-on-a-Stick and the PortableApps.com platform.<br/><br/>This was a bit sad, since with the mighty help of Jim Brandt and the TPF we had procured a 50-run limited edition flash drive, labelled with the Perl onion logo (i.e. The <b>Perl</b> logo <b>on a</b> memory </b>stick</b>). I had hoped to be able to distribute them (for a small donation to the TPF of course) during the talk.<br/><br/>No matter though, because I did manage to get the final packaging issues for this new release (which combines BOTH the July 2008 Vista-compatible Strawberry Perl AND the Perl-on-a-Stick alpha 2 code) resolved by early evening, and produced the first master zip file.<br/><br/>The result? The special new Super Schwag <b>"Perl on a Perl on a Stick Stick"</b> flash drive, featuring Perl both on the outside AND on the inside of the memory stick.<br/><br/>I believe there are around 40 left at this point, although based on initial demand just from the late evening, it looks like they are going to disappear very quickly tomorrow.<br/><br/>If you happen to be in Portland, or know someone that is, you can find them available for a donation of $15 from the Perl Foundation stand in the Expo Room at OSCON 2008. Hallway and expo-only passes are available to grt if needed I believe.<br/><br/>Based on the reaction so far, if we run out I will try to arrange a second batch to take to YAPC::EU.<br/><br/>I've also had more than one person ask me if Perl-on-a-Stick distribution could be produced targeting Mac OS X rather than Windows.<br/><br/>In principle I don't see why this couldn't be done, although worry adding this capability to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perl::Dist">Perl::Dist</a> would be quite difficult and possible MORE than double the code size.<br/><br/>But then the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Portable">Portable</a> is mostly cross platform already, and the main problem would be working out exactly HOW you would structure a complete Perl installation (including C libraries and what not) inside a directory at an arbitrary location.<br/><br/>I'm not sure a standalone installer for Mac OS X has been done before (could be wrong here though). But it does remain an excellent idea though, given the Mac density amongst the Perl glitterati.<br/><br/>Apart from pushing forwards to production releases, the only other plans I have for Perl::Dist in the short term is to try and split out the C-specific code form the Perl-specific code, with a view to creating an alternate build subclass capable of creating some sort of "Vanilla Perl 6" Win32 distribution.
