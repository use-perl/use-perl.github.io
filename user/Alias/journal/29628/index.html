<p>Well, moved into new Sydney place ok. All the hard drives survived the moved ok.<br/><br/>The new place is a totally stereotypical geek share house.<br/><br/>"Hi, come on in. So, the switch is over there, and there's wireless, but a bit weak upstairs. The two X-Boxs are over there. Oh, and we're ordering takeout"<br/><br/>Yep :)<br/><br/>Should be a great place to settle back into living in Sydney for 6 months or a year or something.<br/><br/>In CPAN news, we cracked the big 10,000 modules WAY faster than I expected, thanks to someone unleashing a dozen new Kwiki modules on the world. And thanks to everyone else that released as well.<br/><br/>In addition, I've realised that I'm going to have to change the File::HomeDir API, seeing as there are some situations where the user has nothing whatsoever that could be construed as a "home directory".<br/><br/>So all methods are going to need to change to return <i>undef</i> in this case. Note that this doesn't change the fact that File::HomeDir will -d and confirm a directory exists before returning it, it just means you are going to need to work out for everything that uses it how to deal with no-homedir situations, and this will force people into it.<br/><br/>I've filed about 15 rt.cpan.org bugs with the people that use it I can detect, so they (and you) have a couple of months before I make the actual change.<br/><br/>Hopefully there won't be too much trouble, as currently File::HomeDir just dies in the situations that have no home directory.</p>

<h2>Why undef?</h2>

How is returning undef better than dying?  It sounds like a step backward to me.  Is there a reason for that choice?<br>

A die would indicate an exception, something we <b>don't</b> expect to happen.<br><br>In fact, File::HomeDir <b>already</b> has a number of these in it. Generally, it's things like failing to find a directory where it is expecting one. If someone hacked their OS X directories to something unusual, you might see it.<br><br>However, as I push outwards to try and cover more platform and situations, I'm finding that lack of a home directory is much <b>much</b> more common than I had thought (or than the original author thought as well I suspect).<br><br>It's reached the point where I think people are going to <b>have</b> to think about dealing with it in order to have their module available to a reasonable group of platforms.<br><br>For example, if you try to install a module on OS X as root, well then there's no home directory for it, and tests are going to fail. Currently, they die, so they fail at File::HomeDir itself. Any problems further up will so far have been masked.<br><br>But in any case, not having a home directory isn't looking like an exception-to-the-rule at all.<br><br>So we have two possibilities.<br><br>1. Die and tell people that they need to care.<br>2. Return false.<br><br>If we do 1. then people will need to do something like this <b>every</b> time you call a File::HomeDir method.<br><code><br>my $home = eval { File::HomeDir-&gt;my_home; };<br>if ( $@ ) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # Trap the no homedir case, and rethrow the rest<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if ( $@ =~<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/does not have a home directory/ ) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # handle that case<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } else {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; die $@;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>}<br></code><br>If you DON'T trap the case, it dies.<br><br>That code is pretty evil. So the alternative of a "normal" false return is better.<br><br>We can't return the normal boolean false null string, because that is going to be legal as "current dir" in some expressions, or otherwise not error properly.<br><code><br>my $home = File::HomeDir-&gt;my_home;<br>my $conf = "$home/.foo";<br></code><br>IF we use a null list, then this gets broken...<br><code><br>my $conf = File::Spec-&gt;catdir(<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; File::HomeDir-&gt;my_home,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; '.foo',<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; );<br></code><br>Which leaves <i>undef</i>. It will work in boolean cases...<br><code><br>my $home = File::HomeDir-&gt;my_home<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or die "You don't have a home directory";<br></code><br>But also, it will create plentiful warnings or outright exceptions get thrown when it is used but isn't checked.<br><br>So it's mostly a case of looking out for the both the DarkPAN and people writing new code. If there is a lot of code out there that currently assumes a true return, then returning <i>undef</i> is the best combination of "induces failures" + "compact to code against" I can think of.<br><br>I'd be open to something better though
