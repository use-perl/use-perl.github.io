I could easily walk all over DBI:: and there's nothing in PAUSE to stop me.<br/><br/>BUT, if the Moose people do indeed feel that they want to be included in a comparison, well fair enough.<br/><br/>So, how does Moose::Tiny compare to Object::Tiny?<br/><br/>Well, in favour of Moose::Tiny is that it saves one additional character of typing, with an otherwise identical interface.<br/><br/>Installation: Moose::Tiny has <a href="http://cpandeps.cantrell.org.uk/?module=Moose%3A%3ATiny">a number of recursive dependencies</a> (and a few more build_requires deps not shown) with non-perfect cpan testers results (72% aggregate success installing).<br/><br/>Memory: Moose::Tiny uses 4.5 megabytes of memory. This is around 550 times larger than Object::Tiny, or a more impressive sounding 55,000% larger :)<br/><br/>Startup: Moose::Tiny takes around a second to load up on the virtual I'm currently working in. Granted that's also in the debugger, so it's WAY slower than it could be, but Object::Tiny does not take any noticable time to load, even in the same scenario.<br/><br/>That's just what I had time to test when I first saw Moose::Tiny uploaded.<br/><br/>I'm not on a computer with a working Perl atm to complete the comparison (Intarweb cafe to check mail), so I'll leave it to someone else to do the rest (accessor speed, et al) but suffice it to say Object::Tiny and Moose really ARE completely different beasts.

Well, your 1/2 right. It <i>is</i> a joke, but the author is heavily involved in the Moose community.<p><blockquote> <div><i>

You see, this is the joke we are trying to make (and with which my review is taking said joke one step further). While I understand the idea of <b>your</b><nobr> <wbr></nobr>::Tiny modules, I think it is a little excessive that you feel the need to "officiate" and judge all other<nobr> <wbr></nobr>::Tiny modules which are uploaded to the CPAN. It is just rude to step on first level namespaces, and most CPAN authors respect this. But a second level namespace (under <b>my</b> first level namespace) is my own, and should not need to stand up to <b>your</b> criteria.<p><blockquote> <div><p> <i>

First of all, have you ever <i>seen</i> a Moose? They are <b>not</b> tiny creatures at all. A full grown moose can grow to be over 3 metres (8 to 10 ft.) in length and a shoulder height of over 2 metres (5 to 7 ft.). The males can weigh 600 kg. (over 1200 pounds) and have antlers anywhere from 120 to 150 cm. across (4 to 5 ft.). So while 4.5 megs of memory may seem large to <b>you</b>, when you compare that against a half-ton animal which smells more horrible than you can possibly imagine, it's not all that much<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>
So you see, (at least in IMO) the whole joke of Moose::Tiny is that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...

<p>Well I&#8217;m not unrelated, I&#8217;ve worked on lots of pieces in the Moose world. But your assumption was right, it was a joke.

<p>Well no more annoying that finding lots of<nobr> <wbr></nobr>::Tiny stuff lying about in people&#8217;s packages that is purporting to be a smaller/faster/better solution to whatever problem they&#8217;re solving. Part of the joke is that Moose as a full MOP would loose a ton by trying to reduce it to the 80/20 rule that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>::Tiny tries for.

<p>Thank you, I will release a 0.02 release with the updated POD, and be sure to give you the proper credit. More patches welcome via RT or the standard Moose patching process.</p>

Sorry I meant "Namespaces" not packages.

<p>Well<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... except first I didn't release until I had cleared it with Stevan first. Actually I asked him if I should
release at all, and then again if  he felt that it belonged in the Moose namespace. If he'd said no, or was unsure at
any point I wouldn't have released<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... MooseX::Tiny is no better than Acme::Moose::Tiny for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial&amp;hs=aqX&amp;defl=en&amp;q=define:parody&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=glossary_definition&amp;ct=title" title="google.com">parody</a google.com> purposes.

</p><p>Second I think a case can be (and <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=07/01/29/1318231" title="perl.org">has</a perl.org> <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/chromatic/journal/32286" title="perl.org">been</a perl.org>) made that there is disagreement on the merits of the
Tiny naming scheme. Though in those cases I suppose it isn't the To be honest until I looked again just now I thought you *had* stomped on other people's project
names because the names are so similar (for example Date::Tiny<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... *especially* when Date::Tiny objects can inflate to
DateTime objects<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... tell me that isn't confusing?). But you are right they are not, I retract that spurious comment
modulo my misgivings stated here.

</p><p>Finally I have to thank you because all of this has helped immensely with my understanding of the position of Moose
relative to other things in the world. I now have benchmarks of Moose against a self-professed *fast* object builder
(thank you again<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... the benchmarks will be in the 0.0.3 aka "Bonfire Night" release), we lose horribly in object
creation (about a 200% hit<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... because of the MOP I'm sure) but don't fare too badly in accessor access (only about a
20% hit and we support method modifiers and several other decidedly non-tiny features). I also have a wonderful
example of extending Moose that is small and focused. Last as someone pointed out, we got publicity. I honestly think
that Moose::Tiny has added more than it ever could have to the Moose project as "just a joke module".</p>
