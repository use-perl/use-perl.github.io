<p>According to the <a href="http://www.thegestalt.org/simon/perl/wholecpan.html">CPAN Leaderboard</a>, apparently some time in the last couple of weeks I hit <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/adamk">150 CPAN modules</a>.<br/><br/>I think my rate of increase has most certainly slowed in the last 6 months.<br/><br/>Part of this is that I already have most of the things I need for my own daily use now, and improvements tend to be in the form of incremental improvements and various platform and robustness tweaks.<br/><br/>Part of it is also that I think I'm starting to hit the dreaded "CPAN Wall", where the maintenance load of existing modules consumes most of your available time for doing Open Source work, greatly limiting the ability to create new functionality. Ironically, it has been the creation of the Vanilla and Strawberry Perl distributions that has created a lot of the maintenance load, because now we have an effective testing platform for Win32, I am adding Win32 functionality to more things I would have otherwise ignored.<br/><br/>And finally, part of it (and hopefully an increasing part of it) is offloading maintenance of modules to other people, and the removal of deprecated modules. I managed to remove two or three modules trying to delay reaching 150, and I have some plans to go through and cull out a few more.<br/><br/>For example, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=ThreatNet&mode=all">ThreatNet</a> hasn't turned into as big a deal as I'd hoped, so the need to have the half a dozen modules so cleanly separated out into separate distributions is probably overkill. I will probably do a new release to merge them back into one or two distributions (unlike <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?PITA">PITA</a>, which is coming along nicely and makes good use of the separation of concerns you can see in the seperated distributions).<br/><br/>And things like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Archive::Zip">Archive::Zip</a> are going to be handed to Schlomi Fish just as soon as I get my home computer up and running again.<br/><br/>So hopefully it's going to be a LONG time until 200 :/<br/><br/>P.S. The title is an in-joke, I have no plans to upload it :)</p>
