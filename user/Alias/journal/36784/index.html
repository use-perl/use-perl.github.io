<p>Well, I'm now safely in New York, with 4 days to kill.<br/><br/>Because David Golden has other commitments, other than general coding there's nothing really urgent to do while I'm here, which opens op some options to just be a regular tourist (although slightly irregular).<br/><br/>So what should I do Lazyweb?<br/><br/>I mean, ask a local what's nice and you might hear about this part of town, or that part or town, where's it's ritzy, or there's artists. Or about a ferry, or a zoo, or a park, and so on.<br/><br/>But you and me Lazyweb, we've both been to a few places in our time.<br/><br/>We know that there's a big difference between things in places that you can see in most other places, and things in places you can't see in ANY other places.<br/><br/>And you know I'm not American Lazyweb, I don't necesarily care about Liberty Bells or Declarations of Stuff, or what Department of Whatever lives in which building. And while I appreciate the pain of the World Trade Centre, it's really just a building site now isn't it?<br/><br/>Empathetic? OK, not really... but then I am an Alien right? I wouldn't take visitors to my planet to see Mrs Maquarie's Chair, not when there's Kangaroo's and deadly snakes to see!<br/><br/>So apart from the obvious stuff, like the United Nations Headquarters, and maybe Times Square (for the full skyscraper effect) or the glass cube Apple Store (because I've become intrigued with this new Portable Steve Jobs Reality Distortion Field technology of theirs) and maybe Wall Street (just for the sheer economic voyeurism of the place), what else is there that I really simply HAVE to see while I'm here.<br/><br/>Things that I'll really regret not seeing later.<br/><br/>And things that arn't interesting just because it was in that movie that time, or on that episode of that show...

<h2>A few sights to see</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2008-06-26T08:18:15</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bbg.org/" title="bbg.org">Brooklyn Botanic Garden</a bbg.org> is quite nice, and not too far from Manhattan (just across the bridge). Central Park is also worth visiting, and has some nice gardens along the upper east side (near Spanish Harlem).</p><p>I've been to a bunch of art museums, including MoMA, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Guggenheim. The latter two are very close, so you could do both in one long day. The Guggenheim is also worth seeing for its interesting architecture. MoMA has the original Dali's Persistence of Memory, a staple of college dorm walls in poster form.</p><p>If you're into food, there's lots of good stuff in Chinatown, which also has the virtue of being one of the dirtiest and smelliest parts of a very dirty and smelly city<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p><p>If you're into books, check out <a href="http://www.strandbooks.com/" title="strandbooks.com">The Strand</a strandbooks.com>. But if you've been to Powell's in Portland, I'd say don't bother, Powell's is better.</p><p>I have fond memories of the Natural History Musem from when I was a kid, but I haven't been there in a long time.</p><p>I'm not sure what's playing now, but the Metropolitan Opera House and New York Philharmonic are always worthwhile, though I'm not too fond of Summer Pops type junk.</p>



<h2>sorry I can't be there</h2>

<p>I'm sorry I have to be out of town while you're visiting.  But for a suggestion for what to do, well, there's a special art project opening while you're in New York: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/01/16/2008-01-16_waterfall_art_to_splash_come_summer-1.html" title="nydailynews.com">New York City Waterfalls</a nydailynews.com>.</p>

<p>A couple of things I've really enjoyed on trips to NYC:</p> <ul> <li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_Line_(New_York)" title="wikipedia.org">Circle Line</a wikipedia.org> Cruise - a boat that travels all the way round the island of Manhattan. See bits of the city that you normally wouldn't see.</li><li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island" title="wikipedia.org">Coney Island</a wikipedia.org> - maybe it's because I grew up in a derelict seaside town, but I love Coney Island. I could spent hours wandering around there.</li> </ul>



<h2>Central Park in June</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/renodino/">renodino</a> on 2008-06-26T13:56:11</h3>
Admittedly, I haven't been to NYC in 15 years(!?!),
but when I was last there it was late June, and Central Park was fanfreakingtastic. (But I'm not the sort thats overly impressed by paintings, shows, etc. that most folks think makes NYC a BFD). The Park is just a great place to hang for a full day, checking out everything, and being a kid again.
<p>
I don't know if its still among the living, but FAO Schwartz (right outside the Park) was also a hoot. (esp. while you're mentally still entertaining your inner child).
</p><p>
I don't have much use for the rest of NY, but those 2 datapoints still bring me a smile.</p>



<h2>Tir Na Nog</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/coke/">coke</a> on 2008-06-26T17:14:03</h3>
On the (now infrequent) chances when I made it to NYC on business, I would make it a point to get a pint at Tir Na Nog.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.tirnanognyc.com/homepage.php" title="tirnanognyc.com">http://www.tirnanognyc.com/homepage.php</a tirnanognyc.com><br/><br/>4 days is almost tempting enough for me to take the train down and have one with you. =-)



<h2>I 3 NY</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Stevan/">Stevan</a> on 2008-06-26T18:19:41</h3>
<p>
Couple of random recommendations here, take them as you see fit. I am living in Connecticut (that stretch of highway between NYC and Boston), but I have lived on and off in NYC over the past 15 years.
</p>
<p>
For art, there is <b>nothing</b> better then the Met and the MOMA. If you like modern art the collection at MOMA is without equal IMO. They also have a show right now of painting by Mark Rothko and Ad Reinhart (<a href="http://moma.org/exhibitions/exhibitions.php?id=8265&amp;ref=calendar" title="moma.org">see here</a moma.org>) which looks pretty promising if you ask me. If modern art is not your thing, the Met is where to go, you can't really go wrong with it.
</p>
<p>
Go to the top of the Empire State Building at night. Now, this sounds touristy, but it is a site not to be missed. I recommend going late in the night too, there are less people. However, this is only worth it on a clear night, so watch the weather, if there is a break in the rain/clouds some evening run over and try it.
</p>
<p>
For food, I have a couple or recommendations:
</p><ul>
<li>For Mexican: <a href="http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/taco-taco/" title="nymag.com">Taco Taco</a nymag.com>
<p>
This place was right in my old neighborhood and I was a loyal customer. I suggest the Polo Loco if you like spicy stuff, its a half chicken drenched in the best sauce you will ever have. And if you are not into spicy then the burritos are a good choice too (I took nothingmuch here for his first burrito).
</p>
</li>
<li>For Chinese: <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/excellent-pork-chop-house-new-york" title="yelp.com">Excellent Pork Chop House</a yelp.com>
<p>
Okay, so $boss[1]  grew up in Chinatown and lives across the street from this place, and it is <b>awesome</b>. Don't be fooled by the "health inspector doesnt know this place exists" style decor, thats just chinatown. Order one of the noodle soups and get a side of pork chop, you won't be disappointed.
</p>
</li>
<li>For Paninis: <a href="http://www.murrayscheese.com/stores.asp" title="murrayscheese.com">Murrays Cheese Shop</a murrayscheese.com>
<p>
The one in the village is where we used to go when I worked around there. Paninis with fresh Mozzerella (and I mean <b>fresh</b>) and some of their olives, excellent lunch option.
</p> </li>
<li>For Middle Eastern: <a href="http://www.mamounsfalafel.com/" title="mamounsfalafel.com">Mamouns</a mamounsfalafel.com>
<p>
The falafels are <b>MUCH</b> better then the dried, spiced cork balls at YAPC::NA conference dinner, and the schwarma also comes highly recommended too. It is a tiny place though so I recommend getting it to go and walking up to Washington Square Park and have fun watching all the Rastas selling weed to the NYU students.
</p>
</li>
<li>For Sushi: <a href="http://newyork.citysearch.com/profile/37730416/new_york_ny/kirara_sushi.html" title="citysearch.com">Kirara</a citysearch.com>
<p>
It has been a while since i have been here, and it might be under new ownership, but the reviews look promising. When we used to  go there a couple years ago they had the best spicy tuna (the guy made his own mayonaise and everything). It is worth checking out and since it is right around the corner from Murrays and a few blocks from Mamouns you will already be in the area<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:).
</p>
</li>
<li>For "American" Fare: <a href="http://newyork.citysearch.com/profile/7087318/new_york_ny/chat_n_chew.html" title="citysearch.com">Chat and Chew</a citysearch.com>
<p>
The Mac and Cheese is really good, and some of their soups are awesome as well. It can get crowded though, so go towards the later side of lunch.
</p>
</li>
<li>For Beer: <a href="http://nymag.com/listings/bar/peculier_pub/" title="nymag.com">Peculiar Pub</a nymag.com>
<p>
As the review in the link says, it is a "museum of beer", Nuff Said.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So for books, random people watching and just walking around, I recommend "Union Square Park and south" there is tons of good stuff there and plenty of people to watch. Washington Square Park (as mentioned above) is fun and there are street performers there on the weekend, if it is nice weather is a good place to just chill out for a couple hours. As Dave said above The Strand is a great bookstore, really easy to kill a few hours wandering it. The Barnes and Noble at the north of Union Square park has a great technical book section. If you are a comic book reader, then <a href="http://www.fpnyc.com/" title="fpnyc.com">Forbidden Planet</a fpnyc.com> which is around the corner from The Strand. If you wander further south into SOHO there are plenty of art galleries, but that can be hit-or-miss so check online first.
</p>
<p>
Hmm, thats about all for now. But that should keep you occupied I think.

<h2>Go to Coney Island and ride the Cyclone</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dug/">dug</a> on 2008-06-27T16:28:25</h3>
<p>This is the last summer that Astroland, the game park at Coney Island, will be in operation.  The Cyclone is crazy.  Every time I ride it I think that it must have been mis-engineered.  The Wonder Wheel (also part of Astroland) is more sane, and lets one take in the view.  Ruby's (on the boardwalk) is a great dive bar.  I make it out to Coney at least a couple times a summer, and love it every time.</p><p>Welcome to New York!</p><p>-- Douglas</p>
