<p>In what I'm sure he meant to be a <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/dist/Object-Tiny">throwaway rhetorical question</a>, Jonathan asks:<br/><br/><quote>
> Why bother when Class::Accessor::* already does the same thing?
</quote><br/><br/><b>OH IT'S SO ON! :)</b><br/><br/>So after writing some quick benchmarks (in the examples directory of the new Object::Tiny 1.03) and doing some investigations and tweaking (stole a small trick from Class::Accessor::Fast to make my accessors slightly faster), here is the answer to Jonathan's question, from the Object::Tiny docs.<br/><br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><b><i>Why bother when Class::Accessor::* already does the same thing?</b></i><br/><br/>As a class builder, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Object::Tiny"> Object::Tiny</a> inevitably is compared to
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Class::Accessor">Class::Accessor</a> and related modules. They seem so similar, so why would
I reimplement it?<br/><br/>The answer is that for experienced developers that don't need or want
hand-holding, Object::Tiny is just outright better, faster or cheaper
on every single metric than <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Class::Accessor::Fast">Class::Accessor::Fast</a>, which
is the most comparable member of the Class::Accessor::* family.<br/><br/><b>Object::Tiny is 93% smaller than Class::Accessor::Fast</b><br/><br/>Class::Accessor::Fast requires about 125k of memory to load.<br/><br/>Object::Tiny requires about 8k of memory to load.<br/><br/><b>Object::Tiny is 75% more terse to use than Class::Accessor::Fast</b><br/><br/>Using Object::Tiny requires the least possible number of keystrokes
(short of making the actual name Object::Tiny smaller).<br/><br/>And it requires no ugly constructor methods.<br/><br/>I mean really, what sort of a method name is 'mk_ro_accessors'. That sort
of thing went out of style in the early nineties.<br/><br/>Using Class::Accessor::Fast...
<pre>
  package Foo::Bar;
  use base 'Class::Accessor::Fast';
  Foo::Bar->mk_ro_accessors(qw{ foo bar baz });
</pre>
Using Object::Tiny...
<pre>
  package Foo::Bar;
  use Object::Tiny qw{ foo bar baz };
</pre>
You might note I've been a little generous there by reusing the class
for the method call (which is how the SYNOPSIS lists it). The alternative
commonly used by a lot of people, to avoid Repeating Yourself (which is
one of those things you Don't do) is to use the longer (in this case)
and even uglier __PACKAGE__ compiler flag.<br/><br/>Further, Object::Tiny lets you pass your params in directly, without
having to wrap them in an additional HASH reference that will just be
copied ANYWAY inside the constructor.<br/><br/>Using Class::Accessor::Fast...
<pre>
  my $object = Foo::Bar->new( {
      foo => 1,
      bar => 2,
      baz => 3,
  } );
</pre>
Using Object::Tiny...
<pre>
  my $object = Foo::Bar->new(
      foo => 1,
      bar => 2,
      baz => 3,
  );
</pre>
<b>Object::Tiny constructors are 110% faster than Class::Accessor::Fast</b><br/><br/>Object::Tiny accessors are identical in speed to Class::Accessor::Fast
accessors, but Object::Tiny constructors are TWICE as fast as
Class::Accessor::Fast constructors, DESPITE C:A:Fast forcing you to pass
by reference (which is typically done for speed reasons).
<pre>
  Benchmarking constructor plus accessors...
               Rate accessor     tiny
  accessor 100949/s       --     -45%
  tiny     182382/s      81%       --
  
  Benchmarking constructor alone...
               Rate accessor     tiny
  accessor 156470/s       --     -54%
  tiny     342231/s     119%       --
  
  Benchmarking accessors alone...
             Rate     tiny accessor
  tiny     81.0/s       --      -0%
  accessor 81.0/s       0%       --
</pre>
<b>Object::Tiny pollutes your API 95% less than Class::Accessor::Fast</b><br/><br/>Object::Tiny adds two methods to your class, <i>new</i> and <i>import</i>. The
<i>new</i> constructor is so trivial you can just ignore it and use your own
if you wish, and the <i>import</i> call will shortcut and do nothing (it
is used to implement the <i>"use Object::Tiny qw{ foo bar baz };"</i>
syntax itself).<br/><br/>So if you make your own versions of either of the two methods, you can
ignore the Object::Tiny one.<br/><br/>Class::Accessor::Fast isn't quite as light, adding all sorts of useless
extra methods. Worse, it adds man of them as public methods!!!<br/><br/>Why on earth would you want to allow your users to add more accessors to the classes they are using at run-time?<br/><br/>Here's what the classes used in the benchmark end up like.
<pre>
    DB<1> use Class::Inspector
  
    DB<2> x Class::Inspector->methods('Foo_Bar_Tiny');
  0  ARRAY(0xfda780)
     0  'bar'
     1  'baz'
     2  'foo'
     3  'import'
     4  'new'
  
    DB<3> x Class::Inspector->methods('Foo_Bar_Accessor');
  0  ARRAY(0xfdb3c8)
     0  '_bar_accessor'
     1  '_baz_accessor'
     2  '_carp'
     3  '_croak'
     4  '_foo_accessor'
     5  '_mk_accessors'
     6  'accessor_name_for'
     7  'bar'
     8  'baz'
     9  'best_practice_accessor_name_for'
     10  'best_practice_mutator_name_for'
     11  'follow_best_practice'
     12  'foo'
     13  'get'
     14  'make_accessor'
     15  'make_ro_accessor'
     16  'make_wo_accessor'
     17  'mk_accessors'
     18  'mk_ro_accessors'
     19  'mk_wo_accessors'
     20  'mutator_name_for'
     21  'new'
     22  'set'
</pre>
Object::Tiny adds 2 extra methods to your class.<br/><br/>Class::Accessor adds 16 extra methods, plus one more for every accessor.<br/><br/><b>Object::Tiny doesn't have the caveats of Class::Accessor::Fast</b><br/><br/>When you call <i>use Object::Tiny qw{ foo bar baz }</i> it isn't treated as some
sort of complete specification for the class, it's just a list of accessors
you want made for you.<br/><br/>So if you want to customize <i>foo</i> you don't need to get into contortions with
"pure" base classes or calling alternate internal methods. Just make your own
<i>foo</i> method and remove <i>foo</i> from the list passed to the <i>use</i> call.<br/><br/><b>Object::Tiny is more back-compatible than Class::Accessor::Fast</b><br/><br/>Class::Accessor::Fast has a minimum Perl dependency of 5.005002.<br/><br/>Object::Tiny has a minimum Perl dependency of 5.004.<br/><br/><b>Object::Tiny has no module dependencies whatsoever</b><br/><br/>Object::Tiny does not load ANYTHING at all outside of it's own single .pm file.<br/><br/>So Object::Tiny will never get confused in odd situations due to old or weird
versions of other modules (Class::Accessor::Fast has a dependency on base.pm,
which has some caveats of it's own).<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>So yes, Object::Tiny kicks Class::Accessor's ass all over the interpreter.<br/><br/>Now personally, the question <b>I</b> think is more relvant is...<br/><br/>> If all you want is a bunch of simple accessors, why use a helper class at all?<br/><br/>The answer for me is convenience. And that's why Object::Tiny exists, for times when I'm lazy and in a hurry, and I just want to press less buttons to get the same thing as I would have typed anyway.<br/><br/>And for me, Class::Accessor doesn't deliver on that need.</p>
