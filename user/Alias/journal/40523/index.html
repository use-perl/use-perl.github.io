<p>Module::Install has been through a long period of gradual stability over the last year, without any really dramatic improvements to the grammar or APIs.<br/><br/>With the more urgent "it doesn't work with blah" stuff mostly solved now, one of the big remaining issues is around error clarity and excessive magic.<br/><br/>For example, some random author that is trying to checkout a Catalyst project needs:<br/><br/>1. To have Module::Install installed.
2. To have Module::Install::Catalyst installed.<br/><br/>In the case of the former, you get the semi-cryptic but at least standard "Can't find inc/Module/Install.pm in @INC" message, so the error is resolvable.<br/><br/>But in the latter case, you're likely to get something like "Unknown command 'catalyst_ignore'", with no real obvious resolution mechanism.<br/><br/>I think this idea of automatic plugin discovery is starting to hit it's limits in terms of clarity.<br/><br/>And so I'd like to do something counter to my natural instincts here, and make M:I more verbose.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of something like the following for explicitly declaring the use of a non-core Module::Install extension.
<pre>
use inc::Module::Install qw{ Catalyst XSUtil };
</pre>
This would both allow M:I to error with a much more meaningful error when you don't have a plugin, and also prevent the loading of unused plugins which should prevent accidental plugin collisions (some of which I've seen occurring in the CPAN Testers machines).<br/><br/>Thoughts?</p>

<p>I'm not a big fan of MI, and I think the main reason is it's too freaking magical. This "feature" is a perfect example of magic gone bad. It adds a _tiny_ bit of convenience (arguably less than tiny) while adding significant headaches for those who don't understand WTF is going on.</p>

I agree in full.  It's like, "Here, let's declare our deps in this file, except for the secret ones that we assume!"

I personally have been annoyed when I go to work on a project and when I try to run the Makefile.PL for the purposed of getting dependencies installed (either via "make installdeps" or cpanm --installdeps<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.) I get a list of 'pre dependencies', mostly stuff to get Module::Install bootstrapped.  I know there's 'config_requires' but this doesn't seem to help with the problem.  Typically I solve it with a hack, when I create a new local::lib for a project I preload most of the common Module::Install plugins I use (via Task::BeLike::JJNAPIORK) and just tell contributors to preload that module before doing "perl Makefile.PL", but that feels too much like a hack, although its only a single extra step.<br/><br/>It would be really nice if I could do something like "perl Makefile.PL --list_plugins | cpanm" or even "perl Makefile.PL --bootstrap_author_modules" or similar.<br/><br/>On the other hand, perhaps moving toward using Fatpacker, where the Makefile.PL get generated via an authorside build script, similarly to the way App::cpanminus works, might be a more simply solution (athough that would probably get ugly with plugins like Module::Install::Catalyst, since that's part of the Catalyst::Devel package, which depends on Catalyst, and you'd end up Fatpacking a ton of stuff... Maybe Module::Install::Catalyst could be busted out of Catalyst::Devel?)<br/><br/>I'm not sure which is the best option, but I do know it would be awesome if I could tell someone all they need to do to get started is clone my repo and do "cpanm --installdeps<nobr> <wbr></nobr>." or similar and it just works without having to do some preparation.



<h2>I think so</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dwc/">dwc</a> on 2010-09-06T14:57:52</h3>
If only because it would make <a href="http://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus/blob/master/plugins/module_install_extensions" title="github.com">stuff like this</a github.com> unnecessary.



<h2>Please do!</h2>

I really dislike this particular MI magic. Even for experts it can be a pain to guess what the right Module::Install plugin to install.



<h2>&quot;excessive magic&quot; :)</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/DiamondInTheRough/">DiamondInTheRough</a> on 2010-09-07T04:06:47</h3>
<p>Yes, agreed...</p><p>And a command-line option that lists the plugins for installing via cpanm would be great, too!</p>
