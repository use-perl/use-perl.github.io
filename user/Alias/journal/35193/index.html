<p><a href="http://strawberryperl.com/download/strawberry-perl-5.10.0-final.exe">http://strawberryperl.com/download/strawberry-perl-5.10.0-final.exe</a><br/><br/>After over a year since the last release, it is with equal parts of pride and relief that I present <a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl 5.10</a>, the next major release of the <a href="http://vanillaperl.com/">Vanilla Perl Project</a>'s flagship Perl distribution.<br/><br/>This release represents the beginning of the third generation of release code.<br/><br/>The first generation was a simple build script, and was used to create the original Vanilla Perl distribution.<br/><br/>The second generation moved from a simple script to a config-driven model with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perl::Dist::Builder">Perl::Dist::Builder</a>, and gave us the original Strawberry Perl.<br/><br/>The new <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perl::Dist::Inno">Perl::Dist::Inno</a> takes this beyond simple configuration and provides a complete object heirachy for modelling and compiling Win32 Perl distributions.<br/><br/>So now not only can you replicate Strawberry Perl yourself, you can literally sub-class Strawberry Perl and build your own custom distributions in as little as 10 lines of code.<br/><br/>This release also sees more attention paid to Strawberry Perl's CPAN capabilities, and in particular to its out-of-the-box functionality.<br/><br/>The new CPAN client setup is completely zero-configuration, with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN::SQLite">CPAN::SQLite</a> pre-installed for reduced memory consumption and a <a href="http://cpan.strawberryperl.com/">http://cpan.strawberryperl.com/</a> redirector, so that we can keep zero-conf users pointing at a good default repository and collect statistics on the CPAN modules that Win32 users care about the most.<br/><br/>We've also added some little touches like a pointing the "Strawberry Perl Website" link that goes to a release-specific page, so we can update with errata and so on.<br/><br/>On the module side things remain much the same. We retain the previous model of bundling a large number of toolchain and CPAN-related modules, but don't bundle modules that add general functionality.<br/><br/>For people that would like more modules pre-installed, stay tuned for information on the long-awaited "Chocolate Perl" distribution.<br/><br/>Errata:<br/><br/>While the new releases is stable and very usable, it lacks in a few areas we will be addressing in the next release cycle.<br/><br/>1. Relocation<br/><br/>The new "relocatable" magic for Perl 5.10 is implemented as an optional Configure parameter. Win32 Perl releases do NOT, unfortunately, use Configure.<br/><br/>As such, relocation will not be available in this release cycle of Strawberry Perl. I hope to investigate workarounds for this problem at a later date.<br/><br/>2. Windows Vista<br/><br/>The MinGW compiler system has known problems on Vista with the current directory setup, and as such Strawberry Perl does not support Vista at this time.<br/><br/>I have some ideas on how to fix this, but don't want to potentially burdon non-Vista users with the complications it might create.<br/><br/>So we may well see a specific Vista version released separately.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, minus those few issues, I'm very happy with the quality of the new release, and look forward to increased sleep and some time off.<br/><br/>Enjoy.
