<p>For the last three or four years I've been very interested in Economics as an area of personal learning.<br/><br/>I'd like to think I've been doing pretty well too at picking up the main areas of understanding (at least at a basic working level). For example, my current job was specifically selected for based on properties that make it both pretty well paid and practically recession-proof. It's looking increasingly like a great place to hunker down for the next year or so until this whole mini-depression thing is over.<br/><br/>But now I think I've got all the basics down and I'm running out of new ideas I find interesting. And so I'm starting to look for something new.<br/><br/>The most immediate candidate for now is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load">Cognitive Load Theory</a>. This is a convenient topic because it was pioneered in the 80s at the University of New South Wales, which I both attended and is only a kilometre or two from where I live.<br/><br/>It's also a very interesting topic in it's own right. You can see echoes of the it in areas as diverse as <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">Apple products</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?PPI::Document">good API design</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com">successful websites</a>, attempts the define the word "intuitive", the success of <a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a>, and the mixed "love it or hate it" responses I seem to get to the <a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl</a> website.<br/><br/>I'm particularly interested in it for the implications it has for software development, both of user interfaces like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Padre">Padre</a> and for the packaging and delivery of Chocolate Perl, which is intended specifically for people that don't know Perl yet (and so face a particularly high cognitive load situation as soon as they install it)</p>

<h2>Just a mee too note</h2>

This stuff fascinates me!  What I would add to the list is the second order effects of interfaces when they are used socially.  Like for example CPAN.
