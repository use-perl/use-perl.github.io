<div class="span8">
<p>Strawberry Perl is released quarterly and aimed to be available for download on the second Monday of the month (which also means Sunday afternoon in the Hawaii and the Americas)<br/><br/>This quarter, the target release date is October the 13th.<br/><br/>If anyone has any requests for new features to be integrated, please say so now.<br/><br/>Anyone responsible for a module that Strawberry bundles who wants to get new additions into the new release, now is the time to get your new production releases out so I can pick them up.<br/><br/>In the last two days, we've already seen major new releases of Module::Build and ExtUtils::MakeMaker, inching the toolchain closer to complete configure_requires support.<br/><br/>So far this release cycle, I've already flagged the addition of a zero-conf setup for CPANPLUS, so that it works out the box, and rejected any suggestions that I start adding patches to the official Perl release (even to support something as neat as Data::Alias or Module::Signature).<br/><br/>(Having spent a year battling RedHat Perl and it's patched craptasticness, there's no way that I'm patching Perl).<br/><br/>This release will also (hopefully) see the first full beta release of Portable Perl.</p>

<h2>Expat</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jplindstrom/">jplindstrom</a> on 2008-09-29T11:29:15</h3>
<p>I don't know if this is more of a Chocolate thing, but I'd really like a pony.</p><p>And by pony, I mean Expat / XML::Parser. The rationale is:<br>- general usefullness (XML)<br>- messy to install (external lib)</p><p>I believe the (general * messy) value is quite high, but I may be biased because of needing it the other week.</p>

<p>Last time I checked, XML support was the headline feature for the April release.</p><p>So it should be there already... is something not working?</p>

<p>Probably not, since I hadn't seen that. Please ignore.</p>

<h2>Portable</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/elliot/">elliot</a> on 2008-09-29T11:44:05</h3>
<p>Just more work on Portable.  Not for USB drives, but just for being able to install Strawberry wherever is appropriate for the environment it's going to run in.</p>



<h2>Build instructions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/kraai/">kraai</a> on 2008-09-29T13:04:40</h3>
I thought that you'd explained how to build Strawberry Perl in a comment here but I can't find it, so I wish that the Strawberry Perl build process was documented somewhere I could find it.

<p>Can you see anything useful in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perl::Dist" title="cpan.org">Perl::Dist</a cpan.org>.</p><p>I'll see what I can do about adding a bit more POD to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perl::Dist::Strawberry" title="cpan.org">Perl::Dist::Strawberry</a cpan.org>.</p>



<h2>Re:Build instructions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2008-09-30T09:44:04</h3>
<p>The short version, however, is this.</p><p>1. Get a Windows machine, with Perl installed somewhere other than C:\strawberry. I have a "bootperl" variant of Strawberry built specifically for that purpose.<br>2. Install Perl::Dist<br>2. Install Perl::Dist::Strawberry</p><p>Then on the command line, run</p><p>&gt; perldist Strawberry</p>

<h2>Install anywhere?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gabor/">gabor</a> on 2008-09-29T13:40:17</h3>
Does that mean one will be able to install Strawberry Perl anywhere?<br>
There were several people on #win32 recently who wanted to do just that and had to go back to ActivePerl for this.
<p>
Would it be possible to change cpan.bat and other similar files to use relative path for launching perl? That would I think make it possible to install Strawberry Perl along with ActivePerl or other versions of Perl. At least Strawberry perl will behave then nicely.
</p><p>
Would it be possible to remove the feature (aka fix the problem) that forces us to install Wx manually?</p>

<p>&gt; Does that mean one will be able to install Strawberry Perl anywhere?</p><p>No, although I'm hoping to have a "real" Portable Edition beta ready.</p><p>&gt; Would it be possible to change cpan.bat and other similar files to use relative path for launching perl?</p><p>Maaaybe, but as I understand things, it's the fault of pl2bat. If that is fixed, Strawberry will just pick up the fix automatically.</p><p>One thing I do plan to look into though is to make the various calls to things like GCC explicit paths rather than relative.</p><p>&gt; Would it be possible to remove the feature (aka fix the problem) that forces us to install Wx manually?</p><p>No. Lacking proof (by which I mean code) that the LIB/INC params passed to Makefile.PLs is wrong and can be removed, it stays.</p><p>The Makefile.PL authors should be handling INC and LIB from @ARGV.</p>

<h2>New CPAN/test stuff</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dagolden/">dagolden</a> on 2008-09-29T14:57:16</h3>
<p>Andreas has called a code freeze for CPAN.pm to get 1.93 out the door.  That's likely to happen before Oct 13, so it should automatically be picked up.</p><p>Bundle::CPAN will also pick up the new Test::Harness.</p><p>-- dagolden</p>



<h2>Add Strawberry perl version to local patch list</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dagolden/">dagolden</a> on 2008-09-29T15:04:04</h3>
<p>It would be very handy to have Strawberry add its build version to the list of local patches the way that ActiveState Perl does so that it's easier to find out which version someone is using when they report a problem or from a CPAN Testers report.  E.g. from 'perl -V':</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>Characteristics of this binary (from libperl):<br>&nbsp; Compile-time options: MULTIPLICITY PERL_DONT_CREATE_GVSV<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT PERL_IMPLICIT_SYS<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PERL_MALLOC_WRAP PL_OP_SLAB_ALLOC USE_ITHREADS<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; USE_LARGE_FILES USE_PERLIO USE_SITECUSTOMIZE<br>&nbsp; Locally applied patches:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ActivePerl Build 1002 [283697]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 32809 Load 'loadable object' with non-default file extension<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 32728 64-bit fix for Time::Local<br>&nbsp; Built under MSWin32<br>&nbsp; Compiled at Jan 10 2008 11:00:53</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>Right now, one has to work backwards from the build date, which is a bit annoying.</p><p>-- dagolden</p>

<p>I'll see what I can do...</p><p>Apart from the headline "Strawberry Perl 5.10.0.3 [svn version]" is there any format for (not having the) patches?</p><p>Does any code actually parse it? Or can I just say "No patches"</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Add Strawberry perl version to local patch list</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dagolden/">dagolden</a> on 2008-09-30T15:35:36</h3>
<p>I think it's just advisory.  As far as I know, nothing parses it.  (But I'd ask on #p5p if you want to make sure.)  But I think in Oslo, Tux said it was just whatever text you wanted.</p>

<h2>IO::Socket::SSL and Crypt::SSLeay</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gabor/">gabor</a> on 2008-09-30T17:23:31</h3>
I  have not checked them or tried to install them and have no tuits to fire up windows, but it would be great to support those.



<h2>More of MinGW</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/kryksel/">kryksel</a> on 2008-10-01T10:24:19</h3>
Or at least, please include gdb.



<h2>What is in Strawberry, what works on Strawberry?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gabor/">gabor</a> on 2008-10-01T15:45:11</h3>
I would like to see several add-ons to Strawberry Perl, both probably on the Strawberry web site:
<p>
1) <b>List of modules</b> or external libraries included in the Strawberry Perl releases. I guess it is somewhere listed on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl-Dist-Strawberry/" title="cpan.org">Perl::Dist::Strawberry</a cpan.org> but it would be nicer to have a page with list and links to sources and documentations.<br>
I guess if this info is kept in a yaml file or similar in the PDS itself then it's easy to extract and display.
</p><p>
2) <b>What can be installed</b> A list of modules that can be installed on Strawberry Perl. I think a list of all the modules that have a PASS-ing report on cpantesters would be great. So I guess  the CPAN Testers need to be able to extract the exact Perl version (including the fact it is Strawberry Perl 5.10.0.3 or whatever) from the test reports and then create a page on the CPAN Testers site.
</p><p>
3) <b>Online download stats</b>. It would be nice to have online statistics about downloads of Strawberry Perl and the modules from its CPAN mirror similar to what sourceforge has about <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/detail.php?group_id=211372&amp;ugn=parrotwin32&amp;type=prdownload&amp;mode=12months&amp;package_id=254691" title="sourceforge.net"> parrotwin32</a sourceforge.net></p>
