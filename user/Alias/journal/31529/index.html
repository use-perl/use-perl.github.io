<p>Although I had meant to do the full release of the new and improved <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?File::HomeDir">File::HomeDir</a> this weekend, I received a late complaint from Stepher Stenneker (the esteemed leader of Sydney.pm and creator of the <a href="http://stennie.org/camelpack/">Perl Camelpack</a>) that <i>"Why hadn't I implemented my_music etc on OS X, how dare I make Win32-specific features like that, and why didn't I do my_movies and my_videos as well"</i>.<br/><br/>After explaining that it wasn't my fault, but that I only had access to a Win32 desktop system at the moment, he hurumphed a little and stomped off.<br/><br/>12 hours later he was back having commited into the svn repository an implementation of my_movies and my_videos on Win32, and an implementation of as many of the media folders as possible on OS X as well. And he's pondering implementing them on Linux too.<br/><br/>And so I've now uploaded one last dev release of File::HomeDir before the final release in 24 hours or so if I don't hear anything bad.<br/><br/>There was one additional failure found by one user on Win32 due to nested dependency on Win32API::Registry, but that seems rare enough that I'm happy to go ahead with a production release and deal with it afterwards.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<p>Well, I, personally would love to see a "my_config" that is designed for users, which "my_data" is not.</p>

<p>User-editable config files on Windows shouldn't, in my opinion, be buried in "c:\Documents and Settings\username\Local Settings\Application Data\.foo".  I'd rather see it as a hidden<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.foo directory in "my_documents", which is as close to a "home" directory as Windows gets for all practical purposes for 99% of users.  </p>

<p>For me, "my_data" is fine if the application manages the config info itself and for application-specific cache files.</p>

<p>I suspect others would disagree, or I'd just hack it into the repository.  But I'd rather not go to that effort just to see it hacked back out again.</p>

User-editable config files on Windows? What're those?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

Correct, my_data is for application-managed data only, not for human-editable.<br><br>I really don't think hidden or "dot" directories are the way to go on Windows. There simple is no concept of hidden files that you should have to touch.<br><br>Hidden files should NEVER be touched by people on Win32.<br><br>Also, File::HomeDir tries very VERY hard to NOT invent new standards for things, and only use existing blessed ways of doing things.<br><br>So personally, if you want to have a user-editable config file, I guess you'd have to put it under my_documents... although on Mac I'm not sure if that's the appropriate place.<br><br>A user-editable configuration file certainly could be argued to qualify as a "document".<br><br>
