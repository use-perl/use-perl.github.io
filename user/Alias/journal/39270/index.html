<p>In taking over IPC::Run, my goal was not to make it a better module, refactor it, or otherwise dramatically improve it. I'm just trying to fix the module packaging, and get it passing tests (fixing either specific bugs, or correcting the tests).<br/><br/>I've now managed to flush out all the Windows problems, and all the bugs on platforms I can replicate.<br/><br/>Now I'm stuck, and can't make any further progress. I don't have access to the platforms on which the problems occur.<br/><br/>So I'd like to ask for any volunteers that can help fix the two big failure cases.<br/><br/>The first is a bug specifically related to Solaris. You can see details of the failure here.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2009/07/msg4535302.html">http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2009/07/msg4535302.html</a><br/><br/>The second is something related to locale, with all the current failure reports occurring on Linux machines set to the German UTF8 locale.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2009/07/msg4534455.html">http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2009/07/msg4534455.html</a>.<br/><br/>RT has bugs reported properly for the latter one, but I can't fix it.<br/><br/>What I need for both these bugs is either a patch for the code to fix the bug, or a patch for the tests if you can confirm the test is invalid.<br/><br/>Or even better, I'm happy to hand out commit rights for people to apply the fixes directly.</p>

<h2>German error messages</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mauzo/">mauzo</a> on 2009-07-11T18:45:30</h3>
Isn't the issue simply this line<blockquote><div><p> <tt>(($c &lt; 200) and ($@||'')=~ m/^Resource temporarily/) and redo;</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>in IPC::Run::IO? It's string-matching against <code>$!</code>, which is pretty stupid. Is 'Ulazno/izlazna gre&#195;&#194;&#161;ka' simply (mangled) Croatian for EAGAIN?</p>

<p>It is more pervasive than just the single spot.</p><p>Adding ||      $@ =~<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/^Ulazno\/izlazna gre/ at line 2404 of Run.pm causes the error to go away.</p><p>I think using $! in numeric context gives access to the errno value which would be portable between locales but you may need some help from IO::Pty in order to get access to that.</p>

Unfortunately you can't rely on <code>$!</code> still having the right value by the time the exception is caught. Really all those <code>croak</code>s in <code>_read</code> &amp;c. should be throwing proper exception objects which catch the (numeric) value of <code>$!</code>. I would want to switch the whole thing to use autodie, but that's quite a major change.

<h2>Croatian error messages</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/srezic/">srezic</a> on 2009-07-11T22:47:15</h3>
<p>It's Croatian, but it means "Input/output error".</p>

<h2>Set locale to C</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/srezic/">srezic</a> on 2009-07-11T22:50:38</h3>
<p>I usually workaround the IPC::Run test failure by setting the locale to C. So maybe you can just do the same in the test script, somehow, locally.</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Set locale to C</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mauzo/">mauzo</a> on 2009-07-11T23:50:29</h3>
It <i>is</i> a real error, though, not a bug in the tests. If someone uses IPC::Run in a non-C locale it will fail to work correctly: if anything, tests should be added to catch the bug. <p>Setting the locale to <code>C</code> somewhere appropriate in IPC::Run itself might be a workaround, but I've <i>no</i> idea how the stringification of <code>$!</code> reacts to changing the locale. I would expect it to be quite system-specific: here (FreeBSD) I can't get perl to give me localized error messages at all (I think the translations may simply not exist, though).
</p><p>This is why it should be checking the numeric value<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:).</p>

<h2>Possible fix to t/pty.t error on MacOSX?</h2>

Found this little thing that might interest you about one of the t/pty.t bugs.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.simplicidade.org/notes/archives/2007/01/graphviz_under.html" title="simplicidade.org">http://www.simplicidade.org/notes/archives/2007/01/graphviz_under.html</a simplicidade.org><br/><br/>It seems that the "bug" is still present in IPC-Run-0.83.<br/><br/>I don't have access to a MacOSX machine, but maybe someone else can verify if it FAILs or PASSes.

<h2>I use a Solaris VMWare image</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2009-07-13T16:50:15</h3>
<p>I had similar problems with access to machines when I was fixing Crypt::Rijndael. I realized that I had Solaris 10 media on my shelf, and set up a virtual machine in VMWare. Now I have access to it.</p><p>If you want the virtual machine we could figure out how to exchange it, but you can also get <a href="http://www.opensolaris.com/get/index.jsp" title="opensolaris.com">OpenSolaris</a opensolaris.com> on your own.</p><p>I know that the community can also chip in, but I found that model like taking your punch cards down to the operator's office and waiting for him to run your program. Even though some Solaris people did help, I could also try stuff instantly.</p>

<p>If the CPAN Testers identified the specific VM/configurations they were using to run tests, it would certainly make it easier to replicate their bugs.</p>

<p>I think we talked about this in Iceland. Wouldn't life be grand if a CPAN tester could send you a VM of the setup causing the failure!</p>

<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2009-07-14T15:37:46</h3>
<p>Forget "sending".</p><p>I want the CPAN Testers report to state the URL or UUID of the VM that was used to make it.</p><p>That way you wouldn't need to co-ordinate, you just go to some website and pull it.</p>
