<p>"During YAPC::Europe 2009 in Lisbon, Patrick Michaud, the Rakudo Compiler Pumpking, has just announced that Rakudo Star will be released in Spring 2010."<br/><br/>I'm not sure if Patrick actually used those terms, but I'd just like to remind folks that using seasons to indicate international release schedules is one of the most pointless and annoying things you can do.<br/><br/>It's much better to at least pick a month or a quarter. Summer means December/January, Autumn is meaningless since there's not really any noticeable climatic difference and the trees don't know it's Autumn (since they stay green all year round), Winter usually means mid-late May when the first snow hits the mountains and the temperate drops 10 degrees overnight, and Spring usually means October (some would say September, but until the football finals are over it doesn't really feel like it).<br/><br/>Of course, I'm sure the Rakudo Star release will slip a bit from October. But this does leave us releasing around about Christmas just as we originally said.</p>

<h2>April</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nicholas/">nicholas</a> on 2009-08-05T08:21:00</h3>
<blockquote><div><p>I'm not sure if Patrick actually used those terms</p></div></blockquote><p>IIRC <b>he</b> said April, so, as you suspected, the reporting wasn't totally accurate.</p>

<h2>Re:April and not the full Perl 6 yet</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gabor/">gabor</a> on 2009-08-05T08:26:20</h3>
and he did not say Perl 6 will be released. Just something to the meaning of a reasonably interesting version of Rakudo will be released.
<p>
He explicitly said he does not want to over promise with this version.
</p><p>
The best will be to wait a few days so he can announce it online as well, then we'll all have a better understanding on what to expect.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/jarich/">jarich</a> on 2009-08-05T08:31:12</h3>
I'm fairly sure I heard "Spring", and automatically mapped it to September (being from the wrong hemisphere).  I guess April is more impressive though.  Really I'm just happy to have a clear goal.

<p>I thought and wrote a bit about both about "spring" the background, see here: <a href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/rakudo-star-announced.html" title="perlgeek.de">http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/rakudo-star-announced.html</a perlgeek.de> (nothing official really)</p>
