<p>That commit threw out a lot of useful information. When someone comments "I don't know what this fucking function is doing when I call it", the confusion is important.</p><p>If you think that having "naughty" words is not okay in your source, fine (thanks, nanny). But please don't remove useful information just to delete the f-word.</p>

<p>Agreed.  And he was totally inconsistent.  Sometimes he'd just replace the naughty word, sometimes he'd remove the entire comment.  He even removed an entire debug line because of a naughty word.</p>

<p>
I agree with the sentiment of the committer, but I also agree that the commit has thrown out useful information.  Removing comments which at least give the reader an understanding of what's the author was thinking, just seems weird.  Rewriting them would have been fine (and is what happened for most of them).  As an example, the code goes from having the following:
</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>if (pmi == NULL) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/* Server response is *really* f*****d up,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I guess we just pretend it never happened? */<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;continue;<br>}</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>
which at least tells the reader why continue is called at that point, to being:
</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>if (pmi == NULL) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;continue;<br>}</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>
Which looks bizarre... why do we continue?  Why would pmi be NULL?
</p>

<h2>Professional, the code word of thought police</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2009-06-15T09:40:27</h3>
<p>It's really too bad that "professional" now means to most people "unoffensive". I wish people would just say "unoffensive" when that's what they mean.</p>
