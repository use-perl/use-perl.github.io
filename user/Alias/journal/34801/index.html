<p>I have no idea why rt.cpan.org remains such an utterly slow-almost-to-the-point-of-no-longer-being-useful website, but something really needs to be done about it.<br/><br/>I can't help but wonder if the Perl Grants Committee would buy Jesse a dedicated machine to run it on (I hear it's tacked onto the side of a server with a number of other things, but I could be wrong).<br/><br/>Do people think this would be a worth use of the community's money?</p>

<p>I certainly like the idea.  Many people have been frustrated by the slowness of CPAN's RT.  I don't know if the grant committee will approve it since we don't have a proposal, but it's worth a shot.</p>

For such a small organization with so little work to do, it seems that waiting for a proposal is just needless process. You can make any rules that you like, and you can awards grants how you like. Be proactive rather than reactive.<br><br>Really, shouldn't TPF be out there looking for things to improve rather than waiting for someone to make a grant proposal (which apparently are often summarily rejected just on format)? If you really want to be helping the community, you make it as easy as possible for the community you are serving.<br><br>At least, that's how I ran Perl Mongers and how I run The Perl Review and Stonehenge's <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/rock_stars/" title="stonehenge.com">Rock Star Grants</a stonehenge.com>.

<p><div class="quote">For such a small organization with so little work to do...</div>  <p>Allison does very little handling our legal issues.  The new artistic license just wrote itself.  Jim Brandt finds running the conference committee a breeze.  Ask and Robert are just laughing out how little work it takes to maintain all of our servers.  Andy just waves his hand and press releases get written for him.  I found running the grant committee so relaxing and stress free that I finally stepped down.  Kirsten just <em>looks</em> at our Web sites and the pages write and redesign themselves.  I'm sure Kurt has written a spreadsheet that simply handles all of the treasurer tasks for him.  His printer magically spits out the checks for him to sign, no thought involved.</p>

<p>And there's more.  So much more.  We're doing better at communicating this (we've gotten tons of positive feedback on our blog), but this is still one of our biggest stumbling blocks.  Since Andy handles PR for Perl, care to volunteer to join us and write up everything we do (that can be publicly discussed, that is)?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Oh, and we still need a corporate liaison.  You could volunteer for that.  I was suggested for it, but I need a break.  Oh, and I've ideas on software we need written to make some of our processes smoother<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p>

Ah, bullshit Ovid. Whine whine whine. TPF isn't an organization with volunteers all doing part-time stuff. It isn't a big foundation with millions of dollars in a full time staff responding to thousands of grant applications. You talk about a lot of things that happened in the past by people who don't need to be parts of the grant process. Why are you using that as an excuse about why the grant process can't be different?<br><br>I could volunteer for all sorts of things, but why should I? I don't need TPF to accomplish my goals. I already publish The Perl Review, give out grants through Stonehenge, helop with PAUSE, use.perl, the perlfaq, and many other things. I've already put my literal money where my mouth is.<br><br>Let's also remember that I ran Perl Mongers with roughly the same mission. I know what I'm talking about because I've been there and done that. I never whined about how much work is was though.<br><br>

I would *also* like the ability to pick a different bug tracking system to display information on search.cpan, but rt.cpan.org is intolerably slow.  Faster would be much, much better -- and possibly a second grant for other improvements.

FWIW, I've been in the process of moving my queues for {Test::,}WWW::Mechanize over to Google Code because of the slow.  Also, because I like Google Code's bug tracking facilities more than RT.

Yeah, I saw your recent post to module-authors (?).  I don't mind RT per se, but rt.cpan.org's slowness, plus some other issues*, make it a big pain.<br><br>* Some examples<br><ol><li>can't easily get a listing of all bugs for all my queues<br></li><li>can't shut off wildly-spammy email interface<br></li><li>logins are way, way too short-lived (compounds slowness)<br></li><li>public/private URL for bug makes redirection after login hateful<br></li></ol><br><br>I'd love to see these fixed.

I agree with all your points.<br><br>The public/private URL thing drives me bonkers.<br><br>At work we use RT on nearly-dedicated hardware with plenty memory, and it is still very slow.

<i>being bound to RT by default is problematic.</i>
<p>
Yeah. There are a number of distributions that maintain their own bugtrackers (which may well be integrated with source control, like Trac is). It would be advantageous to be able to specify the bugtracker location in META.yml or some other form of structured data. In fact, <a href="http://usefulinc.com/doap/" title="usefulinc.com">DOAP</a usefulinc.com> has a specific property for bugtracker URL; see <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/miyagawa/journal/34850" title="perl.org">the discussion on miyagawa's journal</a perl.org>.</p>

I'd vote for such a grant, should somebody apply for one.<br><br>Additionally, YAPC::Europe 2007 left Vienna.pm with quite a lot of money, which will go back to various Perlish things. We're currently working on the details, but the Perl community can expect some cash in the near future - and putting some of it into a faster rt.cpan.org would be a good idea!

<h3><a href="/user/jesse/">jesse</a> on 2007-10-31T15:08:05</h3>
So, the last time someone complained about rt.cpan.org's performance, I dropped in some new logging. And actually caught a bogus query that had some Serious performance implications. A quick index fixed it right up. And we've been watching the logs since then. Of the last 25,000 page loads, 95+% have rendered fully to the browser in under two seconds.<br/><br/>What I need to know (and a journal post isn't the right place for this. mail to jesse@bestpractical.com would be much better) is<br/><br/>1) What was slow. What page were you on. What did you do.
2) How slow was it?
3) When did this slowness happen.<br/><br/>The machine isn't really breaking a sweat at this point, which suggests it might be something else. We've been working with ask to move the application to a server run by perl.org in their colo facility. If it _is_ hardware and having the app run on perl.org's hardware, I'm certainly not adverse to buying another box to fix a performance issue, but I need to _see_ the problem. The scale rt.cpan.org is operating at just isn't a volume that should be giving RT pause. (Ok. The pun was horrible. I'm sorry.)<br/><br/>Are any of you folks who are interested in a faster rt.cpan willing to spend a bit of time showing me what you're seeing ?

I've been sending stuff to that address, and apart from a short period after the most recent upgrade, they fall into the bit bucket and I never know what state they are in after an initial "thanks for the message" response.<br><br>Is the queue actually visible somewhere?<br><br>

FYI, I'm following along and if it turns out that hardware is part of the problem, TPF will do what we can to fix things. As it is, it appears Jesse is on the case and has a few things to try before we buy new hardware.
