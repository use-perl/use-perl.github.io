<p>If you follow the Perl Foundation you will have read that the grants committee has been kind enough to (unexpectedly) pay me the second half of my (failed) <a href="http://news.perl-foundation.org/2007/03/adam_kennedys_refactoring_edit.html">refactoring editor grant</a> regardless of the failure, recognizing the yak shaving done to get Vanilla/Strawberry and the entire Win32 cleanup movement rolling as a suitable substitute for the original target.<br/><br/>Given that I haven't actually received the money yet, this would most certainly be a HIGHLY stupid time to criticize the Perl Foundation...<br/><br/>BUUUUUUUT :)<br/><br/>It just occurred to me reading the blog that I hadn't looked at the TPF main website in ages. So I went and had a quick look.<br/><br/>The most recent News item on the front-page dates from May 5 2006.<br/><br/>So in about 5 weeks we'll see the TPF website in the ironic position of having VASTLY improved the amount of news and information updates they provide to the public, while APPEARING to have stopped providing information to the public at all (unless you click on that little Foundation Blog link in the menu there).<br/><br/>The Law of Unintended Consequences still holds the ability to amuse.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's about time the TPF to compensate for the fact that blog == news and rejiggle things a bit :)<br/><br/>(or to decide what events separate "news" from "blog entries").<br/><br/>Late Addition:<br/><br/>And of course, I'm not entirely free from irony (and in this case hypocracy) either, having started the grant to create a refactoring Perl editor to improve the functionality of Perl editors, but in the end delivering a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?App::GUI::Notepad">pure-Perl cross-platform CPAN-installable reimplementation of Microsoft Notepad</a> :)</p>

<p>Our decision to pay you is in no way related to your comments about the Web site.  You deserve the money for your work and the fact that you're not constantly singing our praises is irrelevant.  We appreciate what you do.</p>

<p>Thanks for bringing this to our attention.  I've forwarded your comments to the TPF people who oversee the Web side of things.  I do know some work was happening there, but since I don't do anything with that side, I haven't paid attention to what's happening.</p>
