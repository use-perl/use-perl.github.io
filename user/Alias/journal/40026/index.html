<div class="span8">
<p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Devel::Declare">Devel::Declare</a> vexes me greatly.<br/><br/>On one hand, it's interesting to see the kinds of things you can do when you have the ability to temporarily take over parsing of the language.<br/><br/>On the other hand, this ability to just parse whatever the hell you want means the gradual decline in utility for the entire Perl development toolset. It's like someone has taken source filters (which everyone at least KNEW were "evil") and made them popular and "safe".<br/><br/>The real problem here is not that these problems are occurring, but they are occurring for what often seems like (or actually is) a very good reason. And as anyone who has seen my "Nothing Can Possibly Go Wrong" talk should know, the most dangerous failures are the ones we are seduced into because it seems like such a good idea.<br/><br/>For example, take this <a href="http://transfixedbutnotdead.com/2009/12/16/url-develdeclare-and-no-strings-attached/">cool implementation of URLs via Devel::Declare</a>.<br/><br/>Mixed that with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?LWP::Simple">LWP::Simple</a> and you can do things like this, that actually run.
<code>
my $content = GET http://ali.as/;
</code>
Or how about inline SQL, as featured in a couple of other languages. I'm fairly certain that by adding hooks for, say, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE I could easily make the following work.
<code>
my $arrayref_of_hashes = SELECT * FROM table_name;
</code><br/><br/>This stuff is supremely shiny, and if you're anything like me as soon as you look at it you want it badly.<br/><br/>But these features aren't free.<br/><br/>In the general case (looking at ARBITRARY modules rather than specific modules) you lose the following.<br/><br/>1. No/degraded syntax highlighting.
2. No/degraded PPI parsing.
3. No/degraded shiny Padre refactoring tools.<br/><br/>You also lose support for things like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perl::Critic">Perl::Critic</a> almost entirely. PPI's statement classifier drives a lot of critic functionality. It only exists because PPI can reliably find the ends of statements.<br/><br/>If you break the ability to find the end of a statement (as many D:D modules do to define their own block keywords like "class { }") then the parse tree starts to get really really whacky and critic will inevitably start to spit out false positives.<br/><br/>Once you start spewing false positives in enough volume, you undermine confidence in the tool and we might as well stop using it (or at least turn off entirely rule subsets).<br/><br/>There are proposals for ways to extend PPI so somehow support these new keywords (I've even agreed with Matt on how we would go about it) but I continue to suspect they don't work in the general case because you have to have installed the PPI extensions in advance, before you attempt to parse a document containing those D:D modules (or you allow arbitrary execution of user code, at which point <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Acme::BadExample">Acme::BadExample</a> will complete pwn your machine).<br/><br/>This process gradually grinds onwards. D:D gets more mature and more used, Perl 5.12 contains core enhancements that help make it work better, further legitimising the concept.<br/><br/>Each step along the way is completely rational, and completely defensible. And it all looks great in blog code snippits. To paraphrase one prominent Perl core dev <i>"Should we stop making the language better because it breaks PPI?"</i><br/><br/>And yet, at the risk of bringing down Godwin's Law on myself, I can help but see the kind of effect described in the famous poem <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came">First They Came</a>.
<blockquote>
First they came for the communists, and I did not speak outÃ¢â¬âbecause I was not a communist;
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak outÃ¢â¬âbecause I was not a trade unionist;
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak outÃ¢â¬âbecause I was not a Jew;
Then they came for meÃ¢â¬âand there was no one left to speak out for me.
</blockquote><br/><br/>The difficulty level to modify the parser and break the development tools is already starting to move from "a large effort by experts" to "check out this neat URL hack".<br/><br/>At some point, the use of D:D-style parser hacks becomes routine and normal, and people start implementing new extensions just for their one specific project. <br/><br/>And at some point the primary interface to Moose or Catalyst is using D:D or something like it, because it's SO much more elegant. And so any code written with Moose isn't compatible with Perl Critic, and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>Some time soon, before Perl turns into Smalltalk (for which there are basically NO tools at all that don't also involve running the code), I think we need to have this discussion.<br/><br/>How many useful development tools are we willing to sacrifice (making development harder) in order to make development "easier".</p>

<p>While its true DD and traditional source filters both change the source code, it is unfair to simply lump DD in with source filters.  "Source filter" is a dirty word.  DD does not share the traditional problem with source filters, that of trying to parse Perl and their global nature.  For example, a source filter might decide to alter code-like strings and regexes.  DD won't be fooled by that.  It gets around this problem by (ab)using Perl's own parser.</p><p>DD brings in its own bag of problems, but calling it a source filter seems dismissive.</p>

<p>I agree that it does not share some of the side-effects, and the level of collateral damage is greatly reduced.</p><p>But it still makes arbitrary changes to the lexical structure of the language. From a static parsing point of view, THAT is the critical problem here.</p><p>The problems with collateral damage are only a problem from the point of view of an executing parser.</p>

<h2>Actually No</h2>

<blockquote><div><p> <i>
And now the primary interface to Moose is using D:D or something like it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
</i></p></div> </blockquote><p>
Actually, MooseX::Declare is just <i>another</i> way to use Moose, but very surely <b>not</b> the primary.
</p><p>
Many people are using MooseX::Declare, and find it very nice and elegant, but many others (myself included) are not willing to use MooseX::Declare or Devel::Declare in production because it is not yet mature enough. Personally, my reasoning is that I feel it still exposes too much internals when it errors and makes for some difficult debugging.  Of course when MX::Declare no longer has these issues and is more mature, I will no doubt start using it more, but I can assure you that the primary Moose interface is still plain old Perl and will remain to be for the forseeable future.
</p><p>
For the record, I agree with you,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... although I am conflicted. On one hand I can see all the horrors that you see, I saw them (or the potential of them) in Perl 6. On the other hand, I have to agree with chromatic, the language itself cannot be a test bed for experimentation, that type of thing belongs in modules and extensions (we use the same philosophy with Moose and new feature proposals, they have to be a MooseX:: first). Devel::Declare just expands the range within which these experiments can explore. As with all of CPAN, the crap will float to the bottom and the good stuff will rise to the top and perhaps in some cases drive forward the language itself.

<blockquote><div><p> <em>I have to agree with chromatic, the language itself cannot be a test bed for experimentation....</em></p></div> </blockquote><p>I agree, but that's not my main point here.</p><p>It <em>is</em> a mistake to canonize features before they're ready, unless you have some mechanism of indicating that they may change in subsequent releases.  No one wants the chaos of frequent churn.</p><p>It's also a mistake, possibly more severe, to refuse to add features widely-requested and often reimplemented in subtly incompatible ways.</p><p>Having D::D available with core support is a good thing for experimentation.  Yet it's also risky if that reduces the possibility of adding necessary, missing features.  Part of that is, as Adam suggests, the fact of incompatibility across an ecosystem less tightly bound than the core.  Part of that is the lack of good defaults for everyone but language adepts who know the proper incantations du jour.  Part of that is that D::D can easily become a short-term safety valve to work around systemic process problems that may harm Perl 5 in the long term.</p>

<h2>Circles should be square</h2>

<p>I seem to recall something Nat said in his "What's With Those Python Fucks Anyway?" rant that "circles should be square so they're easier to draw and measure".</p><p>While I sympathize the the folks that write tools to do static analysis of Perl code, it seems rather putting the cart before the horse to restrict language development to serve those tools.  It should be the other way around.  It would be nice if we had formal Perl 6 style grammars to make life easier for the toolsmiths, but I'm not holding my breath.  Source filters and Devel::Declare are open to broad abuse, but what's remarkable is its use has been very restrained.</p>

A less panicky question would be to say if you could do without syntax highlighting and indentation, which is really all the Perl specific stuff I use.  I'd miss indentation, but syntax highlighting I can live without.</p><p>That said, its not EITHER we have tools OR we get to play with the language.  The tools have already had to reverse engineer the entire Perl 5 grammar.  If a grammar altering pragma becomes popular they can add a few more widgets.

Didn't happen with source filters, I don't see it happening with DD.  Largely what I see reaching production quality is A) real signatures and B) powerful blocks.  Stuff like bareword URLs and inline SQL can break the grammar too many ways because of their ill-defined content.</p><blockquote><div><p>    Source filters and Devel::Declare are open to broad abuse, but what's remarkable is its use has been very restrained.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... for now.</p></div></blockquote><p>DUN DUN DUUUUNNNNN!!!</p><p>Perl 5 went through its source filter craze, discovered the problems with it, recoiled, spawned Perl 6 grammars, and then largely went dormant because its unsafe.

<p>That's why D::D should only be a prototyping tool and eventually such features should be available from the core.</p><p>Note, however, that making the new syntax available with a "feature" invocation carries virtually the same problems as D::D. You never know from static analysis (and non-recursive) whether it's on or not. But at least this would mean it's blessed and to be considered part of the language.</p>

<p>Well, the difference with use feature is that at least in that case it's official, in the core, works the same on every operating system and every host, and doesn't require the parser to leave the document.</p><p>So it's possible to add the relevant special casing in, where in the generic DD case that is not true.</p>
