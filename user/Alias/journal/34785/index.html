<p>I'm currently pushing through "the grind" for the new <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perl::Dist">Perl::Dist</a> and <a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl</a> releases, running the build process over and over again, tweaking and bug-fixing as I go. I've burned about 20 hours of CPU in the last week or so.<br/><br/>I'm happy with the binary-installation phase (which sets up gcc and dmake and friends) and the Perl compilation phase (at least for 5.8.8) and I'm now into the "toolchain distributions" phase.<br/><br/>This involves fetching a pre-defined set of distributions and running "perl Makefile.PL; make; make test; make install" on them (without the ability to recursively resolve deps) to get the CPAN toolchain up to scratch.<br/><br/>The 4th phase once this works is the "CPAN module" phase, which uses the upgraded toolchain to install a variety of modules from the CPAN using CPAN.pm and friends.<br/><br/>This is the phase that most people building custom Perl installs (the cat-in-a-box concept for example) will probably want to customize, to install whatever it is they are interested in.<br/><br/>One minor problem when building dists is that the fixed paths and the fact you can't use a distribution (say, Strawberry) to build a new version of that distribution.<br/><br/>To assist with this problem, I'm going to shortly release a "Perl::Dist::Bootstrap" module, and matching .exe installer.<br/><br/>This will be a Strawberry-like distribution, but which will install to an out-of-the-way C:\bootstrap-perl location, and will come with Perl::Dist and all it's dependencies pre-installed.<br/><br/>So the final process for creating a new Vanilla Family distribution becomes:
<pre>
1. Install Windows
2. Install the Bootstrap Perl executable
3. Check out your distribution module from version control
4. Run perldist My::Distribution to create the Perl distribution
</pre><br/><br/>I am pretty close to having a first experimental release completed, and I'll be doing a dev release of both it and the new Perl::Dist code in the next few days.<br/><br/><b>Update:</b><br/><br/>It would appear that the toolchain distribution install phase is working fully now, so I'll be commiting everything and dropping some test releases.</p>
