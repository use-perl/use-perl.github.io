<p>Right. That's it. I've really just had enough with Algorithm::Dependency and it's little issues and things it doesn't support, and which can't easily be added on. I still think I designed a really great algorithm, but in turning it into a module I made a lot of stupid API decisions, and now it's embedded so deep in so many things I pretty much can't escape.<br/><br/>Extending it feels like extending Java code. There's a zillion damn classes, and all of them are tiny with dependencies all over the place.<br/><br/>Writing the adapters for JSAN was the last straw. It doesn't like working directly with objects (which resulted in Alg::Dep::Object being written by someone else) it doesn't support Sources that need to be resolved incrementally, so you have to load the entire world in advance every time.<br/><br/>Casting around for ideas, I discovered Graph.pm and finally took the time to read through it.<br/><br/>As usually, I find out that the problem I solved on a whiteboard on the loungeroom floor watching random mindless motorsports has all sorts of official terminology attached to it, like "graph theory" and "vertice" and "edge" and so on.<br/><br/>So I'm junking Alg:Dep and starting a new design. And _this_ time it's going to...<br/><br/>- Use the correct terminology
- Support objects (including anonymous ones)
- Support incremental resolution
- Support versioned dependencies
- Support vertice values (multiverticies I believe it's called)
- Be less of a pain in the arse to integrate into things like Class::DBI
- Use an API that will be much more portable to Perl 6 and work better once it's ported.<br/><br/>And so on and so forth. It's a big ask, and I'm expecting it to take about a month (ok, at _least_ a month) for a complete design to gel together in my head enough to be confident of the design.<br/><br/>Fortunately, I'm already confident about the core Alg:Dep algorithm, and it will be staying. But it's the next layer out that needs some heavy refactoring.<br/><br/>In fact, the result of a dependency call of the same system ported from Alg:Dep to whatever the new system is should be both deterministic and produce the same list in the same order. I want clean upgrades too.<br/><br/>The filling is great, I just want better buns. And this time around I'd like a plate. And maybe a coffee.<br/><br/>So, have you ever tried Alg:Dep? Have any issues, comments or problems with it? Feel free to comment.</p>

<h2>I tried it recently</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/domm/">domm</a> on 2005-09-05T18:57:36</h3>
(in fact, two days prior to YAPC::Europe). I wanted to generate dependency trees for CPANTS that showed the sum of all dists required by each dist.<br><br>I played around a bit but didn't get it working (mainly because I couldn't figure out how to build a source list from a DB - but this seems to be caused by what you call 'loading the world'). I didn't want to spend to much time on it, as I had other stuff to do (like writing slides...).<br><br>I look forward to a new release of Alg:Dep, as I definitly want to include said tree in CPANTS but am way to dumb to figure out a proper recursive dependency checker on my own (BTW, I'm still stuck somewhere in the middle of HOP...)
