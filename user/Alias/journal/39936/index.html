<p><a href="http://svn.ali.as/cpan/releases/DBD-SQLite-1.27.tar.gz">http://svn.ali.as/cpan/releases/DBD-SQLite-1.27.tar.gz</a><br/><br/>I'm happy to announce the release of DBD::SQLite 1.27, the first production release since the original sprint in March/April.<br/><br/>This is a massive release for the DBD::SQLite team. Since the last release, we've seen around 150-200 commits and 7 developer releases. All of the changes in this release can be credited to (in commit quantity order) <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/ishigaki">ISHIGAKI</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/dami">DAMI</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/duncand">DUNCAND</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/vlyon">VLYON</a>, and a larger cast of bug submitters and patch submitters, and myself merely acting as release manager and resident devil's advocate.<br/><br/>Major features include:<br/><br/>- SQLite release upgraded to 3.6.20<br/><br/>- Hugely improved test suite, and a major increase in reliability (as measured by CPAN Testers). This should allow DBD::SQLite to finally escape it's shameful position in the <a href="http://ali.as/top100">FAIL 100</a> list.<br/><br/>- Foreign key constraints are now supported and enforceable. In line with SQLite itself, we have them disabled by default. A pragma (detailed in the SQLite documentation) is used to turn them on.<br/><br/>- Huge refactoring of the internals to match DBI's preferred style, the func calls are now deprecated, replaced by first class sqlite_* methods.<br/><br/>- Online Backup support, allowing the copying of SQLite databases while they are live.<br/><br/>- SQLite includes syntactic support for an infix operator 'REGEXP'. This is now implemented using Perl regular expressions.<br/><br/>- Support for loading external sqlite3 extensions<br/><br/>- Support for fine-grained query security via sqlite_set_authorizer hooks.<br/><br/>- Support for commit, rollback and update hooks<br/><br/>While we've tried to keep compatibility wherever possible, if you do some more unusual things with SQLite you may see problems or regressions.<br/><br/>For example, my Xtract tool was using the column_info method to discover types in SQLite interfaces. The column_info method now requires an explicit schema, which broke my code.<br/><br/>In most cases, we hope that any changes you will need to make are minor and will be more correct (i.e. closer to the standard DBI usage).<br/><br/>This release is recommended for all users, and (pending a unexpected late bug) is expected to be the stable release for some time (probably until the next SQLite release they define as a recommended upgrade).</p>

<h2>Wow!</h2>

With FK support and online backup this finally makes SQLite something I can consider for more than personal or development needs.  I know lots of people have been using in for various production but without FK support I just couldn't recommend it.  Thanks to the entire team for this massive effort.
