<p>This weekend I managed to find 2 entire timeslices to concentrate on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?PITA">PITA</a>.<br/><br/>So after completely isolating myself in the office over the weekend, I have finally managed to complete the integration of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?PITA::POE::SupportServer">PITA::POE::SupportServer</a> (which is a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?POE">POE</a>-based server written by Chris Williams that launches and monitors the virtual machine in a couple of very specific ways, while simultaneously providing a web server and CPAN mirror to the virtual machine and collecting results via PUT requests) with the main Guest API (which is the API that lets you take a "guest" environment as an object, throw a testing request at it, and it does all the magic to provide you a result).<br/><br/>Some additional tidying up to make sure all the parts are in sync and I've celebrated with a complete set of module releases, at version 0.40.<br/><br/>Because this means that the PITA Core (the fundamental processing loop) is now officially "working".<br/><br/>On a side note, as part of the very thorough test suite, I've uploaded <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?PITA::Test::Image::Qemu">PITA::Test::Image::Qemu</a> to the CPAN, which I think marks the first time that anyone has uploaded an entire Linux distribution into the CPAN :)<br/><br/>(Before you freak out, it's an extremely heavily customised busybox-derived distribution, only 1.1 meg in size)<br/><br/>Now, where to next.<br/><br/>With the PITA Core working, the next phase is dealing with images and working out how to actually build a PITA Host.<br/><br/>Fortunately, in this area is MUCH more straight forward that the Bog of Virtual Machine Integration (just down the valley from the Bog of Stench) so I expect work to proceed far more quickly and at a more measured pace.<br/><br/>The first step is the Guest Storage API. This provides a mechanism to store, add, search, manage and generally look after guests. It's just a simple data storage exercise, except that in some cases the "data" consists of 2 gigabyte disk images with attached XML metadata.<br/><br/>As soon as this is working I plan to wrap the first command line application around it, so you can create a guest store, add and remove guests, and download them from remote stores, and so on.<br/><br/>Once this kind of tool for managing images in place, I'll be looking at putting together the first production-grade testing virtual machines, based on a series of excellent debian images already available from <a href="http://pitatesting.net/guests/">the pitahosting.net website</a>.
