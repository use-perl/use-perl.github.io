<p>After another series of incremental releases, I've now largely moved up from testing "TinyAuth' (my yet-to-be-properly-named ultra-minimalist SVN repository manager) only in test scripts to testing it on a real server with a real .htpasswd file using a real browser (although not for a real service yet).<br/><br/>If you are interested, feel free to point a browser, indeed ANYTHING that calls itself a "browser", at <a href="http://svn.ali.as/cgi-bin/tinyauth">http://svn.ali.as/cgi-bin/tinyauth</a>.<br/><br/>You can use the username "adamk@cpan.org" and password "foo" to login and add an account for yourself (and promote yourself to admin if you want).<br/><br/>I've also added some basic installation instructions for anyone that is interested in tinkering with an installation of their own.<br/><br/>Please note there's still more polishing, bug fixing and general getting-ready to do before the final release, so expect a few potential nigglies.</p>

I can confirm this. I tried to login now and was not able to, either.

I've reset the password to "foo", I must have changed it during testing.<br><br>Go nuts.<br>

<p>
Thanks. I was able to login to TinyAuth, create an account, receive the password by mail and promote myself to admin.
</p>

<p>
However, I cannot seem to be able to commit anything to the repository:
</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>shlomi:~/progs/perl/cpan/Archive-Zip/trunk/Archive-Zip$ svn commit -F svn-commit.tmp<br>Authentication realm: &lt;http://svn.ali.as:80&gt; The Open Repository<br>Password for 'shlomi':<br>Authentication realm: &lt;http://svn.ali.as:80&gt; The Open Repository<br>Username: shlomif@cpan.org<br>Password for 'shlomif@cpan.org':<br>Authentication realm: &lt;http://svn.ali.as:80&gt; The Open Repository<br>Username: shlomif@cpan.org<br>Password for 'shlomif@cpan.org':<br>svn: Commit failed (details follow):<br>svn: MKACTIVITY of '/cpan/!svn/act/01c8280d-61bf-4791-a907-da1dc407188a': authorization failed (http://svn.ali.as)</tt></div> </blockquote>

That is correct.<br><br>As I mentioned, the application is just for testing purposes atm, it isn't controlling the actual repository yet.<br><br>I'll do that some time down the track, just before release.

I see. Thanks.
</p>

<p>
In any case I'd like to commence work on Archive::Zip, and it would be helpful if I had a commit access to the repository.

I plan to start dog-fooding properly in the next day or so.

<h2>run method is ugly!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2007-09-28T08:44:25</h3>
<p>Your <tt>&amp;run</tt> method if/elsif/else chain is very difficult to read.  Switching to a dispatch table makes it much easier to understand.</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>my %method_for = (<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; o =&gt; 'action_logout',<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; f =&gt; 'view_forgot',<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; r =&gt; 'action_forgot',<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; c =&gt; 'view_change',<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; p =&gt; 'action_change',<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; n =&gt; 'view_new',<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; a =&gt; 'action_new',<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; l =&gt; 'view_list',<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; m =&gt; 'view_promote',<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; b =&gt; 'action_promote',<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; d =&gt; 'view_delete',<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; e =&gt; 'action_delete'<br>);<br>sub run {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $self = shift;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; if ( my $method = $method_for{ $self-&gt;action } ) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return $self-&gt;$method;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; } elsif ( $self-&gt;action eq 'error' ) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return 1;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; } else {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return $self-&gt;view_index;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>}</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>You could simplify that even more, but I figured that was a good start.</p>

I'm not sure I'd call that simpler, possibly more elegant though<br>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:run method is ugly!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2007-09-28T11:43:29</h3>
<p>It's easier to see which action maps to which method and makes it less likely to have bugs in the future as adding a new action is trivial.  You just add a new entry to the hash and don't have to worry about the code.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2007-09-28T12:00:16</h3>
I find that both elegant and easier to read. I haven' used dispatch tables much but time to go read about them again.  : )

<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2007-09-29T02:05:45</h3>
The "but time to go read about them again" is the main reason I don't want to use them... I'm trying to keep stuff as utterly boring and minimalist as possible.<br><br>But you are right the if/else chain is VISUALLY hard to read, so I might do something to fix that instead of moving to dispatch table.<br>

<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2007-09-29T03:09:16</h3>
<p>Technically that&#8217;s not even a dispatch table (since it does not map from strings to coderefs). I don&#8217;t know why people &#8220;need to read about them&#8221; either &#8211; I came up with the concept independently long before I knew it had a name. Seems obvious to me, and I don&#8217;t think I am a genius&#8230; what do I know.</p>

<p>And actually, I don&#8217;t know why Ovid rewrote the code the way he did, because it&#8217;s easy to make it even simpler:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>sub run {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $self = shift;<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return 1 if $self-&gt;action eq 'error';<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $method = $method_for{ $self-&gt;action } || 'view_index';<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return $self-&gt;$method;<br>}</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>I think this pushes the readability difference beyond the point where the improvement is arguable.</p>
