<p>I'm one or two test runs away from completing the image-generation elements of the new <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perl::Dist">Perl::Dist</a> implementation.<br/><br/>This means I will be able to do distribution releases in .zip form for people to test (they won't have the .exe or .msi installer).<br/><br/>While I continue onwards to finish the re-implementation of the .exe install generation, I'd like to get some feedback from people on any modules that they would like to come pre-installed with <a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl</a>.<br/><br/>Up to this point, I've wanted to limit the extra modules in Strawberry to just toolchain modules, and create a separate "Chocolate Perl" that bundles a whole ton of extras.<br/><br/>But feedback from Strawberry users seems to show there's a preferred middle group, with some small set of modules bundled that are otherwise very difficult to install (Expat and libxml are the biggest two requested).<br/><br/>I'd add SQLite to that list, but unfortunately <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBD::SQLite">DBD::SQLite</a> is currently broken on Win32 due to a forking (and thus failing) test.<br/><br/>What else would people like to come pre-installed with Strawberry, other than toolchain modules like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?PAR::Dist">PAR::Dist</a>.</p>

<h2>Nothing More</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Mr. Muskrat/">Mr. Muskrat</a> on 2007-11-07T02:47:50</h3>
I'd like nothing more than the ones you listed already (Expat and libxml).  It is going to be really difficult to pick and choose otherwise because there are quite a few "cool" modules that don't install easily.



<h2>Amen.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jk2addict/">jk2addict</a> on 2007-11-07T03:17:54</h3>
Definately expat/libxml will make lives easier.<br><br>As far as DBD::SQLite is concerned, even if there wasn't a test failure, I vote for not including 1.13/1.14. There's a nasty PK bug in those (Yes damnit, I keep not filing an RT for this) on win32.

To go along with libxml...the other headache module us it's twin: libxslt.

<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2007-11-12T00:42:18</h3>
pexports seems to crash on libxslt, so for the moment it's just going to be libxml2

OpenSSH and OpenSSL

Install <a href="http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html" title="slproweb.com">Win32 OpenSSL</a slproweb.com> and Strawberry Perl will use it just fine.<br/><br/>I haven't tried OpenSSH yet.

Nope, didn't work. Not the lite version anyways...

<h2>Re:more external libraries</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Mr. Muskrat/">Mr. Muskrat</a> on 2007-11-08T14:15:56</h3>
Yep.  The description of the regular version says that it is recommmended for software developers.

<p>Unfortunately, their installer requires Administrator privileges, which is bad as it prevents you from being able to copy the Perl directory around. The DLLs should go into the same directory as <tt>perl.exe</tt> so they are always around... Also, it would be nice if even Strawberry Perl was of the "Batteries Included" kind, and not only Chocolate<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<h2>Request for Comments: Strawberry Perl pre-installe</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Corion/">Corion</a> on 2007-11-07T07:14:27</h3>
<p>I'd like SQLite to be in the distribution (and DBI), but if there's something other than a failing <tt>fork()</tt> test, skip it.</p>
<p>Another thing that would be really nice to have is SSL support via <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/dland/Crypt-SSLeay-0.57/SSLeay.pm" title="cpan.org">Crypt::SSLeay</a cpan.org> out of the box, but I'm not sure if LWP is on your list. Maybe that's more chocolatey. I hope I can give you a "distro-builder" that downloads the "current" OpenSSL binaries (that is, DLL) and puts them in the right place on Windows, so rebuilding the distribution gets less painful.</p>

At the moment SQLite only fails from the broken test.<br><br>LWP is part of the upgrades for the toolchain, so adding SSLeay to that is problem a good idea.<br>

<h2>The items on the win32 wiki Misc list ?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/renodino/">renodino</a> on 2007-11-07T16:04:14</h3>
Or at least libwin32, which is pretty valuable for building other Win32 apps.
<p>
Also, if including DBD::SQLite, then shouldn't DBI be included ?</p>



<h2>DBD::SQLite Bug</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jk2addict/">jk2addict</a> on 2007-11-07T19:55:16</h3>
This thread and my plea to NOT use 1.13/1.14 prompted me to finally file the RT once I re-figured out how to reproduce it.<br><br><a href="http://rt.cpan.org//Ticket/Display.html?id=30558" title="cpan.org">http://rt.cpan.org//Ticket/Display.html?id=30558</a cpan.org><br><br>It's a pretty nasty one, and the only reason I ever caught it was some PK violation tests in Handel, where the subsequent tests after the PK violation tests were also failing under 1.13+
