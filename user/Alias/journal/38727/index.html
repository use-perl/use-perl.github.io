<p>These are the summary notes for the work completed during the 2009 QA Hackathon<br/><br/>The summary reports/talks were videoed, and the video should appear somewhere in a little while. But in the mean time, here's the short version.<br/><br/>* <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Smolder">Smolder</a> was converted by Michael to be compatible with the CPAN and was released to the CPAN for the first time.<br/><br/>* JJ completed an initial release of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perldoc::Server">Perldoc::Server</a><br/><br/>* configure_requires was completed by Jos and signed off by Adam, which completes the entire configure_requires project once the prod release is synced to core.<br/><br/>* A dev-quality MYMETA.yml implementation was completed by Andreas, Jos, Adam and David<br/><br/>* Programmatic access to the CPAN Uploads data is now available via <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?ORDB::CPANUPloads">ORDB::CPANUploads</a><br/><br/>* The CPAN Testers websites now update from PAUSE within a few minutes of an upload, thanks to a new magic fast-sync process created by Andreas.<br/><br/>* The Metabase implementation has progressed, powered by Dave and Ricardo
	- There is a new much more-detailed CPAN Testers report format
	- Fact management and user profiles (and registration) has been implemented
	- <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Reporter">Test::Reporter</a> is being upgraded to a full CPAN Testers Client
	- Test::Reporter::Metabase has been created as a temporary stand-in in the mean time.<br/><br/>* The nested TAP implementation implementation was mostly completed
	- Test::More was upgraded to support nested TAP
	- Test::Class was upgraded to support nested TAP
	- Test::Harness is halfway to supporting nested TAP<br/><br/>* Colin and Schwern have started working on Test::Builder 2
	- Results will be a detailed object
	- Output will not be limited to TAP<br/><br/>* The TAP IETF Draft Standard is mostly completed and will be posted in the next few days<br/><br/>* CPANPLUS was improved to help it integrate better with smoke systems.<br/><br/>(I was typing this rapidly as the reports were given, so please feel free to comment with additions and corrections)</p>

<h2>Some additions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dagolden/">dagolden</a> on 2009-03-30T22:04:01</h3>
<p>
You left off that Tux released <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Config::Perl::V" title="cpan.org">Config::Perl::V</a cpan.org>, which provides structured
information from 'perl -V' -- including things that aren't available from
Config.pm.
</p><p>
To clarify the CPAN Testers evolution, at least from the client
perspective:
</p><p>
Stage 1: Test::Reporter::Transport::Metabase will soon be available as a
means to submit test reports to a CPAN Testers Metabase using existing
clients (CPAN/CPAN::Reporter or CPANPLUS/CPAN::YACSmoke) that support
Test::Reporter::Plugins.  The reports will still be primarily the same text
report as exist today, augmented with any structured data that can be
parsed out of the report using tools from Andreas and Tux.
</p><p>Stage 2: CPAN Testers report generation and submission will be
consolidated from CPAN/CPAN::Reporter, CPANPLUS and Test::Reporter into a
new CPAN::Testers::Client module that communicates with a CPAN Testers
Metabase.  There will be adaptors specific to CPAN and CPANPLUS to deal
with slight variations in how they each provide information about
distributions being tested.  (Jos and I hammered out the future API for the
client on Sunday.) </p><p>
As CPAN and CPANPLUS are upgraded to use the
new client instead, the current use of CPAN::Reporter/Test::Reporter will
be removed and CPAN Testers will be only be using the Metabase
infrastructure, not email submission with NNTP archives.  These reports
will be entirely structured data and the old textual report will not be
generated.
</p><p>
Stage 3: When enough testers are switched over and the system has a
shakedown period, a date to retire the cpan-testers@perl.org email list
will be announced.
</p><p>-- dagolden</p>



<h2>pretty minor additions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mpeters/">mpeters</a> on 2009-03-31T18:36:55</h3>
<p>but just thought I'd add them for completeness. I released 2 new modules Module::Build::TAPArchive and Module::Build::Smolder.</p>
