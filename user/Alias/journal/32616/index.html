<div class="span8">
<p>Last Sydney.pm someone suggested that I post up a "top 10 things I could use some help with" on my website.<br/><br/>It's an interesting idea, but one that would be tricky.<br/><br/>You see, the most important things that need to be done often block on political and communication issues.<br/><br/>As evidence of this, just look at how much work gets done at the big hackfests, simply because all or most of the major players are in the same room.<br/><br/>Communications, politics and management also have the tendency to have long-term effects. As an example, look at the current less-than-optimal state of Template Toolkit. Because Andy has been tied up with other things and TT doesn't have a succession plan for release management, TT users have in some cases been left stranded (TT hasn't installed on Win32 for a year now) despite members of the community generating patches and being willing to deal with the problems.<br/><br/>This is the Continuity or Death theme again.<br/><br/>But I digress.<br/><br/>While I'm not sure I have a list of 10 things that are all politics free, I certainly have one big highlight. One project you could write or help write that, I feel, would be hugely important to the future improvement of the CPAN.<br/><br/>And it goes something like this... (shimmer out to dream/animation sequence)<br/><br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>The CPAN Open Data API<br/><br/>Module interrelations on the CPAN are now too complex for them to be maintained and managed by wetware alone.<br/><br/>There exists a number of important issues across the graph of module dependencies, such as bitrot and back-compatibility, and so on.<br/><br/>Most of these issues can or could be expressed programatically. Metrics could easily be developed for many of these issues.<br/><br/>The data required to develop these metrics is spread out over many different CPAN services, and is currently unapproachable.<br/><br/>Over the course of the year I hope to see every CPAN-related service exporting database dumps, most likely in the form of SQLite database. A number do this already. I'd like to see all of them doing so soon.<br/><br/>Access to the data is a different issue to being able to exploit the data.<br/><br/>With this in mind, I'd like to see the following.<br/><br/>1. A unified schema that ties together all CPAN-related datasets, implemented using (most likely) SQLite.<br/><br/>2. A pre-built CPAN module that would provide a convenient ORM layer over the top of this schema. This would most likely be done using something like DBIx::Class.<br/><br/>3. A second CPAN module that would pull data from the CPAN index and every other CPAN-related system that publishes datasets, and munge them together to create the SQLite database containing all the data.<br/><br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>You can see the beginnings of my attempt at this at <a href="http://svn.phase-n.com/svn/cpan/trunk/CPAN-Index/">http://svn.phase-n.com/svn/cpan/trunk/CPAN-Index/</a>.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I'm a DBIx::Class newbie and I really haven't the time to work on this anywhere near as much as I would like.<br/><br/>Why is this so important?<br/><br/>By having these three elements in place, it enables not just access to the CPAN data, but CONVENIENT and PROGRAMMATIC access to it.<br/><br/>It means that anybody that would like to develop a metric for, say, bitrot (using age of the last release and the number of bugs reported and such) can do so fairly easily.<br/><br/>And from there it would be fairly trivial to throw a Catalyst of ttree website on top of those metrics to create interesting new services. <br/><br/>Imagine a sort of "CPAN's 10 Most Rotten Modules" website which lists the modules that are both the most rotten AND have the most other modules depending on them.<br/><br/>These sorts of tools would allow us to focus maintenance efforts where they are most needed, which is something that will be increasingly important as we head for 20,000 modules.

<h2>I just need the free time</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2007-03-08T18:49:38</h3>
This is something I'd like to work on, as soon as I have a lot of free time. My interest is getting at the data and populating the databases.



<h2>Bravo</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/DAxelrod/">DAxelrod</a> on 2007-03-08T19:39:32</h3>
<p>This is exactly the kind of project I was anticipating with my <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/DAxelrod/journal/30537" title="perl.org">very first journal entry</a perl.org>.</p>

<p>I would love to help out with this. Unfortunately, I cannot promise much in the way of tuits in the near future. However, at very least, expect me to publish some thoughts on the design aspects of this after I dust them off and edit them.</p>



<h2>CPANTS &amp;amp; SQLite</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/domm/">domm</a> on 2007-03-08T20:25:20</h3>
At GPW, I discovered the quite usefull module DBD::PgLite::MirrorPgToSQLite. Using this, it's totaly easy to generate a SQLite dump of the CPANTS DB.<br><br>As soon as I find some time to finish the setup on the new (yet again) server, you can expect a daily dump of all CPANTS data to sqlite.<br><br>WRT to DBIx::Class: I'm already using it to access the CPANTS DB, and could probably help out with creating some of the tools you're talking about. BUT: I have a big project to finish until 2nd April, plus my day job, plus YAPC::Europe, plus 2 kids and a girlfriend - so don't count on much to happen from my side in the next four weeks...



<h2>what CPAN Index would good for</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/markjugg/">markjugg</a> on 2007-03-23T23:34:56</h3>
I'm interested to help with this as well. Last night I ran into a use case:<br><br>I was thinking about packaging up a script with the whole dependency chain so it could be easily installed. CPAN-Index could  me query to see exactly what the dependency chain is.<br><br>
