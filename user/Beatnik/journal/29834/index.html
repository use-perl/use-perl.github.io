<p>I recently posted a release note on the mod_perl mailing list. Someone responed to my cry for help and we started discussing the project a little. One of the comments was that, he didn't know it existed. If he had known, he would've helped sooner.
Here's my question.. I posted 'it' on <a href="http://www.freshmeat.net">Freshmeat</a>, I posted releases on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net">Sourceforge</a> pages. I occasionally update the listings at <a href="http://www.cmsmatrix.org/">CMS Matrix</a>. 
What else can I do to let people know the project exists without bragging?</p>

mention it on use.perl which is syndicated heavily or your personal blog or if you are replying to something relevent.<br><br>Or advertise it in your email sigs to lists<br><br>

<p>I was quite surprised to find no mention (or link) of (to) name of
the software in your blog entry itself; found, instead, links to three
"entry points" of the sites where you did mentioned your software.
</p>

<p> Anyway, thanks for the relevant SourceForge link.  BTW, "Alternate
datatypes" page -- <a href="http://spine.sourceforge.net/alternate.html" title="sourceforge.net">http://spine.sourceforge.net/alternate.html</a sourceforge.net> --
seems to be missing (file-not-found).
</p>

<p> I also thank you that SPINE can work with mod_perl2 for various
reasons<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...

</p><ul>
<li> Currently i am working with a PHP4 CMS <small>(of rather
messy code base where global variables play hide &amp; seek;
powers-that-be have focus on the web interface, not so much on
cleanup/maintenance of the code)</small> which is used with Apache2.
I rather not deal with two versions (2.2 &amp; 1.3; latter is used by Pair
on shared servers &amp; i installed locally to mirrot/test my portion of the Web)
of Apache.
</li>

<li> I really need to learn about Perl DBI, some major/popular
database, and mod_perl* so to be able to change jobs (especially now
that i can put PHP too on my resume).
</li>
</ul>

I suck at marketing<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I always feel like I'm overdoing it. Anyway, I'm glad you find it useful. There's actually a lot more stuff included than it first appears. I hope to update some documentation pretty soon (thanks to a new contributor).. as well as get the stable release out the door. The mod_perl support has been added since that beta, but I tried to stick to the same basics as mod_perl 1. Let me know what you think and spread the word if you will. Patches, contributions, cash, free beer welcome<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Half the problem is that it's a bloody CMS.<br><br>Which is not to insult your application, since I've never used it, but you have created an application in the most sexy/popular area (CMSes) or the most sexy/popular coding type (Web Programming).<br><br>You are bound to have some significant issues with promotion amoungst the bazillion other CMSes.<br><br>But on that note, there's a number of CMS recommendation/listing sites out there, and you should be listed on every single one of them if you can.<br><br>Most of those lists are PHP-heavy and whenever I'm looking for something like that I get annoyed there aren't many Perl options available.<br><br>And finally, add it to your sig, and boil your app down to something that set you apart, so people will get curious.<br>is trivia<br>Best Regards<br><br>Adam Kennedy<br>Spine - The Perl CMS that installs anywhere (standalone/CGI/mod_perl/clusters)<br><br>

I think one of the problems is that I don't have any reference sites. Back in 2000, when I started developing it, there were only a handful of of CMSs out there. I based the concept on a patchy PHP based CMS. It was pretty difficult to have the app grow as fast as the technology... so it got old pretty fast. Moving it to mod_perl was, IMHO, a pretty smart thing to do. It boosted functionality and stability. I still try to stay away from the real buzzword technologies, try to keep the dependency list as small as possible and do what I think is right. In the end, I do it for myself<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>I'll probably start looking at some other listings and get it added. I'm not sure what I'll have to do to get it added to <a href="http://perl.apache.org/products/products.html" title="apache.org">the mod_perl related software page</a apache.org> but I'll try sending a mail to the docs-dev mailing list.
