<p>Any driver's worst nightmare: One of those lights that you never knew existed on your dashboard starts blinking. Apparently my oil level was down. Since it happened on a sunday, I couldn't just call the dealership and ask them which type of oil I needed. Newer engines are a bit sensitive.. So is my boss about my company car. Pouring in just any type of oil was out of the question. I read the book back to back. The gas station I stopped at didn't have the exact oil that was mentioned in the book... Sometimes 'close enough' means 'if you pour this in, your car will explode'. After calling a few people, I got the most expensive oil I could find that had "Diesel engine" on the label. I kept my RPM really low and checked with the dealership this morning. It seems that I made the right call because my engine didn't blow up..yet.</p>
