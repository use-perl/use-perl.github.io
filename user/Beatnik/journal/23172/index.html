<div class="span8">
<p>One of our national secretaries mentioned in a newspaper article that he reads about 25 newspapers each day. First of all, I'd like to say: <b>You're fucking fired!</b>. I don't pay taxes so you can read papers all day. Second. how long does it take to read one newspaper? If it takes about an hour (read a few articles quickly enough, check some headlines, etc). it would take more than one day. He also mentioned he visited <a href="http://www.resto.be/ware/details.jsp?businessid=13584">a restaurant in Kortrijk</a> occasionally. I too am   an occasional visitor of that restaurant. If I ever bump into him over there, I might just ask him.<br><br>Vincent, if for one reason or another, you're reading this, it'd better be on your own time!</p>

<h2>It's not quite impossible</h2>

Reading 2 papers does not take twice the time of reading 1 paper.<p>
Quite a large proportion of the content is from wireservices - and therefore the same in most (all?) papers. And practice makes you read faster than 1 hour for a newspaper - I read 4 on my way in in the train,m and still have time to spare at the end. One of them is a high-density, reading-intensive one without many pictures, it takes over half an hour, while the 2 free ones (MetroExpress and a look-a-like competitor) take about 5 minutes each - a little longer if the column on the last-page is read-worthy.</p><p>
I would be terribly bored having to read 25 newspapers, but impossible? No. there should even be time left for some 'real work' before lunch.</p>

He works for the government! The secretary has no clue what real work is all about<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) You know the type.. you've seen people come in at 10, sleep 2 hours, take 2 hour lunch breaks and race past the punch clock at 4.

I know. I worked for the goverment for 10 years. When someone asked how many worked at our place, we often answered (truthfully) "Oh, about 25%".<p>
With many civil servants I would prefer that they read newspapers rather than do harm by doing thier 'real job'<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>
