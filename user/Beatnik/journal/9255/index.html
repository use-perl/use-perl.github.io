<p>After some occasional hacking, I finally managed to find some moments to squeeze in the Plugin idea I was keeping on ice for a while now. I had some older code worked out but I rewrote from scratch. The reason I hacked at <a href="http://spine.sf.net">SPINE</a> again was pretty simple. We're building one of those family websites and I planned on putting this journal online. Now either I had a cronjob fetch it.. The TRUE perl way made me implement it as a plugin :) One glitch in all this was <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-UsePerl-Journal/">WWW::UsePerl::Journal</a>
. There is no <i>clean</i> way I found to get the subject from a certain entry without looping through the subject hash. I tried contacting the author but mails bounced. Guess I'll have to look on IRC :) or even here. Russell Matbouli, if you read this... How do I get a subject fron a certain entry without hacking my way thru?<br><br>Anyway, since I managed to get a basic plugin running, I grabbed <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bone-Easy/">Bone::Easy</a> and wrote a 8 line plugin that generates random pickup lines :)<br><br>I had a really pleasant phone call with Ann, one of my best friends (and the Ex you've been hearing aboot). She can still make me smile. How are things with that curly girl? Well, I'm in the friend zone still. I'm oki with that. It won't spoil MY day :)<br><br>In short, my reviews of movies I saw over the past month or so: Minority Report: pretty cool (8/10), Paulinne &amp; Paulette: Fabulous. (9/10). Red Dragon: nice thriller, tight storyline altho I didn't get WHY he chooses those women. (8/10). Harry Potter and the secret chamber: pretty ok for a kid movie (6/10).</p>
