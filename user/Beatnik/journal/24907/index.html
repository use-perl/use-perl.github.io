<p>Slashdot reports that the <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/it/05/05/27/145234.shtml?tid=172&tid=219"><i>US has asked Great Britain to use the same chips in their proposed identity cards as the ones in our proposed identity card.</i></a> Not sure how this ID idea is all brand new. In Belgium, ID cards have been around for <i>superbeing</i> knows how long. Chips on ID cards have been around for at least a year here, while other types of government required cards (e.g. social security card) have been using these for a couple of years. In fact, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">our all-time favorite monopolist</a> worked with the belgian government on supporting the chip into MSN somehow to prevent pervs from picking up kids through Messenger. <br><br>I wonder how long it will take before the UK participates in the EURO. Hopefully not as long as it took them to realize giving their citizens IDs was actually a GOOD thing.</p>

I'm wondering how long it will be before the <em>U.S.</em> starts participating in the Euro.  It's a one-standard thing.  Should be easy to sell in this day and age.  "The Euro will make us safer!  Only terrorists use regular dollars!"

I can't tell if you intended that remark to be interpreted literally.  If I were saying it, I'd have to express it sarcastically.
<p>
Universal identification cards with radio chips are evil.  Let me make that clear.</p>

And I would have to add that there is no way in hell I would vote to be in the EU. The U.N. is bad enough trying to usurp national sovereignty.
