<p>Today I got a few things that made me feel right at home... I got a iButton and a key to the front door, a brand new (super cool) laptop with extra large screen and an itenerary for my trip to Paris next week.. whii</p>

Thought about summonning an emergency social of Paris.pm ?

I'll have to check with my co-worker... but the thought has definitly crossed my mind<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Ok, don't keep us in suspense. What kind of super cool new laptop did you get? PowerBook 17"? Inquiring minds want to know<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) (And those of us who aren't lucky enough to have their own super cool laptop yet...)

It's a Dell Inspiron 6000, with  15.4" screen, enough memory to get truecolor in 1920x1200, wireless (g), bluetooth, 4 USB ports, 40 gigs of HD (so I'll probably get some linux dist on there too), 1.5 Ghz CPU, 512 meg RAM. I'm still trying to get it connected to my 3Com OfficeConnect AP tho.

Nice<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I'll be getting a notebook in a few weeks, so I've been looking around at different ones. I meant to ask you: How did you like that iBook you mentioned back in December? The new 15" PBs look pretty neat, too.

The iBook was pretty ok.. although I didn't test it long enough to judge.. If it weren't for the hype, I'm not sure I would get one.. My work currently concentrates around Windows and Unix flavours so I see no iBook in my near future.. perhaps an iPod<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D

Ah, yes. Hype<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Most developers I know locally use Windows. Not an iBook or Powerbook to be found. And those I do know with them aren't developers, more like home/power users. I'm just trying to figure out if the Unixy-hype with Macs is more talk than anything.

Mac OS X <b>is</b> Unix way deep under the hood (variant FreeBSD on top of variant Mach kernel), you really can get a shell if you want one. And source packages that build for X and FreeBSD reportedly work ok. Apple is even shipping X11 with 10.3 now, you don't have to aftermarket it.
It's just not your father's XWM, to paraphrase a Buick ad.
<p> I was going to say it doesn't have the huge<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.RPM or<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.DEB repository behind it, but it turns out there is <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/index.php" title="sourceforge.net">fink</a sourceforge.net>, a port of Debian's DPKG+APT to Max OSX, with 5,196 packages in "Stable", including <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/index.php?phpLang=en" title="sourceforge.net">most of the usual suspects</a sourceforge.net>.
</p> <p>One can debate <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MacOsxIsUnixBased" title="c2.com">whether OSX is a better Unix than LinuxPPC</a c2.com> or not, but a Unix that really does look like a Mac can't be a bad thing.
</p> <p>
If I didn't <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/n1vux/journal/24815" title="perl.org">want to mess-around with the *nix</a perl.org> somewhat, a mac-style laptop would have been a contender for me, now that they're real unix. Certainly there are a significant number of PM'ers who like Power Books. Since I'm almost as fond of the Power architecture as the Alpha, I could have started collecting G3 macs and a PowerBook instead of old Alphas for be-Debian-izing.</p>

Yes, Mac OS X runs on top of a Unix flavor but it's not the real deal. The short time I spent working on an iBook didn't convince me to go out and buy one. It would take longer to convince (to buy an apple, not to ditch windows).
