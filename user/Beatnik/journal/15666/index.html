<p>This rant is the result of a discussion with Annika. I confess I myself am guilty of generalizing and categorizing men and women... but I will do my best to stop doing that.<br><br>
I believe everyone is unique and stating <i>all men are the same</i> is just plain silly. Your boyfriend/girlfriend is ofcourse different than everyone else.. but then again <b>everyone else is different</b> than everyone else. Just because you had bad experience with someone, doesn't mean everyone is bad. Just because your current boyfriend/girlfriend is kind and sweet, that doesn't mean (s)he was born this way or that (s)he will never change. I'm sure all your exes were at some point kind and sweet and you never figured they would hurt you or break up with you. On the other side, maybe you were the one breaking up, you were the one hurting someone's feelings because you thought you found someone else who was different than everybody else you met before... But then again, we all know everybody you meet should be <i>different</i> or otherwise we wouldn't find that person alluring. Jumping from one partner to another is ofcourse perfectly OK but that would pressumably only satisfy sexual needs. Just because your ex didn't have another girlfriend between your break-up and the happy reuniting, that doesn't mean he handles the breakup easily. Maybe he's lying, maybe he's just shy, maybe he just couldn't get a new girlfriend... Ofcourse this also counts for women. Just because some girl doesn't have a boyfriends since her last breakup, that doesn't mean she's still getting over it. Maybe she didn't have time, maybe she's rejecting men by the bushes or maybe she's just hoping to get back together with one of her exes.<br><br>
Yes, men and women are different.. but then again, <b> everyone is different</b>. Prejudice is a very nasty thing... <br><br>Can I have a quotation for this rant? How did I do? Thumbs up? Did I make <b>ANY</b> sense at all?!?</p>

I've always been the victim of strong women<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D Actually, my 2 latest g/fs dumped me. The first because she was probably using me until she found someone better (ofcourse later you find out), the other one.. well it was a distance and time thing.. but she's still one of my best friends so I'm glad I still have this.<br> <br>I think at some point I got tired of women always claiming that all men are pigs and that women don't do that sort of things, that women are too sensitive and men are too insensitive. If I have to go by my own experience (which I ofcourse wont), I'd say it's quite the opposite<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
