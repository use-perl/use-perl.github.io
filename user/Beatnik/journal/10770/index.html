<p>Things are still spooking thru my mind. I'm realizing things, things I should've realized ages ago, things that sting a bit. A part of me just wants to pick up the phone and just tell her that I don't want to pressure her into going with me. Another part just wants to pick up the phone and talk to her the entire night, hoping things work out. The part of me that stayed up all night, just hopes all this wont influence what we have and what we had. She's one of the sweetest people I know and the thought of not <i>having</i> her around, scares me. Yes, I do still have strong feelings for her but no, I don't want to force her to feel the same things... so I'm giving up and it hurts like hell. I think I'll just lay low for a while, not call her next week, maybe the week after... We'll see how I end up feeling.</p>

<p>Perhaps you should call sooner.  The week's silence could be misinterpreted.<br> </p><p>Distance is good sometimes, but you want to make it clear that you still want things to work out.  You don't need to talk all night and you shouldn't have expectations about what the call will do, but do call.  Just say "hi" and chat about things in general, you know, check in, if there's really nothing else to say.<br> </p><p>As I said, I'm no expert here.  Who is?  I just recall a similar situation where I tried to get some distance and it came close to ruining everything.  Hmmm... I remember getting some distance once and it did ruin everything in that relationship, but now I'm glad...<br> </p><p>I guess there's no single answer.</p>

I actualyl considered not calling for 2 weeks... just to allow me to think things thru. Maybe that's the exact opposite. I think I'll give her a buzz tomorrow evening, if I'm too tired<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(<br> <br>Thanks for your opinion<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
