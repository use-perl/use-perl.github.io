<p>After the whole spam research thing, I started calling potential customers again. After a few short calls, I decided to call back to a customer I couldnt get through to earlier. The IT guy, also being the CEO (yes, an SME), didn't have problems with virusses (since he had 2 scanners installed and updated the database every day) but he was pretty pissed about spam. Apparently a former employee got a lot spam and when he left, the CEO inherited his mail when it was redirected to catch-all. After doing some initial preparation for information booklets and a first meeting, I started doing some <i>research</i> about virusses. Apparently, some TV show is doing a docu about virusses and SoBIG in particular. We were contacted to provide some basic material and their editing team would distille some texts. Google is your friend!<br><br>I ordered my lunch around noon but when my co-workers arrived back at the office around 4, they didn't bring it! I had lunch (you know... food you usually eat around noon) at 4.30 PM. For some reason, time seemed to be shifted back for a few hours since I got supper at 10.20 PM. Anyway, after eating my late lunch, we headed over to the business partner event of a large cable ISP. They had free food (free lunch) and free booze (no free beer). We, ofcourse, also were forced to listen to over 2 hours of sales talk about new pricings, better support, new services, etc. The good part is that I got one of those laser pointers (and a badge for my collection). Bad news is that I didn't get home until 10.10 PM so I didn't eat until 10.20 PM.</p>

because I'm eating my lunch as I read this, and it is 4:54 in the afternoon!
