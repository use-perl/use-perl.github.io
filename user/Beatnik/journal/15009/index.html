<p>After my visit to the employment office, I had a quite long meeting.. discussing prototyping and technical analysis of the Delphi project. We took a short break for lunch (although I barely had time for a bite). The meeting took til half past 3 and I managed to get enough time to make some phone calls. The 19" TFT we ordered arrived today.. SWEEEEET. The remaining hours of my day (5 of them), I divided between building prototypes and getting technical documents and invitation out the door for the demo on monday.<br><br>By the time I got home, dad prepared some cole flower and a saignant heart... It's not like anyone needs that anyway.<br><br>
Speaking of hearts, apparently Annika has a new boyfriend.. well an old one, since she recycled one of her exes. Well, I'm truly happy for her.<br><br>I'm revising my old material on Perl. about 2 years ago, I got extra credit for teaching Perl in school. I also offered that course to the IT student body and they accepted. so I'm teaching the course again this year. I'm actually considering putting together a small text on Perl 6 (how it looks in P6E anyway).. the things that look really cool.</p>
