<p>Well, I planned on visiting Prague this weekend for work. The customer confirmed  friday we were going. I first heard about the trip on tuesday. Earlier today I got informed I needed a passport (<i><b>Oh Great...</b></i>). I rushed home and fetched my (expired) passport (<i><b>Oh Great..</b></i>). Eventually we arrived at the airport (my customer was taking his laptop, the PC I developed the project on, the IBM 4400 printer, a box of thermal paper, a box of ribbons and his trolly. It was quite strange seeing him walking in in shorts, a T-Shirt and a cap when all the previous meetings he wore a suite. Anyway, he checked in most of the stuff as plain luggage but was forced to take the computer, his laptop bag and the printer as hand luggage. Since I wasn't allowed to get on the plane, he had to carry that stuff himself. It was amusing seeing him run back and forth between where he dropped the PC and where he dropped the printer. Anyway, he called me once he arrived in Prague to discuss a phone conference he planned tomorrow. <b><i>UGH</i></b>.<br><br>
I was really looking forward to visiting Prague but since my passport was expired and there was no way for me to get a new one in time, I have no guilt feeling :) I was going to miss a <b>BIG</b> party on monday (since I was going to be in Prague until wednesday morning) but now I'm going... <b>WHIIIIIIIIIIIIII</b></p>
