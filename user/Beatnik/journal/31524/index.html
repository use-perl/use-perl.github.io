<p>It's been a few years since I read the book but it left a good impression. I looked forward to seeing the movie. In general, the movie comes very closes to meeting my expectations of how it should've been done. It has a quick pace, is rarely boring (even in the pieces where the books tends to be). The setting and costumes are good, the 2 main female characters are gorgeous and Grenouille looked more or less as how I expected him to look. I expect a european and an american version of this move is released since there is lots of nudity (and I do mean LOTS)... but that's also exactly how I remember the book and all nudity is supporting the story. Go see (even if it is only the clean version)! You might just pick up a thing or two about making perfume.</p>

<p>I first read the book (in german) a few years ago and found it awesome, so I really have to go see the movie. Thanks for the encouraging comment<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I'd say after <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Die-Physiker-Durrenmatt/dp/3257208375/sr=1-2/qid=1162829706/ref=sr_1_2/202-1396914-2521453?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" title="amazon.co.uk">Die Physiker</a amazon.co.uk>, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Das-Parfum-Patrick-Suskind/dp/3257016786/sr=8-1/qid=1162829664/ref=pd_ka_1/202-1396914-2521453?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" title="amazon.co.uk">Das Parfum</a amazon.co.uk> is my favourite German book. I didn't know they made it into a <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0396171/" title="imdb.com">movie</a imdb.com> but I'll definitely go check it out!

<h2>The book, and its end.</h2>

<p>That's the same for me. Actually it was a gift from a woman I had been dating with for some time, because of some thing I told her. Indeed it's one of my favourite books. I look forward to seeing the movie, but I don't know when I will.</p>

<p>Speaking of the book, one thing that I've noticed is that its end tends to create a dichotomy amongst people: I've heard comments from many, and they either find it <em>fantastic</em> or <em>disappointing</em>. So far I haven't met anyone who thought it was, say, moderately good or mildly suboptimal.</p>

<p>PS: I don't know if "end" is the right term in this context and I really don't know how to search the internet for something better, but I think that it's easy to understand what I mean.</p>
