<p>I went to a local bookfair yesterday and picked up a few books that were still missing from my bookshelf. One of them was the dutch edition of The Art of Deception. I actually look forward to reading this one because social engineering has been stuck in my brainjar for quite a bit now. Another book (or rather set) I picked up was the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy bookset. They had the old and the new box.. It just felt right to pick the new one. To follow in the craze, I also bought Deception Point, which seems quite old already. I bought the other ones before the whole hype started (luckily). Last but not least I got a pocket of selected poems by Edgar Allan Poe and a copy of Letters from the Warzone (or rather, the dutch version of it). I'm not sure why I picked up that last one.. but then again, it was a bargain.</p>

This is a pretty good article by Mitnick about someone hired to break into a Vegas casino: <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/Next/Gambling-with-security/2005/03/07/1110160730077.html" title="theage.com.au">Gambling with Security</a theage.com.au>

Heh, I also went there on thursday, and got Mitnick's dutch version, and the HHGTTG pack<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
The choice of IT books was quite dissappointing, however<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(

A few years ago, I got a stack of O'Reilly books.. Now I was lucky to even found O'Reilly books. I managed to track down 1 Oracle book, some pockets and a stack of first editions of Perl 6 &amp; Parrot Essentials. I think my book case is reaching an O'Reilly saturation point<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Yep, half of my O'Reilly books come from there, the other half from FOSDEM<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;) Also got the Oracle SQL book, a Samba pocket reference and the Perl 6 book.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D<br/><br/>See you at the Perl workshop I guess!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
