<p>I walked to work this morning... There was still a lot of morning dew and the sun was partly covered in that typical morning fog. The grass had this distinct smell and I actually felt good afterwards (well, it was only a 25 minute walk).<br><br>I planned on using a totally different approach on getting new leads but for some reason my boss decided I should use the "free stuff" approach. We'll offer a very basic test to see if a company has adequate virus scanning on their incoming mail and if they use spam filters. Ofcourse this would eventually lead to suggesting our services. Another neat product I am promoting to potential customers is <a href="http://www.bynari.net">Bynari</a> products to drop-in replace Exchange. My boss was swearing and cursing while testing 2 wireless access points , I started feeding customer data into <a href="http://www.opengroupware.org">OpenGroupware</a>. It seems a bit b0rked at first but if you play long enough with it, it's quite nice.<br><br>One of my collegues is doing a test of webpads and how easy it is to get linux running on it. At some point, I got a call from someone from <a href="http://intersystems.com/">InterSystems</a> asking me all kinds of silly questions. Just when I was about to leave (I was actually already walking towards the door), another call came in. Someone with a lousy german accent wanted to know about our firewall setups and support for it. After a 5 minute talk, during which I explained most of the conditions, the line was cut off. I already had a strange feeling so I asked my collegue if I should try to call the customer back. Then it started to sink in. One of my other co-workers did a prank call. I'm already planning some way to get him back...<br><br><br/><br/>About 6 months ago, during a party, I had this uhm experience. An experience that still keeps me wakes me up sometimes. Think blond, about yay high and bright greenish-blueish eyes.</p>
