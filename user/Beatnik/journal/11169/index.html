<p>Things I learned this week...<br>
<li>I'm a pain in the ass to work with. </li>
I have a vision, guidelines if you will, about the current project and I'd like to see them followed. My cow-orker occasionally has this bad habbit (often referred to as 'an opinion') and it sometimes clashes with how I feel. Yes, I know mod_perl modules work in a different namespace than Apache::* but I'd like to see them all in the regular namespace... Yes, I realize we can have an inheritence fest but I'd prefer to stick to some basic inheritence and let the rest grow for itself... Yes, I know committing to CVS regulary can take some time but it'll pay of in the end... Yes, I know you like Java more than perl (and that's ok) but perl does things differently and that's how I like it.
<br><br>
<li>If you start jogging again after not having jogged for over 2 years, warm up properly.</li>
Thursday evening, I met up with A. to see a movie and I decided it'd be a good time to start jogging again but I didn't have enough time to warm up and I still feel it in my legs :( I was pretty tired by the time I got there but I don't regret it. Just warm up first next time!
<br><br>
<li>If you help people out on IRC, check their webpage first</li>I was helping some guy out on IRC while I was at work (hi boss!) and I asked him to put his code online. Apparently he put his file in a non-accessible directory and I ended up being redirected to the main page of the site... which was a gay pr0n site. No one really noticed it until I started closing browser windows like crazy and screamed 'NOOOOOOOOOOOOO' in the process. Don't forget I was still at work and we have a proxy. Lesson: Use a text browser on a shell account and make sure the people you help out actually verify the page shows the source and doesn't redirect to any type of pr0n.<br><br>
Things I already knew but still like to confirm are... that I like hanging out with A. and I appreciate the talks, hugs and backrubs we share.</p>
