<p>For some reason, my /usr partition (2.5 gig) was getting rather full and I figured I'd just reinstall when I had the time. Since I have exams on monday, I  don't have any time but somehow I installed Woody on my laptop. I think it was Schwern who called me a Debian person when I told I usually spend quite a lot of time tweaking and adding/removing stuff before I'm actually happy. I've been using RH for the past 5 years and I felt comfortable with it. The thrill of a new dist was appealing and 36 hours, 2 gig transfer, 5 kernel panics, 7 reinstalls, 2 CDs, 4 ISOs and lack of sleep later, I got a very skinny Debian. I'm still swearing and cursing and missing a lot of my old things. Fluxbox doesn't come with the remember patch, my soundcard apparently doesn't work properly, fonts in X are TOO big, I had to cheat to get phoenix installed, etc... <br><br>
Well, maybe I'm just looking for excuses to get RH back on here. I'll decide after I get back from Avoriaz. A friend suggested I'd drop by with my laptop to <i>fix half of the dist I claim isn't working</i>. Maybe I'll take him up on that offer. I'll have to reinstall my windows 2k as well :(It's b0rken for sure...<br><br>
Speaking of Avoriaz, I'll be there from the 7th til the 16th IIRC. That means I'll miss Valentines Day... that means I can't get a card sent to Ann :( Which means I'll have to take my cellphone to France to get a message thru.<br><br>
<b>YAPC::Eu 2003 Call for Papers</b> is open and I sent in my proposal : <i>Image manipulation in C and Perl</i>. I'm also considering contributing some articles to TPJ/TPR/DDJ. We'll see after I get back. The conference is from 23 til 25 July and chances are I'll be on vacation at that time... I hate to miss the conference  :(</p>

So you've looked into Debian. That's the spirit, I'd say.<br> <br>It seems to be a common pattern that other-distro-people sooner or later decide to migrate to Debian (or at least have a look into it). Debian appears to be a point of no return, at least as far as Linux is concerned (and rightly so).<br> <br>Once you have a fully configured Debian box there's not much else to discover about Linux (other than Linux from scratch perhaps). The only plausible thing to do afterwards is checking out some other UNIX-flavors. I did so with FreeBSD which is quite impressive really (and also a little more geekish than Linux nowadays;-).

Well, it's probably me nothing having the time (and the motivation) to look into it further right now. I'll probably end up using it for a few weeks and decide then if I'll jump back. I'm sure that I'll eventually can like it, it's just that there are quite a few things different than before. Ofcourse, it took me to time to get used to RH<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:))<br> <br>
We'll see how I end up.

Heh, debian was definitely "no return" for me - I installed it, spent two weeks getting annoyed by things that worked fine in RedHat and never returned to it.

<p>Of course, at home, I'm still using FreeBSD, which I find to be better than both.  But I need good ldap and PAM integration at work.
