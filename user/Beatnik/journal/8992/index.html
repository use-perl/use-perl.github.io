<p>The past 3 days will be remembered as Late Night Weekend.<br><br><i><b>Edgar Allen Poe mood</b></i>
<br><br>Once upon a midnight dreary (<i>I think it was last thursday</i>), while I pondered, weak and weary (<i>well, I wasn't actually pondering</i>,<br>
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,<br>
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping (<i>tapping?? my cellphone rang.. does that count?</i>),<br>
As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door (<i>No, still my cellphone ringing</I>).<br>
"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door (<i>stop ringing! Damnit!</i>);<br>
Only this, and nothing more." (<i>actually, I was muttering aboot the party I was going to</i>)<br><br>
Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December, (<i>Still November here</i>)
<br>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. (<i>Don't you scare me with this ghost shit!</i>)<br>
Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
From my books surcease of surrow, sorrow for the lost Lenore (<i>oki, let's <b>for arguments sake</b> assume her name is Lenore.. <B>which is isn't</b> but let's just assume</i>).<br>
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore,(<i>Well, I don't call her Lenore... which isn't even her name... go figure</i>)<br> Nameless here forevermore. <br><br>
Anyway, I went to a party on thursday, got there around midnight-ish, got some free goodies, had a few cokes and partied til nearly 4.30 AM. Got home at 5 AM (which is pretty normal since I was sober enough) and slept til 1 PM. Met up a friend around 3 PM and headed to a birthday party with a sixpack of local brewski, had a few drinks and headed home around 9-ish with a pretty high alcohol level in my bloodstream. Saturday, I got up around 11, not feeling to well but I managed to get thru the day. Just when I was aboot to get some sleep (around 10 PM), a friend called, asking for a favour. I grabbed my laptop and the minimum number of ORA books and headed over there. I ended up spending a few hours writing a client/server app for a proprietary protocol running on a server we didn't have access to :( I somehow managed to write a fake server out of the (far from perfect) specs we had. Halfway thru final testing, someone mentioned they had C# code for that server. After I finished my code, the REXX code (which wouldn't work), was fixed and ran smoothly. <b>AAAARGH!</b><br><br>All things considered, I had a fun late night hacking session with some friends. <br><br>
People are still reading my mind : my life as a  <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/comics/sf20021116.gif">Comic</a> - <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/comics/sf20021117.gif">Strip</a>.</p>
