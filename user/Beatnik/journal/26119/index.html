<div class="span8">
<p>A recent <a href="http://www.cooltechzone.com/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=1645&Itemid=0&limit=1&limitstart=0">article on CoolTechZone</a> is just a bit too biased for me :) I'm spending my last 10 minutes of <i>work-time</i> on this comment.<br><br>
Yes, Windows is cool.. Windows is popular. I'm not sure where the author got the estimated percentage of computers running Windows. I hope he is aware that not all <i>computers</i> are desktops? One quite obvious reason why no one is actually writing Linux virii is (IMHO) because of the flavours. Different kernel versions have different holes.. Linux runs on different platforms, different patches get applied, different dists have different applications . You can't really assume that a machine has sendmail installed by default these days. You can't assume that a specific configuration file is located in that specific directory. The reason why the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm">Morris worm</a> did as much damage as it did, was because there were only a handfull of UNIX flavours. There are probably as much holes (if not more) in linux distributions as there are in Windows.. Windows' popularity is the reason why so many virii exist. Ever since Windows 2000 I can't get my Connectix QuickCam to work properly. I didn't even try to get my Gravis Ultrasound Max to work on it, although I might get lucky with my IOMega ZIP drive (the 100 meg kind). All those devices work fine on my Linux. Yes, it takes me a few moments to compile my kernel because some things just can't get compiled as modules... When I got my new laptop, I had no trouble getting things to work on Linux (not more trouble than with Windows ofcourse).<br><br>I don't see what the european constitution has to do with the whole Microsoft issue... but then again you need something to pick on. Microsoft isn't alone in getting controlled by the European Justice department. <a href="http://www.inbev.com">Inbev</a> had to sell part of it's share in some breweries because they became too big.<br><br>The Windows EULA perhaps doesn't state you can't install other software but there have been a few cases where competing software didn't work as well as expected (<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/1999/11/05/how_ms_played_the_incompatibility/">MS Windows on DR-DOS</a>??)<br><br>
Yes, Microsoft 0wnz the desktop market.. but when it comes to Tablet PCs, PDAs and Media Centers, I have my doubts. They are still not household objects and they don't all run Windows.<br><br>Let the record state that I am a Windows user profesionally.. but I spend my free time on my Linux and I like it. At the workplace, there aren't that much Windows based machines (I'm guessing about 50%). <br><br>Aaah, another day well spent :) Weekend, here I come!</p>

<p>Where does the quality of their software fit into this sentence?</p>

I never said anything about the quality. Guessing by the number of people they have working on that product and the time they spend on it, I'd say they suck<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>Do you think that the quality of Microsoft's software might have <em>some</em> connection to the number of viruses that affect it?</p>

Is that a trick question or just a rhetorical one?

<p>I'll avoid explaining by giving an analogy.  Is the reason that there are so many buffer overflow attacks made against C programs and not Perl programs because it's more popular to write network programs in C than in Perl?  Is that a primary reason?</p>
