<p>I had another one of my driving lessons today. The instructor allowed me to hit the road and guided me through narrow and muddy backroads, across the language border (near Grez Doiceau and Bauvechain). I almost drove for 2 hours and I panicked quite a few times. All things considered, I think I did quite well.</p>

<h2>the sea</h2>

<blockquote><div>across the language border</div></blockquote>
<p>My brain still can't quite grasp the concept of a land border. Round here, the border is the sea is the border. You mean, you cross this <i>fence</i> and you're in another country? Crazy concept. At least the Rhine can do a good impression of the sea as far as borders go, so I feel more comforable there, but you don't get bridges over the sea, so it's not perfect.</p>
<p>(OK I realise that the language border isn't another country. And we do have land borders between countries here, with the England/Wales border being more significant, because on the Welsh side all the road signs are bilingual. And whilst it is another country (at one level) it's the same country (for most other levels). IIRC all 4 countries in the United Kingdom have a different status within the whole. In fact, I have this suspicion that Northern Ireland isn't actually a country, as far as titles go. And we've not even mentioned crown dependancies yet, let alone the independant states that share defence and foriegn policy with the UK. (Isle of Man, Jersey, Baliwick of Guernsey))</p>
<p>Anyway, the sea is the border is the sea. And it keeps me safe from you. Until you pass your test.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
