<p>I recently installed Ubuntu on my laptop. I had an old CentOS dist that I didn't really use so I decided to play a bit with Ubuntu.
I had some trouble during the installation (Don't unset your bootable partition flag!) but that was more of a user problem than it was a software problem.
I did the Windows boot.ini trick with the boot sector dump and I had multiboot in a few minutes. Ubuntu supported all of my hardware out of the box (at least, I haven't found a device that wasn't supported yet), 
even the IPW2200 Wireless Ethernet Controller. I expected the same hassle as I had with Centos a few months ago but no problems there. One of the only things I dislike about it is how Metacity is configured with irritating focus settings.
When you hover over a window (even for a <i>few</i> milliseconds), it gets focus. The menu and buttons are very sensitive so I accidentally clicked on links and buttons a few times. The package management is quite tricky. Lots of apps I wanted to install, were either not available or wouldn't install unless I switched to advanced mode.
Subversion is not included a a default package and Cervisia required half a dozen other packages.. Guess I'll add Qt as well.

<h2>Ubuntu Rocks!</h2>

but I was going to wait until Dapper Drake goes final release in April before trying it on a laptop again. Is your wonderful result with 5.10 or 6.4-RC1 or what?

I'm using Breezy Badger.. I'll look into the Metacity focus issue when I have some spare time.
