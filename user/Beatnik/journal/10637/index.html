<p>Well, not <a href="http://www.ateamshrine.co.uk/ba.php">B.A Baracus</a> ofcourse. My first internship day went pretty good. I arrived at 9 AM, moved around some furniture and had a PC booting by 9.15. Unfortunatly, the PC I had to work on was a Debian install and I remember my days of swearing and cursing when I installed it on my laptop. Anyway, I got stuck apt-getting about every package I needed, including make, unzip, mc and perl 5.6.1. *ARGH*. I fooled around with gnome, KDE, fluxbox, gdm and kdm and eventually just went the easy way and used whatever was working properly... which turned out to be KDE. I installed glimmer, xchat, pharmacy, cvs, mozilla, galeon, dia, apache, apache-perl and xinet along the way and around that time I got assigned my job for the next 3 months or so. We, a 2 headed monkey uhm team, have to develop a trouble ticket system since <i>all the existing ones just <b>suck</b> bigtime</i>. Pick a language: perl. Pick a database: mysql. Requirements: plugin-ability, LDAP migrating possibilities later on, Text::Template, documented code, POD and loads of my perl books. We, uhm I, decided to go for mod_perl (since I really could use some new skills on that part). My co-worker is more of a Java junkie but I twisted his arm just enough for him to let me use perl on this one. I set up a simple CVS server and gave a quick tut on it. A few moments later we realized BA apparently didn't have UPSes in place and the power went down (someone blew up the coffee machine????). Thank god for the guy who installed that Debian for using ext3. I headed homewards around 5.30 PM, tired but satisfied with the first day. <br><br>
I called Ann, chatted a bit about school and holidays. I asked her about that clicking but she <i>apparently</i> didn't notice it altho I did hear it again as she hung up. Damn russians :)<br><br>I vectorized some Kanji to use as a wallpaper. Gotta love SVG.</p>

<h2>RT is really that bad?</h2>

Sure, it does use mason for its web front end but it offers just about everything else you mentioned, plus a couple things you didn't mention like:
<ul>
<li> community support (mailing list + used by CPAN!)</li>
<li> commercial support</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/" title="bestpractical.com">RT</a bestpractical.com>

<p>
Just something to consider, since most times I'd rather not write something from scratch, which is why I'm a lazy perl programmer.

I actually checked at RT, since I was browsing around existing ticket systems I knew. The italic was not my opinion ofcourse, but I have no experience when it comes to ticket tracking so I have no idea what is good and what is not. RT has proven it's effectiveness and in what way this local project will benefit from that is yet to be seen. Whichever way we eventually end up choosing, it'll be a fun ride<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>

<h2>Why not take-up development of RT?</h2>

Hey why not invest time in expanding RT? I'm not sure if you can get away with this @school, but it would make a nice case study about OSS, not?<br>
&nbsp; If I would be the prof I really would stimulate that idea<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

Well, I'm actually doing internship at a company<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) So whatever they decide, I have to stick to. I'm installing RT at home to get a hang of Ticket serving and I'll see how we'll do it at the company.  It's a linux shop and they're pretty pro OSS. Chances are that I can relase source code once we're done but it's still all a bit vague.  At the end of the week, we'll have  our first meeting with the supervisors about our technical, logical and funtional planning. More details then, I guess.
