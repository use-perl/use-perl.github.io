<p>Which LPI exam and certification? Was it easy? what did you do for preparation? Now you have had the certification for a while, was it any use?</p>

If you're a daily linux user, you should have no problems.. stuff like setting up internet connection, defining nameservers, package management, permissions, NFS, lilo. etc

<p>Ta, useful to know. I recently did the Red Hat Certified Technician course, and I've been running Linux servers for over 3 years, and Linux as my primary desktop for over 1 year - all self taught. I think I know some stuff, enough to see some of my knowledge blackholes, but not all of them.</p>

<p>More importantly, has it been of any use?</p>

I learned not much while preparing for the course but I've been using linux for the past 7 years or so. I only did level 1 but I assume level 2 would teach me something new. How did the RH exam go? Were there lots of sections where you felt you didn't prepare enough? AFAIK the level 1 LPI has a RH and a Debian version, the only difference being the section on package management. The thing that is stuck in my head is that they ask quite of bit of parameter questions. What the -p parameter does in netstat, what parameters to use in tar to gunzip etc. I'm not claiming LPI-less techies suck at using linux adn that all LPI certified ones know their shit, but having my LPI on my resume helped me during job interviews... and it showed I wasn't afraid to learn and grow professionally.

<p>I'm self taught, so what I know is very patchy. I've got a LPIC-1 book, and found that there is lots of stuff that I didn't know, but if I needed to know it stuff I'd read the man pages. I can see that it's helpful to have more in your head, than less, but sometimes there is no point in knowing every command line switch required to debug an modem.</p>

<p>The Red Hat course was quite interesting actually. I did know about 80% of the content, but you get a feeling for how they designed Red Hat, and how they expect it to be used. So rather than battling the product (I prefer Debian), I did find it easier to use afterwards.</p>

<p>The exam is very straight forwards, they give you a broken PC, and you need to fix it. Fail that and you fail the exam. Next they give you a blank PC, and a bunch of pseudo real world end points to reach. You do it how you want, and they only care about end results. Basically it's what their web site says. Obviously the tasks vary from test to test, but they cover all the basics.</p>

<p>For me I messed up one section, it was the one thing I'd never done in advance. However I found what I was looking for just before time was up, and I passed. Overall I'd say you need to know all your stuff to pass the Red Hat exam, they are quite upfront, eveything in the couse is on the exam (in some shape or form).</p>

<p>I'm hoping to do LPIC-I this year, because it's cheap, and it will be nice to have achieved something on my own. Plus I think LPCI and RHCE/RHCE are quite different and complementary.</p>

Most of the LPI exam is multiple choice and only a few are with text input fields. The LPI site has specs on what exactly you need to know for the exams so if you cover most of the manpages and HOWTOs mentioned (and perhaps google a bit where it's unclear), you should do fine.

<p>Ta, always useful to know. Once I've done my SAP training this spring, I'll have a go at LPI.</p>

<p>Interesting response, everyone else seems to hold it awe, either because of it's complexity and their inexperience with it, or because of their experience with it and the money they are making out of it...</p>

<p>So far I've had little exposure to it, but what I have seen is very odd, it doesn't look like anything I've used before.</p>
