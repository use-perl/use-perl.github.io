<p>I realize they sell cute toys, armoires anyone can put together and really good cinnamon rolls at Ikea.. Perhaps people get confused when they see a sweeeedish furniture store and think Ikea is sweeeedish for "Bring your relatives for a day of guaranteed fun!". To me, Ikea is just like any other store where you walk in, get what you want to buy, pay and walk out. Every time I go there, I have to wade through flocks of grandmas and colonies of little critters that vaguely resemble kids, dodge shopping carts that are  stuffed with flashy colored plastic spoons and knives and past the huge line at the information desk. For some people, reading 2 meter high aisle signs is still too difficult. There is a reason why they have midget pencils and tiny sheets of paper every 100 meters.. It's so you can write down the name of that couch you like (the one which name is guaranteed to be offensive in at least one language) so you don't have to spend 20 minutes asking the teenager in the standard issue blue vest about the bits and bobs on that multifunctional greenish-but-with-a-vaguely-blue-shine wastebasket you loved that matched the purple-ish toiletseat you got... *ARGH*</p>

<h2>Not just the UK then!</h2>

I'd got the idea this was just a British pasttime. The even more annoying bit though, is having to walk round the whole shop when you know what you want and can note it down in a few miuntes, then spend 20 minutes finding the till!
