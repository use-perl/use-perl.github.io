<p>Today I received a package in the mail. Someone I helped on #cgi a while ago really wanted to <i>repay</i> me so he sent me his used copy of <a href="http://books.perl.org/book/149">Perl Core Language Black Book</a>, written by Steven Holzner, published by the now defunct Coriolis Group. I can honestly say I never heard of the man altho he apparently wrote a number of Black Books. It's always nice to get a new perl book to add to my library. It's still strange that it's a used book. I don't know where that book has been before :|<br><br>Somehow I feel I really should clean up around the house :)<br><br>Another envelope in the mail: XML course at a local Uni (night school). I'm not coughing up &euro;1920 for that! I'll stick to my ORA books. I'm also not spending &euro;1500 for an e-security course at another Uni.<br><br>
For the past month, I've been trying to think of something else than the stuff that makes everything seem corny. I can't. For some reason I don't want to think of something else.<br><br>
Corny song quote coming up...<br><br>

I knew that would not last<br>
While trying to move forward<br>
I got caught up by the past<br>
All I did was get close to you</a></p>
