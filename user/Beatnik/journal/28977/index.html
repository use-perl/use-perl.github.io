<p>I had a dilemma.. My iPod Shuffle can hold about 512 meg worth of music. I don't plan on taking my laptop with me when I go snowboarding next week.. but I was planning on taking some music with me. My brother already solved that by uhm having me buy him an iPod Nano. Either I bought an iPod Nano myself, didn't take any music with me or took my laptop with me. Taking my laptop along is not an option. For one, it's a company laptop and I don't fancy dragging it along. I finally gave in and got myself a Nano as well.. Since my brother got a white one, I got a black one. If I get bored with the songs on my iPod, I can always just swap :)</p>

I'd prefer taking a company laptop with me instead of my own - if it gets stolen, it's not my loss. (And the company is insured). I usually take a laptop with me on vacation, not for the music, but for other reasons: I often combine my vacation with a Perl conference, and the laptop will hold my talks, and the laptop disk is much larger than the disks of my digital camera.
<p>
Unfortunally, the company I started working for last month doesn't give its employees a laptop. At least not it's IT employees. So I'll have to buy one myself.</p>

For one, there aren't any perl conferences in the French Alpes. The hassle I'll get for getting a new laptop up and running is probably not worth it. My digital camera has plenty of storage left to store the 50 or so pictures I'll take next week.<br> <br>The customer I work for recently decided that all external consultants get 'company' laptops.. which means I'll soon get another brand new laptop. (It's not really mine but I get to use it). I don't plan on ripping all my CDs to my iPod anytime soon so I'll manage just fine without a laptop<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
