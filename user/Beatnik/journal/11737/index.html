<p>Last night in my dreams...<br><br>
For some reason, a Hard Rock Cafe opened up in my block and we were able to attend some concerts and stuff by opening our back window and turning the couch a bit. Some rockers didn't find that funny. <br><br>In other news, I was able to fly <i>again</i>, my laptop had an extremly long battery life, I called 911 because some guy was in the river looking for his bike and we were playing golf from a hotel room near the Seine, in Paris, with loads of other people playing golf on the river banks. The room had a totally weird layout and there was a drilling hole to go the the center of the earth and my brother was jumping from bookcase to bookcase.<br><br>
Did I win the <i>Weirdest Dream Contest</i>??<br><br>
I had a really good talk with Ann last night. We really opened up and talked about practically anything. She's still one of my closest and dearest friends.<br><br>
Looks like I'll be attending a family meeting tomorrow, Easters Day.</p>
