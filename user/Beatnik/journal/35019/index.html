<p>Day 2 of Software Universe was a lot less hectic than the first one. Some of the guys attending recommended me going to see <a href="http://h40084.www4.hp.com/events/su2007/bio_pfeiffer.html?PHPSESSID=36baba0195be2d0149166d40fbead4f3">Ulrich Pfeiffer</a>. He showcased a lot of HP software products in a way that most companies normally don't use them. Previous years, he always made a grand entrace. This year, he skated on but rolled off on a pimped Segway. Pretty much everyone went to this keynote. Bad conference idea of the year: putting a cellphone number on the big screen and asking the crowd (4000+ people) to send a text message. The remaining hours was mostly spent in meetings or exhibition booth. They had Segway track and I took a few laps. (note to myself: Office event: <a href="http://www.segwayevents.be/">Segway events</a>). In between, I picked up a Windows Server 2008 evaluation CD at the Microsoft booth and fired up Boot Camp (and fscking up my partition table in the process - fix it by running Disk Utility after booting from the install CD). End conclusion: Windows Server 2008 does not install clean out of the box in Boot Camp :( The attendees diner was at a about 20 restaurants down at Barcelonetta. The Benelux attendees was all over one of the restaurants (and it's outside deck). Afterwards, some of us flooded an Irish bar and had some drinks (Wagners in my case, Mojitos for some of the other people). Long evening, short night, early morning.</p>
