<p>While I was sitting on the couch with my laptop on my uhm well lap, occasionally glancing over to the TV, I noticed a hedgehog near the back window. The window was open because of the heat so I could hear the leafs move. It was a pretty funny sight. It noticed me noticing and moved into the bushes.<br><br>
While sitting on the couch, I glanced at both the ending of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0114924">While you were sleeping</a>, another one of those corny comedy/romances and most of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0086058">The Osterman Weekend</a>, which actually sucks. I'm sure in 1983 it was a good movie.<br><br>
I spent most of my day today shopping.. or rather accompany someone who was shopping.. or rather accompany someone who was planning on doing some shopping but eventually didn't buy anything. But it was a nice day out none the less.</p>
