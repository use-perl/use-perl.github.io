<p>Well, today seemed like yet another day with a headache when I woke up this morning. Nothing could've prepared me for the things that were about to happen on this rainy November tuesday. After hearing no immediate response on that questionare, I decided to put together my own, less privacy-invading list of questions to send to that girl. I really knew about half the answers (which were the onces I was afraid of, really). I apparently came out alright... no marks of any physical abuse at all.. even my manhood untouched (WOW). What the outside world didn't see was that my worst fear (the stuff you always wanted to ask but always was afraid to), was confirmed... OR WAS IT??<br><br>Anyway, like a few journal entries before, I'm still stuck in the friend zone, and it looks like I'll be stuck here forever (well, my therapist suggested that I'd write this, to avoid me having any sudden outbursts of insanity).<br><br>The answers to those questions were funny, considerate and friendly (again, my therapist suggested that I put this here)... <font size="5"><b>AAAAAAAAARGH</b></font><br><br>
<b>Confession:</b><br>
For those who don't really get it by now, I'm feeling just fine, I'm pretty cool with what I know now, I don't have a therapist and I'm pretty capable of handling this uhm <i>ejectionRay</i> in a non-too-stressing way... (Oooh no, that Pig Latin came out totally WRONG! <b>:-)</b>). My life as a local geek goes on (who does in fact like Snowboarding, in case you are reading this!!), in an evertiring quest for uhm the holy grail???<br><br><b><font size="5">SOMEBODY BUY ME A BEER!!!!</font></b><br><br>
On yet another IT level, somehow it managed to escape my attention that my domain expired last thursday. I was planning on migrating it to a new DNS and stuff it all onto my new mailserver as well in a week or two. Due to current circumstances, DNS servers all over the world are syncronizing as we speak (<b>*g*</b>) and I should have my mail back in a day, tops. I really should buy a good friend a case of beer for hosting my stuff for the past 3 years. </p>
