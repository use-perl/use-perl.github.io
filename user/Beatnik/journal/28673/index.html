<p>Very short recap of the weekend: girlfriends niece held a Western themed birthday party (although there were plenty of mexicans too). I stuck with the blue jeans, a belt with oversized buckle and a straw hat. My girlfriend went Mexican. She wore a giant sombrerro (they don't come in small or medium it seems), a poncho, she dyed her hair black and stuck on a fake moustache. She actually looked quite nice with black hair. There was lots of Tequilla, spare ribs, chicken nuggets, something that resembled Chili con pollo (with wooden spoons) and some birthday cake. After getting home on sunday, I organised a field trip to the indoor ski slope nearby. 2 of the guys that went along are quite new at snowboarding but they're getting along very well. I raced one of my friends (he was wearing short skis, I was using my trusty old Santa Cruz board) and I won.. Afterwards, we had some mexican food at a place downtown. Most other restaurants were closed.</p>
