<p>I just saw Bowling for Columbine. I missed that in the theaters. It's really good; it has a pretty realistic view of american society.<br><br>
I think too much. Let it be known across the lands! <b>I THINK TOO MUCH</b>. Ofcourse I feel too much too :( which usually gets me in deep trouble. Those kinda trouble can't really be fixed without some sort of scar. I call this <i>The Learning Phase</i>. It's where I get hurt like hell a number of times and hope I'll learn fast enough not to do it again. It's like a little kid who grabs the toy connected to electricity and gets shocked, only more complex. Love is more complex. She is more complex. The toy isn't a toy but a girl, and a beautifull one too. This isn't something physical (if only it were that simple). It's not a fling either. I can't shut off my feelings from one day to the next. I'm not even sure I want to. Yes, my timing sucks. Not my fault. It's not like I have it under control. Sometimes I want to grab her and not let her go. When I walk over there, I'm noticeably relaxed and calm. It's really strange. The second I open that door, everything switches. This is all I think about. I'm trying to do the right thing but the right things seems to be the wrong thing once I did it.<br><br>Ole' blue eyes said it best:<br><br>
<i>And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like "I love you"<br><br><br>

Niemand weet waarom de zon nog schijnt<br>
Niemand weet waarom de kille wind nog waaien zou<br>
Maar ik weet dat ik van je hou<br>

<h2>dude, will you get laid already? :)</h2>

<p>You're killing me over here with all the cutesy, sappy, romantic stuff...:)</p>

I doubt I will in the near future<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:| But like I said, it's not something physical... If I wanted to get laid, I'd grab the first bimbo that flashed her boobs a bit too much.

<p>Well, I cringed but didn't say anything about the list of how to seduce a woman and have just noticed an increase in romanticism<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) You want to get laid, everyone does,  but with that steamer trunk of lofty sweetness it might be hard to get them all into the bed together<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Just because I think about sex all the time, doesn't mean sex is the most important thing in a relationship for me... and I don't just say that because the gorgeous in question is reading this as well. Women are mysterious, some women more than others but they all are. Women fall for romantic stuff... Just ask uhm uhm some woman you know<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D

<p>All women are different too<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I usually found romantic stuff rather cloying unless it was spontaneous and sincere. Just don't fall into the trap so many geek guys seem to, as well as many authors, where a woman is either on a pillar and virginal or a vile evil. Women aren't all that mysterious and usually want many of the same things in life you do, including sex.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Ofcourse. Everything in a relationship should be spontaneous altho a few things slip thru. I try to accept people (including women) as how they are, faults and everything. It's not realistic to think of someone as perfect. <i>This is the part where I tell you about one of my ex' who happens to be evil</i>. Altho one of my ex' wasn't perfect when we were together and was far from perfect when we broke up, she's still not pure evil... just 99% or so<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:P. Well, OK, she's not all THAT evil. She just has a rather bad personality. I just feel that women are not always how they seem to be. Average women are just as superficial as average men, women think about sex just as often as men.
