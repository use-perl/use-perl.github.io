<p>Today was talk #4. Actually it was talk #3 because it was rescheduled due to me not making the original appointment because of bad weather and traffic jams. The job opening was for Junior Java developer (it was either that or Junior .NET developer) but the recruiter noticed quite quickly I also loved perl very much. We mainly talked about non-technical stuff but we discussed most of the important issues. I almost saw her jaw fall off when she asked me for my current wages.. I responded that I wasn't picky but that I felt it was on the low side. She replied that most people think they're not making enough money.. A few seconds later she confirmed that I wasn't making enough money and promply suggested that I'd probably make about 70-80% more and had some cool benefits too. It was a very relaxed and friendly conversation and she gave me quite a few pointers on recruitment and job applications in general. I already have a second talk scheduled for sometime next week... One of her final remarks was that she felt like I had the right profile and attitude for working <i>here</i>.</p>
