<div class="span8">
<p>Delphi is not Perl.. which is pretty obvious ofcourse. Perl is more or less C like and Delphi is 99% Pascal. It's confusing that comments in Pascal are with curly braces and that is how Perl does blocks. Also, I take a lot of Perl functions for granted. It's not that Pascal is plain evil... It has been my language of choice for many years.. but it sometimes seems I can do the same in Perl is less than a third of the code. There doesn't appear to be move function, anywhere and removing /'s from a filename takes a function or 2. The event handling is really nice and I like the RAD part (although I generally feel RAD is all about raping the REAL programming languages where syntax is all that counts). There is a difference between functions and procedures and I expect variables to autocast when I need them to. I guess I'll get used to it again sooner or later.</p>

<p>I've been doing Gupta/Centura SQLWindows lately, and missing things like dynamic typing, array slices, hash arrays, regexes, etc.</p>
<p>And this is supposed to be one of the better GUI development environments<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) I'm still working on coming up with an overwhelming reason to get the ActiveState DevKit so I can at least develop some ActiveX libraries in perl to call from this environment. Even then some things will still be more cumbersome than just having it natively in the language.</p>
<p>But at least I've developed some perl utilities to deal with some things, so if any of the other developers want to use the utilities, they'll have to install perl...and then the world conquest will begin !!!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>
