<p>The weather in BE has been excellent for the past weeks. For some reason, I decided not to wear a shirt today and just stick to a T-Shirt (by accident, it was the YAPC::Eu Paris T-Shirt). A few things happened today that kinda took me by surprise. I don't work in a cubicle but somehow people do expect me to wear a shirt.. even though I wore one every day for the past 8 months and others haven't. My boss noticed that I was wearing a Perl T-shirt and questioned me about the whole thing. My boss wasn't the only one. I had a few conversations about Perl today. My boss is a big fan of Joomla!/Mambo. He wanted to know what my <i>speciality</i> in Perl was. We ended up having a nice long talk during coffee. One of the things that came up was wether or not I was doing all <i>this</i> for fun or profit. He asked me why I didn't join an existing initiative and help out. I explained my motives and similar projects. During the same coffee break, <i>the new guy</i> got introduced to all of us and I got labeled as <i>the perl geek</i> even though I don't do any perl stuff for work and I don't really talk about it that much. For lunch, I joined a co-worker at the american restaurant (finding fried chicken is pretty hard in BE). On a different topic, I got a Cisco lanyard from one of the Cisco consultants.. and when I got home, I got another Cisco lanyard sent to me by a close friend. </p>
