<p>Getting DJBDNS running on Debian isn't all the typical... I used the following to get it installed 
in a very limited setup.<br><br>
<code>apt-get install daemontools-installer<br>
build-daemontools<br>
apt-get install djbdns-installer<br>
build-djbdns<br>
dnscache-conf dnscache dnslog /var/dnscache<br>
cd /var/lib/svscan; ln -s ../../dnscache .<br>
echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" > /etc/resolv.conf<br>
echo "domain example.com" >> /etc/resolv.conf # or your domain<br>
cat > /etc/pump.conf <<EOF<br>
device eth0 {<br>
nodns<br>
}<br>
EOF

<p>DJB is known for having very interesting, radical and useful ideas about software.  He has his own (quite sensible) ideas about how a filesystem should be layed out.  Trouble is and they conflict with just about everyone else.  This wouldn't be so bad if he didn't <a href="http://cr.yp.to/distributors.html" title="cr.yp.to">make redistribution a living hell</a cr.yp.to>.  To sum up: you cannot distribute a binary package of DJB's work unless it installs exactly the way he wants to in exactly the same locations.  This is supposed to make life easier on bug reporting, DJB knows exactly how everything is configured.

</p><p>Debian also have some very strong ideas about how a filesystem should be layed out.  They tend to rework applications so their binary packages install to certain locations which provides some consistency.  When Debian meets DJB, sparks fly.  The result: the user loses.  Debian must distribute DJBware as source packages only resulting in an extra unnecessary step in the installation process.  This makes updating DJBware harder than it should be resulting in exactly the opposite result than what DJB wanted: users will use old, buggy, insecure versions of his software.

</p><p>In the end its a classic example of a designer having a good idea and then trying to force it on the entire universe by ignoring extenuating circumstances.  Normally such people are punished by their product not being used but in DJB's case his software is so good (or the competition, bind, is so bad) that folks are willing to put up with the licensing shenanigans.

</p><p>About the only worse example is MPlayer.</p>
