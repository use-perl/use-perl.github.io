<p>I have a rather long backlog of journal posts.. so this post is actually a few weeks old. I bumped into the following problem..<br><br>
In a web based file manager (yes, I know, doom doom doom doom), I had a javascript popup (again, I know, doom doom doom doom) with a upload form. The submit button submitted the form and closed the popup. It turned out that the closing of the popup caused the uploading procedure to cut off. Uploading worked fine for some files and failed for others. After moving the upload form away from the popup, everything worked fine.<br><br>
Let this be a lesson to all: Don't mix funky javascript with funky javascript and file uploading! :D</p>

This one took me months to track down. I had added some javascript to a form submit button that set it to dlsabled=true during the onclick event; so clicking it multiple times did nothing.<br><br>This was all fine and good until we started getting errors due to Content-Length being 0 on a form post.<br><br>As it turns out, the browser in CompuServe7 (yes, people are still using that crap) would send absolutely no content during a form post when the submit button was disabled. Eeek.
