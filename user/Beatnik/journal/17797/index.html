<p>
I'd be a lot more comfortable if she was the one taking it.  I'll probably just get bigger boobs, no?</p>

Ah, I can see now that 43% of those surveyed were MEN.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>

<i>You're single. At a reception, you meet a stranger to whom you are attracted. He/she offers having a one-night stand.

<br> <br>
That makes sense, sleeping for money is prostitution, something most people don't want to get into, while a hypothetical one-night stand with someone to whom you are attracted is a common fantasy.

And the one night stand question stated "You are single".
