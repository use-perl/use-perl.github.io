<p>A few days ago (I confess I was under a lot of stress at the time), some managers asked me a question to which I had no answer.. I had no answer because the question was totally out of my project scope.. I responded with "42"... which obviously didn't match the question. I tried explaining what 42 was all about but somehow I got the feeling they didn't grasp the whole 'the earth is not a planet but a supercomputer ruled by mice to discover the question concerning life, the universe and everything, to which the answer is 42' concept. I didn't try explaining any further "especially not about the art of flying and, most importantly, about the intentionally missing the ground when falling. Oh well.</p>

If they don't understand the answer they really won't understand the question.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
