<p>Nothing could've prepared me for what I was about to experience today... Well, not really true, a 5 minute briefing could and it actually did but I didn't realize it until it hit me in the face... Well, I actually did realize quite early on so that's not true either... Anyway, it was a busy day.<br><br>We had a camera crew coming over around 4.30 PM so we had some preparing to do. I basically had 4 jobs. First off, I had to grab some virus toolkits off the net, check if they were any good and how they worked... Next I had to grab sources of top 5 virusses of the net, read thru it and summarize a bit. This also included my next job, which was to check Anti-Virus sites on virus description and make a one page summary of those virusses. My final job was to make a quick script and accompanying HTML files to allow visitors to enter details so we could audit their mail server. Ofcourse, half way through my morning, I was called in to install linux on 2 Dell 1U boxes and since the owner really wanted to know what I installed and why, it took a bit longer. He is a nice guy though. By the time the setup asked for the second disk, I was in the car.. driving around buying some pots and plants, coffee and water and some sweets.. and ofcourse my lunch. Eating a grilled sandwich while selecting packages to install is not good for the appetite. Anyway, I more or less managed to complete most of my jobs by the time the camera crew arrived. They were interviewing my boss on, go figure, the whole virus episodes. Later on, they needed some fancy shots of desktops and were particulary interested in some X screensavers. You can see XMatrix in there for sure. After some takes and retakes, they finally left at around 6.30 and we headed home.<br><br>
A new show on TV, although it's been done before, is "Olivier De Rijcke". Some poor schmuck is looking for a wife and agrees to meet up with 15 beautifull women. The only catch is that they believe he is a millionaire and just inherited 32 million euro (and a castle ofcourse). I can't help but see a lot of resemblance between a girl on that show, Lore, and one of my friends...<br><br>
In the mean time, I still have to migrate some site to a new formatting.. *SIGH* No rest for thw wicked!</p>
