<p>I work in an IT company.. a fairly big, international IT company. You know IT, right? It's computers and shit. I'm still baffled each and every time someone does a <i>reply to all</i> trick. Especially if you notice that the sender specified dozens of recipients manually.. That alone should raise some flags. I tested it to make sure it wasn't accidental. Someone actually went out of it's way to reply to all. It's like they want you to laugh at them in public! Corporate policy doesn't allow me to post a picture or a name but I would if I could! :)</p>

<h2>Mail storms</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2006-07-10T13:53:25</h3>
<p>We have been having what I call "mail storms," lately.  Somebody within the company (1000+ employees) sets up some kind of a mailing list that includes apparently everyone in the company, somehow somebody gets a message from it (often a message letting them know they've subscribed -- thanks!) and replies saying, "What's this?"  And then mail goes down for a day.</p>

<p>The time before last that this happened I hunted down the URL of the mailing list (it was mailman), found out how to unsubscribe, and told everybody.  Then I spent the rest of the day receiving nasty messages telling me what a piece of human excrement I was for replying to all and trying to be helpful.  I turned Outlook off entirely for the last hour of the day, and went home on time instead of staying late to finish the project I'd been working on.</p>

<p>The next time I left it alone.  This time the mailing list was also on Exchange, so apparently it was much quicker and easier to get the ability of everybody to post to the list turned off.</p>
