<p>After walking around Paris for quite a while, we finally found <i>La Taverne</i> were a whole bunch of other people already had their appetizers. By the time we got to our main course, the talks already started :|<br><br>
In the afternoon, I watched MJD do his 'Tricks of the Wizard' talk, followed by his 12 lightning talks in 60 minutes. While listening with just one ear, I worked a bit on my talk. I'm sure I can release something on CPAN later today. After MJDs talk, my roommate and myself didn't really know what to do next. We bumped into [virtualsue], [advocate], [corion] and 2 <i>monks</i> who's monk name I don't really know. We agreed to meet at their hotel later and to walk around town... and so we did. We visited <i>la plage</i> near the Seine, which is lovely lit late at night.<br><br>and yes, I do have some unique pictures of the otherwise camerashy [advocate] for sale.. :P<br><br>
When we got back to the hotel, we talked a bit. Waking up with Parisien traffic noises is not all that pleasant so I was wide awake by 6 AM.. which is <b>NOT</b> funny!<br><br>
Day 2 of the conference is about to start. I'll spend most of my time in the O'Reilly room today, I guess.</p>
