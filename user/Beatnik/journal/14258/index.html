<p>well, not really full of surprises...<br><br>
I got a new chair. While I was gone on a customer call, someone replaced my old chair with a new one... Yipeee.<br><br>On the cultural side of things, belgian archaeologists have uncovered a large large fountian (almost brand new condition :p) and some large statues of emperor Hadrian in Sagalassos, Turkey. Official site is <a href="http://www.sagalassos.be/">here</a>, virtual tour is <a href="http://www.archaeology.org/interactive/sagalassos/index.html">here</a>. I know SOME people that are rather excited right now (partly because they're studying at the same department of the same university as the people currently at the dig site)<br><br>A random conversation with my boss... Topic: Turn-offs (with women ofcourse). His: Smoking (although he claims to look past that) and certain types of shoes (think 3 inches). Mine: (mentally, emotionally and financially) dependenant and <a href="href="http://thesaurus.reference.com/search?q=scruffy">scruffy</a> people. Ofcourse mentally (or emotionally) unstable, suicidal are also turn-offs. Smoking is not really on my list but I do appreciate some consideration :)<br><br>
<b>Warning!</b> Purely poetic moment coming..<br><blockquote>
You were in my dreams last night<br>
I was holding you close and tight<br>
I didn't want to let you go<br>
I didn't want to miss you so<br><br>
You looked into my eyes so deep<br>
I wish I didn't sleep<br>
I couldn't say a word<br>
My heartbeat was all I heard<br><br>
I wish what I dreamt was true<br>
Because then I'd be close to to you<br>
Later, when I turn off the light,<br>
I hope to see your eyes so bright.</blockquote></p>
