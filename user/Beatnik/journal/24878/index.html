<p>I got 2 parking tickets today.. for standing in the same spot. We have this system where you indicate at what time you arrive and you're entitled for 2 hours on that spot. Normally, after 2 hours, you have to move your car (but usually we just change the indicator) so I went to my car this afternoon (15 minutes late) and found a parking ticket under my windshield wipers. I took the ticket with me to the office (after changing the indicator). When I got back to my car (30 late this time), there was another one. The first ticket suggested the fine was 25 euros (since the ticket wasn't filled in completly). The second one was a totally different type. I think there are rules for this stuff. Isn't it illegal to get fined twice for the same booboo? </p>

<h2>You took the ticket off...</h2>

At least in Portugal there are rules for that, yes.

<p>But even if there are similar rules there, the fact that you removed the ticket from the car might have led a different cop to issue another ticket, as he wouldn't know about the first one... right?

</p> <p>Get a fake ticket and leave it on the windshield permanently O:-)</p>

it's from the same cop. The city isn't swarming with ticket-writing cops. The fake ticket idea is pretty cool... but I'm not sure how the cops will react when they discover that it's not a genuine one. I can't fake their signature.. uhm legally<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D

<h2>indicator</h2>

In Toronto the way they test for vehicles parking too long is to come by once and put a chalk mark on the tires of all the cars parked on the street, then come back some time after the maximum duration has passed and give a ticket to any car with a chalk mark.  So, you had to physically move the car to "change the indicator".<p>
Much, if not all, parking has changed from time-limited to paid parking in recent years, though.  That came about as a financial issue, first because the city was looking for money, and second because they found that putting a couple of ticket issuing boxes on every block was a lot cheaper than putting a meter box on every parking slot (so there was a lower hardware cost to start metering and it was cheaper to collect money from two boxes than 20 per block, as well as the new boxes being able to take credit and debit cards).</p>
