<p>I took the Thalys to Paris this morning at 7.10 AM. The people sitting next to me were looking pretty funny when I grabbed my laptop from my backpack and started working a bit. An hour and a half later, the train stopped in Paris Gare du Nord. I rushed out of the train and into the metro pit... *OUCH* a rather long queue for the ticket desk. After standing on a packed metro cart for about 5 minutes, I get off at Strasbourg-St. Denis. After asking directions from some friendly parisiens, I arrive at the hotel. The man behind the desk is looking quite confused when I tell him I have a reservation and I end up getting out my laptop to show him the email, since my printer was still b0rked.  I stuffed my suitcase in a small room and run over to the CNAM. Jouke is standing guard outside and points me in the right direction.  <br><br>There is a rather large queue at the registration desk too so I decide to skip that for now and just jump into the O'Reilly room for the intro talk. No sign of my roommate yet. Intro talk done, no schedule in sight. I hop into another room and notice I'm in Nick Clark's talk on optimizing (which I already saw last year) so I hop back out. Another shot... Fotango room: Stas Bekman explaining mod_perl2. Interesting. My extra battery comes in handy but wireless connection drops occasionally. <br><br>During the first break, I bump into my roommate and some other friends. I decide to queue for registration and after a short while, I get my XL sized T-Shirt, a few minutes later my goodie bag and again a few minutes later my badge. Due to technical difficulties, the picture on my badge isn't the one I send in on the site. Break is over and I head back into the Fotango room. Stas is still there... I get out my laptop power supply and start charging. While I'm working on my lightning talk slides, moving scrabble tiles around, Elaine Ashton passes and notes those are quite <i>cute</i>. Talk is almost over :|</p>

We didn't use the photos that people upload on the yapc::eu site becuase <i>most of them were very very silly indeed</i>...
