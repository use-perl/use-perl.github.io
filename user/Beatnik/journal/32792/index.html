<p>One of the benefits of working where I'm working is that there are plenty of facilities about. One of my co-workers took me to the pool on a try-dive a few days ago. We first went to get (what he called) a kit at the diving club shack: a big-ass bottle of compressed air, an inflatable vest, some flippers, a mask and something that resembles half a squid. I picked up a cheap pack of T-shirts at the on-site supermarket. The actual diving was a bit scary at first. I panicked a few times and inflated my vest to get to the surface ASAP.. By the end of the dive, which lasted about an hour and a half, I was getting used to breathing through my mouth. I still haven't quite figured out the "getting rid of the pressure on your eardrums" ritual, which involves pressing your nostriles slightly and breathing out through your nose (it's harder than you think with a breathing apparatus stuck in your mouth.. try it). I'm considering taking classes but I'll probably need to have a physical examination done first. </p>

I really really enjoy diving and I'd recommend you try it with a set of courses in the pool and then some nice diving in warm water. MMmmmm, SCUBA.
