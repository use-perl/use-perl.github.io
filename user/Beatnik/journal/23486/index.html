<p>This evening, I signed a new employment contract. My old one ends next wednesday and I've been busy looking for a decent job for the past 3 months (only actively for the past month or so). In my quest for a new workplace, I found a local consulting shop that specializes in SLA tools and stuff. They have a pretty strict confidentiality policy so I won't post anything work related here but it all seems quite nice. There will be tons of certification, some int'l work, fair wages (40%-50% raise comparing with my current position), company car, cell phone and tons of extras. I'm starting the 16th.. Now all I have to do is finish of some projects at my current job, stand in the unemployment line for about a week (since I won't get pension for this month if I don't) and tie up some loose ends with recruitement offices and other companies that were all more or less interested in talking to me again. I'll have the week (more or less) off so I'll clean up the house, sleep in late, party, code tons (hopefully squeeze out a release of my all time favorite CMS *cough*) and read up on stuff that might come in handy with my new employer...</p>

and don't forget to buy a false beard and some sunglasses - they are used by all the better secret agents as a way of recognition.
