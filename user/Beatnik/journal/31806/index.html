<div class="span8">
<p>On saturday, I took my girlfriend shopping (or rather, she pushed me into taking her shopping). She wanted to go to the mall so I parked my car on the parking lot of nearby store to avoid the traffic jam on the mall parking lot (or rather, she urged me to park my car on the parking lot nearby). On the walk back to the car (around 7'ish), I jokingly noted that we'd be screwed if the parking lot was closed... Oh boy, wish I could rewind that one. My girlfriend started panicking because (you guessed it) the parking lot was indeed closed. My girlfriend had the evening shift and she was already picturing herself not making it to work in time (we *only* had 2 hours left). We ended up taking the bus home and (obviously) my girlfriend made it to work in time. I picked up the car the next morning. I think she'll be hearing about this one for quite a while to come.</p>

<h2>Drop It</h2>

Unless you plan on breaking up with her soon then trust me on this one and just drop it.  I know it's hard to do especially if you end up in an argument.  If you can pull it off then it'll pay off in the long run.  Guys have a tendency to get themselves into enough trouble on our own without bringing up shortcomings in their girlfriend or wife.
