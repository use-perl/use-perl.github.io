<p>Yesterday evening, while on route to pick up my girlfriend, I had an accident with my car. A teenager on a moped crashed into the passenger side of my car when I was making a turn to the left. The boy was still using a learners permit and, so it seemed to me, was unable to brake. The front windshield is crashed, the chassis above my right front tire has some major dents and the hood is slightly scratched. I couldn't open the front passenger side door. Most importantly, the teenager only has minor injuries. The ambulance took him away for a check up. I was making the turn when I noticed the moped coming and I slammed the breaks... I assume he would have smashed my side window if I hadn't. The moped had a smashed front tire. The accident occured only 100 meters from the place where I was going to pick up my girlfriend. She rushed over and found me shaking. The teenager called his parents stating that someone just ran him over (I had to force myself to shut up for a second when he said that, as it actually was the other way around). The parents arrived pretty soon afterwards and were, all things considering, pretty relaxed. I called my boss and the insurance and a tow truck picked up the car just when the police took my statement. I still don't have a clue how the accident could have happened. The innersection (traffic lights included) is twice as large as a normal innersection and my car was pretty much standing still when the collision occured. I didn't have to take an alcohol test because the police officer couldn't find the machine. It would have returned a negative result anyway. My indicator and headlights were on. I doubt the police asked around for witnesses altough there were at least 30 people standing about. The parents of the moped kid took the moped along. I'm sure there hasn't been a technical review yet. One of the police officers I talked to this morning stated that the first officers on the scene usually decide weither a technical review is needed. The images have been haunting through my mind all night long.<br><br>Thank you for being part of my therapy, dear blog.</p>
