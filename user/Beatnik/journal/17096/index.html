<p>For some reason I've been extremly calm the past 3 weeks or so when it comes to code. I've got a good reason for this ofcourse... It's one of those XX creatures. Since I'm an XY creature, I must follow my animal instincts that force me to have extremly long, friendly, deep, intriguing conversations. Did I mention the tons of email exchanges yet?? Oh, I did now.. OK.</p>

<h2>Does That Really Work?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2004-01-30T05:11:13</h3>
<p>I mean, having an X chromosome and a Y chromosome myself, I can't imagine that vague references, ahem, hrm, to this or, kaff, that in a public journal would endear you to a human being possessing double X chromosomes.  Then again, I'm not Belgian, I'm rather too old to act cute, and I generally tend to keep my private life private so there you go.</p>

<p>On the other hand, sometimes hfb teases you about it, and that's always fun to see.</p>

Well,  she doesn't read this journal AFAIK. Besides, it would be extremly indiscrete to post entire chatlogs and email threads here<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Belgian women and men are quite different is practically anything actually<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Think Dr Evil, webbed feet.<br> <br>hfb is the only one who can do that... Yes, she can feel special now (but not TOO special, since she also has  2 X')

<h2>Talk about yo'feelings till...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ybiC/">ybiC</a> on 2004-01-31T15:50:48</h3>
I'm reminded of the line from Two Weeks Notice* where the chauffer says something like "<i>being in a dating relationship means having to talk about your feelings until your life is sucked out yo' body</i>".
<p>
Heh. Thankfully, my wife and I were close friends for several years before dating, so I pretty much got to skip that step.

Yes, I know, it wasn't exactly an all time classic movie. But Sandra Bullock is a hotty. What can I say.
