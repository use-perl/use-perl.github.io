<p>I'm pretty soaked since I walked home from the theater where they played Memento. I actually didn't care about getting all wet. Memento is a pretty good movie, a bit weird on the side. For those who didn't see it, Guy Pearce is looking for the guy who raped and killed his wife. The only problem is that he has no short term memory and therefor can't remember what happened yesterday or an hour ago (I do). I'd recommend it! I'm sure I'll have loads to think about... not just about the movie<br><br>She smelled like Cool water and looked like a million stars <i>*sigh*</i>. For some reason, I didn't want to leave.<br><br>
Work went quite smoothly altho I spent quite a bit on adding uploading features in a mod_perl thing. I cursed quite a lot. Not to mention the swearing I did while installing a Terminal Service server (both hard- and software) and getting it hooked up to a switch that acted <b>REALLY</b> strange.<br><br>
I did some basic graphics for my talk in paris. I really need to get a basic paper draft ready. I already added loads of comments in my slide so distilling the draft shouldn't be a problem.
