<h2>Autopsy</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2003-06-16T23:16:54</h3>
<p>Okay, I'll bite.  What the heck is the "Alien Autopsy"?  Is this some freaky ritual I've never heard of or is this a test to see if anyone reads your journal?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>And on a related note:  that reminds me of one of my favorite news gaffes.  Several times I've heard newscasters announce (with a straight face no less) that "an autopsy was performed to determine the cause of death".</p>

<p>It makes me want to scream!  Why <em>else</em> would you perform an autopsy?!</p>

the people sitting in the van outside said I should deny everything and they made me turn in the contents of my refridgerator. Damn you people for stealing my popsicles!



<h2>Several Reasons!</h2>

<ul>
<li>Cheap meat</li>
<li>Biodegradable insulating material</li>
<li>Life-like puppets</li>
<li>Inexpensive Halloween decorations</li>
<li>Retrieve your watch from a botched surgery</li>
</ul>

<p>... and that's just off the top of my head, no pun intended.</p>

<h2>Several More Reasons</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The foil hat didn't work.</li>
  <li>The radios in the teeth did.</li>
  <li>Souvenir from Area 51a.</li>
  <li>Declassified Roswell docs had some extra documents not blacked out.</li>
  <li>Xenu _did_ live.</li>
  <li>Kodos and Kang came over for a bbq and the steaks might have been Canadian</li>
</ul><br/><br/>I could go on but I really must continue surfing...

It would often be to determine the circumstances of death, and the cause of death is only one facet of those.  Learning about events prior to death (bit not directly causing the death) can be very important too. (rape, injury, sedation, intoxication, etc.)

In addition, when someone says "an autopsy was performed to determine the cause of death," it is often a way to imply that the cause of death was unknown and note that an autopsy was performed.  e.g., a reporter could say, "the cause of death was not known, so an autopsy was performed," but that seems clumsy to me.  So they could say, "the cause of death was not known; to determine it, they performed an autopsy," but that is too wordy, etc.
