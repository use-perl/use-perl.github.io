<div class="span8">
<p>My SE t630 showed me some SIM error messages last week and it shut down completely once or twice as well. It seemed like a good idea to get a new cell phone before my old one completely broke down. I stuck to SE and found the <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=gb&lc=en&ver=4000&template=pip1&zone=pp&pid=10242">k750i</a>, which was within budget range and had all the bits and bobs I wanted. I used my PDA as a temporary storage for my contacts. Sending them to my PDA wasn't a problem but sending them from my PDA to the new phone caused some problems. The phone would just soft-reset and no contact was saved. In the end, I just used the PC synchronization approach (although that still didn't work as well as I had hoped).<br><br>Short review of the phone:  It has a 2 mega pixel camera, which is nice but not truly important with a phone. The lens is protected by a slideable lens cap (which I suspect will be the first thing to break). It also includes a 2 LED light near the lens. I was surprised how big it's effect is. It has a bigger display than my old t630 and weighs slightly more. The buttons are a small improvement since the t630 had rounded buttons. This one has smooth, softer buttons. It also includes a USB cable, a headphone/headset (including antenna for the radio), a memory slot (for small Sony sticks). It plays MP3s and AACs and ringtone and plays very nicely with Linux. I plugged it in, icon appeared, dragged some music to the MP3 folder etc voila.</p>
