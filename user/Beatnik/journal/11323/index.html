<p>An alternative version...<br><br><br><br/><br/><b>Morpheus:</b> Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something.
What you know you can't explain. But you feel it. You've felt it your entire life. That there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is but it's there, like a splinter in your mind driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I'm talking about? <br><br><br/><br/><b>Neo:</b> Love?
<br><br>
<b>Morpheus:</b> Do you want to know what it is? Love is everywhere. It is all around us, even now in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
<br><br>
<b>Neo:</b> What truth?<br><br><br/><br/><b>Morpheus:</b> That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage, born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch. A prison for your mind.... Unfortunately, no one can be told what love is. You have to see it for yourself. This is your last chance. After this there is no turning back. You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes... Remember, all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more... 
<br><br><br>I'll take the red pill, please...<br><br>*ARGH*My external mailserver is down for some reason :(</p>
