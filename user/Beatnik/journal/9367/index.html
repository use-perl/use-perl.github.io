<p>To skip all the excitement during the past days (the backrub, the infamous Bond vs women discussion, the feeling sick and the spine dev), this is a short report of the first Aarschot.PM meething (probably also the last, but more on that in a minute). We met around 8 PM at <a href="http://www.knoet.be">"De Knoet"</a> in Aarschot. Short list of attendees (random order) :<ol>
<li>Stefaan Colson</li>
<li>Elizabeth Mattijsen</li>
<li>Friend of Liz, whose name I for some reason forgot.. <b>Sorry!</b></li>
<li>Stefan Verhoeff</li>
<li>Johan Van den Brande</li>
<li>Mark Ceulemans</li>
<li>Geert Theys ofcourse</li>
<li>Me</li></ol>
Karl Moens couldn't make it due to schedule.<br>
After some getting-to-know-each-other talk, we discussed how Aarschot.PM's future might be and we agreed to change it's name to Vlaanderen.PM (or something similar, let's flip a coin), to appeal to a wider audience (also because none of use actually lives in Aarschot anymore). Liz and her friend talked a bit about how other PM's do meetings and talks. There even is an abstract on the PM site (<a href="http://www.pm.org/successful/index.html">Perl Mongers: How to run a successful group</a>) so we'll be looking into this orga stuff some more. 
We discussed possible locations for more technical talks and maybe a permanent place to hold the meetings. I'll check with school but I'm sure I can get a hold of a room pretty easily. We'll discuss stuff in the mailing list. We're always welcoming new members so join in if you want!<br><br>BTW <b>Congrats Johan</b>, with that first child coming up. and <b>Thanks Mark</b> for the ride.<br><br>
And now, a short update on the other news:<br>
Best friend got back from United Arab Emirates; got a backrub from the curly girl on thursday (even tho I was feeling sick all day and I went to bed early that evening), had a <i>How James Bond movies really are sexist</i> discussion, also with the curly girl. SPINE dev is going oki (for now), wrote a SPINE::Plug::RandomPic plugin today. I have NO idea when I'll do a final release but I might just do a pre-release by x-mas :)</p>
