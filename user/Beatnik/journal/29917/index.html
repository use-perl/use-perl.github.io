<p>I'm taking my girlfriend to Disneyland in Paris in a few weeks. I'm not sure how to interpret the reply I got from a friend: <br><br><cite>I also find amusement  parks very romantic ... there is something so sweet about an adult turning into a 10 year old kid :-)</cite><br><br>I confess.. I'm a 27 year old kid when it comes to wild rides, video games and toys (uhm gadgets). Now, all I have to do is convince my girlfriend to take the Space Mountain ride with me :)</p>

<h2>Do it!</h2>

I took my (now) wife to Disneyland Paris for her 30th.  We had a whale of a time.  It's just about enjoying something together.

My advice -- get there as early as possible and pre-book all the rides you can.

<h2>Disney is not just for kids anymore</h2>

Not done? Recent business press reports indicate that a significant percentage of patrons at Walt Disney World in Florida are childless couples.<br><br>(With the Florida resort complex including "Downtown Disney" nightclub zone, there's an increasing number of young-adult singles floating around too.)<br><br>Your "friend" should try it before dis(mis)sing it. As much fun as Disney can be with a kid, I rather enjoyed taking an afternoon or evening with my wife while the daughter was with Aunt or Grandparents.<br><br>Enjoy. As Feynman taught us to say, "What do you care what other people thing?"<br>
