<p>Visit to the Museo Nazionale Napoli and planned visit to the Vesuvius (which got cancelled due to a small forest fire). The Museum has some plaster casts of Pompei and skeletonss from Encolarno. There was (and probably still is) a nice exhibit going on about villages destroyed by the eruption of the Vesuvius. Encolarno was covered with mud (we didn't visit Encolarno) and Pompei was covered with ashes. There are are rooms full with busts, statues and cabinets filled with jewels, armor etc. There are also dozens of fresco's and mosaics including the famous Alexander the Great and Darius at the battle of Issus mosaic and the Cave Canem (beware of the dog) mosaic. There is also a <i>secret room</i> where all erotic art is stashed. There are quite a lot of fallus shaped symbols (which apparently were used to keep evil out and luck inside). There are also some frescos from the pompei bordellos so men knew which door to pick for which <i>speciality</i>.</p>
