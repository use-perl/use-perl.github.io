<p>I lured my girlfriend into giving snowboarding a try. We drove over to the local indoor ski centre and I learned her some basics. She was pretty tired but happy after about an hour. She wants to try it again later.<br><br>Dad got back from Mexico this morning so the house was still pretty chaotic. In between his unpacking, I'm packing. I'm leaving for a week long training tomorrow and I still have tons of other stuff to do before I can go.<br><br>During one of my trips down memory lane, I rememberd how I learned some graphics programming in the mid 1990s by reading the <a href="http://www.hornet.org/code/tutors/denthor/">VGA tutorials by <i>Denthor</i> from a south african demo group called <i>Asphyxia</i></a>. A few of the tutorials used a very simple graphics format called "CEL". <a href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/mxr/gfx/anim/FLC.txt">CEL</a> was a format used by Autodesk's Animator software as a simple way to store sprites. The CEL format was pretty simple. It contained a 64 byte header, a 756 byte palette and a 64000 byte image data section. The image data was basically a raw dump of the 320*200 pixel data that was <i>back then</i> allocated at $a0000 (the MCGA video memory). It's been a while since I did any C coding and I'm somehow feeling like writing a C library for linux to support that graphics module (although it has been deprecated for ages) and add a Perl module on top.</p>
