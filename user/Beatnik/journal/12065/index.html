<p>I got up too late this morning so I rushed out the door without having breakfast and wearing a baseball cap to hide my <i>bad-hair-day</i> hair (I'm sure my <i>stylist</i> will shoot me for wearing that cap on a shirt). As usual on wednesdays, we went out for french fries (and not freedom frieds since I still live in that <b>OTHER</b> part of the free world). I got loads of work done today and if everything goes well, we'll finish up by friday and start testing and finish documenting it all. As usual on wednesday (altho I always seem to miss the opportunity), I gave Ann a call and we talk til one of us has to go. Today's call lasted for nearly an hour but we could go on for hours. I really enjoy our talks and I wouldn't know what to do without her. Apparently she had an appointment with her chiropractor today and she's still in loads of pain. I bought her birthday present today and it's still fun to tease her with it :) I still have to get Annika's present but I'll do that sometime next week. </p>
