<p>I always know I was stuck with Murphy's Law for life... I never knew it could do THAT :(  (Mmmm looks like a perl Ad). Anyway, how are things with that girl? I met up with her and her friends for a drink and noticed she brought along her newfound boyfriend (which is kinda OUCH). Last week I had a massage session with her rescheduled to this week, same time (being today) but today I checked my roster and realized I couldn't make it there on time (definitly OUCH). So I'll just send her a text message and see how we go from there. The good news, if that's what you can call it, is that she talked to her friend who in turn talked to me. The friend says she's not really together with that guy but she's only really really friendly (OUCH??). Anyway, I'm stuck not knowing what to do :]<br><br>
On the Perl side of things :) I got a first full working release of the P2P system. Still needs to tune it up a bit, secure it too :) but I'm guessing I'll get an A for this one.</p>
