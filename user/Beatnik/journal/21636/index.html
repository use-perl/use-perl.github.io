<p>Not choosing any side on the presidentials here (although I have my favourite) but this is worth mentioning. There was a documentary on TV about how TV stations have political power and abuse it (how ironic). The example mentioned was how Fox News was used by R. to move things their way. Although all of this might be biased, it's still quite freaky. For some reason R. TV stations started calling Kerry French (as in <i>Parlez-Vous Fran&ccedil;ais</i>). Not sure why but it seems quite strange. I'd be insulted if I were french :) (that would also be the case if Bush was called French ofcourse)<br><br>In other news, apparently Arnie got appointed as warden of Iraq (perhaps as part of the next step of his movie career??).<br><br>Retirement age was raised to 82....<b>82</b>. Comparing to the retirement age in Belgium (65), 82 is pretty high :)<br><br>
It might show I watched <i>Fahrenheit 9/11</i> again last night :) </p>

Fox News is slanted to the "right," certainly.  But CBS and ABC are slanted clearly to the "left," at least as much.  CNN is not far, but decidedly, left.  NBC/MSNBC is slightly left, IMO.<br> <br>Yes, Roger Ailes, the head of Fox News, is on the right.  And most of the heads of CBS and ABC are on the left.<br> <br>Many people try to make a big deal out of this.  People on the right bash ABC and CBS.  People on the left bash Fox News.  Both sides say their side is balanced, and the other isn't.<br> <br>I eschew all of them, for the most part.  My national TV news of choice is PBS News Hour.
