<p>I woke up feeling relieved. The spine release is something I've been working on for a while and I'm happy with the current state (going for mod_perl instead of CGI) and the development speed (I somehow produced about 10,000 lines of code in less than 3 months; the CGI version had about 4,000 lines in last release, which took a few years to achieve). mod_perl development is tr&egrave;s cool in my book.
<br><br>I bumped onto <a href=""http://www.scummvm.org/>ScummVM</a> and grabbed my copy of Day of the Tentacle. <b>SWEET</b> Nice voice syncro, normal game-play. Now all I need to do is buy a copy of Full Throttle on ebay.<br><br>
It's trailer time: Underworld seems nice (Kate Beckinsale in a tight black leather outfit *ROOAAR*), Tomb Raider is on my list (Angeline Jolie in a tight white outfit *ROOAAR*), Charlies Angels: Full Throttle (Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu, Drew Barymore in a uhm...). I see a pattern here...<br><br>
if ($trailer =~ /(tight|outfit)/) { ... }</p>

<p>Are you an equal opportunities <i>*ROOAAR*</i>er? Your code as is will trigger on male leads in tight outfits. Not that this is wrong, just that it's not consistent with a subtle trend I noticed in your examples. This is what comes from not writing decent regression tests before coding.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

Well yeah but there is no good match for that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br><br/><br/>if ($trailer =~<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/(babe|tight|outfit)/) {<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... }
<br> <br>
will also match movies with babes and guys in that kind of outfits. I don't use RE's when I walk down the street<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:p

<h2>What is spine?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sky/">sky</a> on 2003-08-13T12:42:42</h3>
The spine site does not at all say what spine actually is!/

Good question... This is what you get when you release stuff at 4 AM. *SIGH*
I will update the site ASAP. <br> <br>For now, a <b>short</b> description. It's a CMS. Oh yes, uhm it's mod_perl based, uses a DB and should become flexible to expand (at some point). You can browse around the admin section and see what it does (for now).

<h2>&quot;uses a DB&quot;</h2>

Yes, but the DB must conform quite closely to MySQL semantics - AFAICS from the installation page.<br>
Most of the 'id'-fields are auto_increment, which rules out any RDBMS that does not use that syntax (or which doesn't have auto_increment fields).<br>
Your default database setup file uses MySQL syntax to create the database (something for which there is no common syntax yet - Ingres (which I know best) does not allow you to create databases from within a session - a session is connected to a database, it is probably the same for several others.<p>
You need to add something to the TODO-list about not relying on MySQL (or pg) specific thing - look in the DBI book for a survey of differences between the DBMSs.</p><p>
But it looks really nice - and I did want to try it, unfortunately MySQL and compatibles are ruled out by corporate policy - what a shame....</p>

The database integration is something I'd really like to get working properly. I tried to separate all the DB stuff in one package so that can be patched easily. I installed pg so I can iron out some compatibility issues. I welcome any suggestions on this problem<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
