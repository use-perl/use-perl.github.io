<p>When up this morning, I felt kind of funny. I had a dream where I was in the basement for some reason and I walked to the stairs because I heard a sound. I saw my dog running down the stairs and jumping up against me. I even called his name. Suddenly I realized it wasn't my dog but one that resembled it in a strange way. There was a man at the door stating that the dog was perfect for me and that I should keep it but I didn't. I said I lost my dog recently and that I couldn't keep this one. When they walked away, I really felt bad. It got to me. Next time, when I dream something like this, I'm keeping the dog.<br><br>
Every evening, when I come home, I still expect him to be at the front door. I still look through the glass door of the living room, expecting a black blur behind it. I realize I still miss my dog because there is no way I could feel like I do now if I didn't miss him.</p>

<h2>Loosing a dog?</h2>

How does that work? I mean, a dog is not a pair of glasses that you drop somewhere and can't find again later.

Ah, ok. Sorry for the impious tone of my comment.<br> <br>In my childhood I always had a couple of Australian Parrots. They either just died or flew away and I remember quite clearly how crushed I was over the loss each time.

That's ok. I used to have a canary too.. got it for my first birthday. It died when I was about 12. Pets tend to die sooner than men. I just remember all the love I got from it.. and sometimes I dream. All perfectly normal<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
