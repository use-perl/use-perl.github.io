<p>Last day of the IT fair... happy that it's over. I saw loads of cuties again, even scored some email addies from those I talked to. *ROOOOOAAAAAR* Their skirts were not <b>TOO</b> short... just about the right height, not to mention the legs :P Cruising around the hall on a scooter wearing a penguin suit does make some heads turn, and I'm happy to do the sales-pitch to whoever is interested. One of the women at another linux booth was wearing a pretty short skirt, high heels, horns and a devil's tail.. and she looked rather angry when she was giving out business cards with tux on em. Ofcourse she also had the 'evil genius laugh' occasionally. The competition had some really nice women dealing out vouchers for free hotspot access, again *ROOOOAAAAR*. I bumped into loads of friends and acquaintances and I also noticed a pretty old friend who I, for some reason, didn't see in 6 years. She started working for the telecom division at the belgian railways. The loot: some demo CDs, pens, a silly fan, loads of businesscards and half a dozen email addresses from cuties. Gotta love my job. I got some confirmation about a contract. I hope to hear more in the next days. Don't push it... pushing is not good.</p>
