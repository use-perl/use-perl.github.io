<p>I ran into one of my old Uni teachers.. the one that tought Java. At some point during my 5 years in Uni, he asked me (and a handfull of other students one of the english professors recommended), to help him translate one of his <a href="http://fundamentenoop.digibel.be/javahome.htm">Java books</a> to English. I declined. Later on he apparently got students to turn in translated chapters of that book (but with self made up examples to keep it educational), instead of one exam question of their choice. Needles to say, he got quite a bit of complaints from parents and other professors.<br><br>During my time in Uni, we learned about AWT (I remember creating a complete set of GUI components for my first assignment), SWING, JSP, Servlets, Struts, etc. In the end, I'm sticking to my opinion. Java is bloated and slow as hell!<br><br> One of my fellow students was really into the whole .NET thing (hi Gill) ; although he couldn't really counter my remarks (as a .NET novice). Apparently, the year after I graduated, the professor followed the hype and convinced the school board to let him teach .NET instead of Java. Rumour goes that he only did that for one year and that he now is back at the Java game :)</p>
