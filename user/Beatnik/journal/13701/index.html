<p>Well, it's all over and done with. I'm both sad and happy about this. Sad because.. uhm well.. it's over. Happy because it was a great experience. I had a wonderfull time, learned a lot of new things and met a lot of interesting people.<br><br>
Picture update: I have just over 200 pictures.<br><br>On with the talks....<br><br>
acme's talk was actually quite interesting. Now I need some time to look into Parrot (again). I stayed in the O'Reilly room for both Marty's and Dans talks on Perl stealing from Japanese and Parrot. I met some people outside to get lunch at a local junk^H^H^H^Hfastfood restaurant and during lunch I noticed my roommate send me a text message saying I still had to pay the hotel.. <br><br><b>OOPS</b><br><br<After rushing back to the hotel and rushing to the venue, I got in the O'Reilly room just in time to see Elaine start her talk with <i> use CPAN; get laid();</i>... Is that guaranteed?? Because I've been using CPAN.pm for quite some time now :p Sky explained a bit about Ponie next and after that I snuck out to see Greg talk about why he wasn't talking... uhm yes.. well he was talking but just about why he wasn't talking, which he wasn't. Laura conquered my laptop again but I trusted her enough not to stumble unto my pr0.. uhm art collection. Coffee break after that and finally.. finally.. finally the lightning talks. <br><br>I stole my laptop back from Laura and looked for an empty seat near the front. Nick Clark was sitting next to me, with his sombrero. After a few interesting talks and people still needing to plug in their laptop power, it was time for my 5 minutes of fame. Clippy asking to set up external projector made about half the room laugh... After 4 minutes, MJD sounded a bell and I was more or less done. After the lightning talks, there was the famous auction with the infamous Greg McCaroll. Among books, T-Shirts, MJDs Boxers, Elaines Bra, they also auctioned the language of both <a href="http://paris.mongueurs.net">Paris.pm</a> and <a href="http://london.pm.org">London.pm</a>. They'll be in Esperanto for the next year. London.pm tried to keep it in english but &euro;1371 says otherwise.<br><br>
After the auction was over, we were forced out of the building and I headed over to the hotel, 
picked up my suitcase and took the subway to Gare du Nord. I spent the full hour and a half on the train watching 'The Meaning of Life' on my laptop (fast forwarding the scenes you don't really want to show in public).<br><br>
I'd like to thank Paris.pm for making this conference a succes. I had a wonderfull time and hope everyone else had too.<br><br>Note to Laura..  . I looked it up: <br>Main Entry:	<b>yearn</b> <br>
