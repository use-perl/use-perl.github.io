<p>Today was a blast. I wore a penguin suit all day (will put pics online ASAP). I got loads of contacts and apparently people didn't care I was wearing the suit, as long as the stuff I was saying made sense. For some odd reason, the suit gave me superhuman strength and I talked with loads of women (I got pics of me posing with some pretty ones too). I think a picture of me and some Adobe guy is now circulating at Adobe BENELUX. <br><br>I got quite a few fair goodies. Some large, <i>yellow</i> virus/security appliances vendor had a caricaturist so he drew me in the suit :) They also had someone blowing balloon animals (I got a balloon heart) and a drinking glass with logo. Besides that, I got loads of pens and candy (those candy hearts with stuff on it like <i>Pretty</i>, <i>Call Me</i>, <i>Fax Me</i>, <i>Happyness</i>, etc.), some mugs, a key leesh, some stress balls. <br><br>
Fairs are fun..<br><br>
Fairs are even more fun if you're running around in a penguin outfit and don't really care what people think about you.</p>
