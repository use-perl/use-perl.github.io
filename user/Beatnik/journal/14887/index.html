<p>Or.. as my pimp used to say "Seize the day"... Well that's ONE of the things he always says. He's also constantly talking about midgets, beating people with a big stick, my poor man-ho skills and his fruitless attempts to prospect new clients.<br><br>
Anyway, the reference comes from <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0097165/">Dead Poets Society</a>. In this film, Robin Williams plays the part of an english professor at a prep school. He has a rather unorthodox method of teaching (for instance, he makes the pupils rip out the entire introduction section of their textbook on poetry). Unlike most of the other professors he encourages free thinking and at some point a small group of students start a group called the Dead Poets Society (which Keating - Williams founded when he went to the same school as a student). The group meets in an indian cave and reads the work of older (dead) poets out loud.
One of the better quotes from the movie is <br><br><i>
'T is only in their dreams that men truly be free,<br> 'T was always thus, and always thus will be.</i><br><br>A few weeks ago, Ann saw the movie and mentioned it during one of our weekly phone calls. For some odd reason, I still remembered the storyline quite well. It made quite an impression on me when I saw it years ago. At the moment I'm both tired and ill but it still made me all weird inside. It made me wish I went to prep school or even attended more english classes (although I'm quite sure they never covered any poetry there).<br><br>
And now, a message from our sponso.. uhm Pimp. <br><br><i>I've got a website and I want you on the front page. It's called <a href="http://www.lickmynoodle.com/hendrik.jpg">www dot lickmynoodle dot com</a>.</i></p>

<h2>It was not Robin Williams....</h2>

<p>I've heard far too many kids attribute this and other quotes to actors when they should have had this in their core curriculum. It's a quote from Horace:</p>

<p> <b>
Carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero.<br>
 Seize the day, counting as little as possible on tomorrow.
</b> </p>

<p>Carpe diem, learn latin!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I never claimed Carpe Diem was a Williams quote. It's just mentioned quite a lot in the movie. I do have enough cultural background not to randomly attribute quotes to tinseltown people.

The wording was misleading then, but I have heard it said a few times that the quote came from the movie. Schools don't often teach Latin and logic and the classics anymore so it happens.
