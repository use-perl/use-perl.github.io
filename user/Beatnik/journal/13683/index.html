<p>After my short breakfast (2 croissants and a can of orange juice), we headed to the venue...<br>Szabo's talk looked rather nice to start the day with. I didn't really learn anything new but it wasn't all that dull. After that, I decided to hang around in the lobby to work on my slides and code a bit more. I did however saw the talk about TIMTOWTDI, which was actually pretty good. Uri's talk in the ActiveState room was also really good. After that, I ran back to the O'Reilly room for the Fairy Tales talk. <br><br>After a lunch at a local fastfood restaurant, I decided to do the mod_perl statistics talk where some lady with a very italian accent explained a CMS. Mark Fowler had a rather Buffy filled talk about Test modules. I skipped another talk for a few moments in the lobby. I ended up in the ActiveState room for a larger part of the afternoon and a smaller part in the lobby doing some more preparation and talking to the ever-cute Laura :p I stalked Tim Bunce to get the leopard signed, like I did earlier with Jarkko. <br><br>The PerlMonks foto shoot was up next and I promised to put the pic online fast. There was ofcourse also the PerlMonks BOF with about 15 monks, including MJD. We found an indian restaurant after the first (and second) round of beers and we has to pass thru the red light district to find the next pub.</p>
