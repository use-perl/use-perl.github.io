<p>I work in a specialized environment. The 'company' pays a decent chunk of money to get experts in their respective field. Pretty much every one has a masters degree in something, together with a whole bunch of certifications. The other day, I provided one of my co-workers (masters in CompSci, X years of IT experience, CCIE certified,...) with a perl one-liner he could use to change some IP addresses in router config dumps. A few minutes after that, I saw him copy the configs from the router terminal to MS Word, and saving it as a MS Word file.. I asked him if he magically had come across a perl module that parsed MS Word files.. He gave me this very confused look. I explained to him that the one-liner only worked on text files,  as MS Word probably didn't allow changing text strings in THAT way. I even tried explaining some of the checksum and end-of-line issues that might occur. He still gave me this confused look and insisted that we'd try it anyway. We did. FAIL!<br><br>Sometimes work is fun!</p>
