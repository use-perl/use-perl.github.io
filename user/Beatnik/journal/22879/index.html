<p>I just got a call from a recruitement office responding to the job I applied for. We had a nice conversation.. but I feel a bit strange afterwards. Is it common practice to discuss current wages on the phone during a first conversation? I remained vague enough about it. Is it common practice to discuss the reason why you're looking for a new job.. and how do you tell people you got fired, even if it's for economical reason? The good news.. it's looking good (but I'll keep you posted and will continue to look). The bad news? I'll probably have to drive to Brussels every day.. and will have to gain some french quick! :)</p>

<i>Is it common practice to discuss current wages on the phone during a first conversation?</i>

<p>If your current wage is too high, there's no point in proceeding with the negotiations. OTOH, Knowing that you have a low wage might convince them that it would be easier to hire you than somebody else... and they would probably make you a small offer...

</p><p> <i>Is it common practice to discuss the reason why you're looking for a new job</i>

</p><p>What if you punched your previous boss on the face?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p><p>Actually, it's not that common, on first conversations, but it's not that rare either.</p>

Not sure if this will come back to haunt me but I might have stayed vague on that too. I was actually planning on leaving the company but they beat me too it. At the moment, they just can't afford to keep me.. (and that's not personal) and that's not because I make tons of money.

<h3><a href="/user/tinman/">tinman</a> on 2005-01-25T18:09:53</h3>
<p>I've been asked questions like <i>around how much</i> and asked to give a range for salary, with the understanding that it's not a concrete negotiation.
</p><p>In the course of the interview, I've also been asked why I didn't stay at the earlier job as well. I should imagine that saying the company downsized you is acceptable ? Isn't it ? Especially if you have a recommendation from them.</p>

<p>Mmm, so can we expect you at the French Perl Workshop in June 2005 (in Marseille)?</p>

Not sure yet but the people in Avoriaz will only hear me speak french.
