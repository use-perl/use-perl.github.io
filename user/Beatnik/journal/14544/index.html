<p>OK, let's see.. what happened between wednesday and saturday afternoon?<br><br>
Thursday.. uhm nothing special. I went for a (quick) drink with some friends and watched the documentary on TV they shot monday at the office. Besides the boss' 5 minutes of fame, there were also shots of default X screensaves (like DecayScreen or XMatrix or Worms). At some point you can even see Evolution filled with (my) mail and DecayScreen doing stuff to the screen. I recorded it on plain VHS and planned on capturing it digitally during the weekend.. but I forgot the video card at work :(<br><br>On friday, we had an intern coming over. He'll be around every week on friday and bi-weekly on thursday and friday. There also was the Mad Tux wallpaper (which, I'm sure, will be spreading all over the internet in no time). A graphics-designer we know did this great wallpaper and we'll be giving posters of it away to customers and using the digital version as wallpaper on servers we deploy. On friday evening a friend was having his birthday party and he treated us to a movie and some beer uhm drinks. We went to see <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0325980/">Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</a>. It was entertaining but not extremly exciting. There is a lot of eye candy in it (well, you must confess <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0461136/">Keira Knightley</a> is quite cute), a lot of CGI and some nice boats. Depp is a bit weird with his feminin walk, eye-shadow, dreadlocks and gold teeth. In average, I give it a 6.5. 
<br><br>And now for something completly different: I bought the DVD of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0097891/">Wilt</a>, based on the novel with the same name by <a href="http://www.geocities.com/willemfh/sharpe.htm">Tom Sharpe</a>. As always, the book is better.</p>

<h2>depp made that movie</h2>

<p>without him it would have been an awful lifeless movie even with a brown-haired Legolas.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Compared to corset wearing women, too, he looked pretty masculine and sexy.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
