<p>I don't have the habbit to blog about work. It's generally not encouraged (I'm even sure it's mentioned somewhere in the security briefing). This event is quite special. One of my co-workers is leaving us. For arguments sake, let's call him Boris. Boris is polish. I've wanted to blog about him tons of times. Boris is a general pain in the ass. Again, I won't go into detail on this one. To make a long story short, Boris is leaving. He decided that the work he was doing, was not good enough for him. We got his official going-away lunch today (although he's leaving next week). We got him a nice plaque, certificate and also a watch. Both the plaque and the certificate had some official mumbo jumbo on it about how much he contributed to the project, how his work was really valuable etc. *sigh* Technically, he had all the skills that were needed for this project... but he had no people skills. I hate to see him go but I know that, at the same time, he will be replaced by someone with equal technical skills. We'll see how it turns out.</p>
