<p>Besides all the excitement in school this week *cough*, nothing fancy happened so I decided to tinker with my firewall again. I needed VPN and for some obscure reason Smoothwall GPL didn't do it (altho it's a small setting in the Kernel). The last VPN testing I did, were succesfull in test setup but failed on-site. Reason was that somehow routing was known on both boxen and GRE wasn't being forwarded properly. I grabbed an IPCop ISO (basically the Smoothwall GPL with a twist) and grabbed 2 unused boxen to test GRE forwarding. Unable to get onsite last night, due to some wine, we rescheduled to today. Needless to say we didnt make it today either but I already migrated and patched my firewall within 10 minutes of bringing it off-line. My Smoothwall GUI rewrite will still go on, with intent to stuff it into the IPCop tree somehow. To make it official: YES, I am ditching Smoothwall GPL.<br><br>
For those <b>only</b> reading this because of that girl... well, que sera, sera. I'm not going to rush anything. I have <b>no</b> idea where I am at this point (although we still talk and have laughs). We'll see next week thursday (when I'm getting my second backrub) and friday (when we'll both be at a birthday party).<br><br>As a sidenote, I learnt she doesn't speak Sanskriet, Egyptian, pig-latin, Danish, Arabic or Armenian... What is it these days with archeologists?<br><br>I called my ex on monday, having quite a long conversation about life and all. She had a big test on tuesday and she could use some distraction for a second. Fingers crossed! <br><br>One of my best friends left to the United Arab Emirates on tuesday for a 2 week stay. I hope no trigger-happy presidents of some certain western countries decide to start a fight in that area. For those who dont know where the United Arab Emirates is, it's on the north-eastern side of Africa, somewhat below Egypt.<br><br>The last 3 hours of school today were spent in a seminaire given by a local ICT company specialized in security. The topic being obviously Network Security. The guy explained stuff like SSL, Tunnels and VPN. It was kinda interesting but didnt learn something new.<br><br>I'll be stuck updating some Java code the next few days to make up for the not updating some Java code the past few weeks. *sigh* Life of a geek...</p>
