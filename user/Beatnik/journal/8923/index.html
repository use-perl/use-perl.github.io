<p>In this episode of Goldy Locks, our heroine is still in search for her knight in shining armour and the bold uhm bald magician finds himself trapped in a place people in the local burrow call <b><i>*scary music now*</i> The Friend Zone</b>. He uses many ancient and difficult spells to beat the trolls in this scary place. Whatever will happen next? See it tomorrow... Same time, same channel!<br><br>
I hate early mornings and today, I have no intention of changing my mind on that. I was up late last night fixing some b0rken JSP code and I went to bed WAY too late :(<br><br>To summarize our little Soap Episode: I'm stuck in the Friend-Zone (trying NOT to think of it as <a href="http://sinfest.net/d/20021007.html">the worst level in Hell</a>). Should I be <a href="http://sinfest.net/d/20021012.html">glad</a>, or even <a href="http://sinfest.net/d/20021013.html">optimistic</a>?<br><br>
<b>Update (10:09 PM)</b>: Today has been a challenge. Somehow I got out of bed, got on the bus and got into school on time to sleep the first half of the first class. After some cola injections, I felt better and around lunch I managed somehow to be SUPERACTIVE and FUNNY (how did I do THAT??). It lasted for aboot an hour and then I was back to square 1. I'll try not to fall back to caffeine this evening so if I'll live without, you'll notice.<br><br>One of my friends was really sad she never got mentioned in here so : <b>Hi Lara!</b>.<br><br>Since this journal has 1 new readers, guess I'll have to censure this stuff a bit???? NAAaaaaah! This is my mind and it's free for the picking by anyone with a nice smile!</p>
