<p>I have quite a large number of orange T-shirts. All of them are actually from some YAPC (even one I didn't even attend). People have been noticing that I wear them. People have been warning me.. I might actually turn into a dutchmen any time soon now. I have some orange boxers as well.. needless to say, people <b>haven't</b> been making comments about those.. yet!<br><br>A few days after the warnings, one of my co-workers was showing me a TODO list. One of the items on there involved "Leon", or rather, it involved Lyon. After making sure that he actually meant Lyon instead of Leon, my co-workers said something in the line of "Ofcourse I meant Lyon. I don't know anyone called Leon and even if I did, he would be of no help in this item". Somehow orange came to mind again. Purely by chance, I was wearing an orange T-shirt that day. Last year, during the auction, I got a T-shirt from YAPC::Eu in Braga. On the drive home, I saw a portuguese truck. It came from Braga. Someone is trying to tell me something.</p>
