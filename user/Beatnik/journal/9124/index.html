<p>Well, I got trapped into filling in a questionaire send to me by that certain girl. It asked some very personal questions and I'm not sure if I did the right thing answering truthfully to all questions. The questionaire (or that girl, since she send me the list) wanted to know all about how my feelings and memories are towards her. Now, I'm pretty sure she knows I have SOME feelings for her but having to answer YES or NO to certain questions really pushed a man into a corner. I believe in honesty and she did say she wanted some honest answers. Maybe I'm afraid for what she might do (I dont expect her to cut of some vital parts) but I like to keep her as a friend. Will that chance? Time will tell... I'll somehow know eventually how she reacted. I just hope it's not too late by then.<br><br>Bit of IT news: I have been cleaning up Image::Filter to use gd2, fixed the Floyd-Steinberg Dither filter I had lying around for some time and started working on a X degree rotation (which will not be included in Image::Filter 0.05 on your local CPAN mirror now).<br><br>
<b>Note for Els:</b> I hope this won't ruin what we have.</p>
