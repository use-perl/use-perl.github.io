<p>Gotta love cooking... and this time the Pesto was superb. I cook without a scale or a spoon (There is no spoon!). I just guess :)<br><br>
<li>a handfull of fresh basil leaves</li>
<li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
<li>100 grams of parmesan cheese</li>
<li>8-10 olives, without pits</li>
<li>4 pieces of sun-dried tomatoes</li>
<li>50 grams of pine nuts</li>
<li>loads of olive oil... add to own taste</li>
<br><br>Stuff that all in a blender and go crazy. I found that this is enough pesto to mix with some pasta and serve it to 3 people (well, 3 people in our family anyway).<br><br>
I met Ann this afternoon. She looked happy and purty, as usual. Altho we only talked for an hour, it was worth sitting on the train for. I got her her birthday present, a birthday card and a fortune cookie fortune I got when I was at a chinese place in Burlington, ON, Canada during the summer. <br><br>
The seminar was semi-interesting. The guy who ran the belgian DNS service for the better part of the 90's was there to tell us all about the break-in they had at some point. Some other guy from a <a href="http://www.ubizen.com/">local security company</a> talked about general IT security stuff... I didn't learn anything new tho.<br><br>
Annika has feeling a bit down lately. I wish there was something I could do. I always feel a bit uncomfortable whenever someone I really care about is feeling down and sad. <br><br>I know you're reading this... You can call me anytime, about anything. Please don't forget that.</p>
