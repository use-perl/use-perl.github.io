<p>I ran into the bathroom door today (it was dark) and it left a 3 millimeter deep, 7 centimeter high gap on my forehead. I was hoping it was just bump but it was bleeding.. and it kept bleeding. I cleaned the wound and noticed the cut. It seemed best to head to the emergencies and get it fixed up. I now have 3 stitches and I look like I was in a barfight. Damn.</p>

<h2>Oldest excuse</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/BooK/">BooK</a> on 2004-11-22T08:42:08</h3>
<p>You <i>do</i> know that running into the bathroom door is actually the oldest (and probably poorest) excuse one can have for the stigmata of a fight?</p>

Do I really look like the fighting type?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>Actually, with your stitches, you probably <i>do</i> look like the fighting type... The type that loses the fights and tries to hide it with lame excuses like "No, I wan't in a fight, I ran into the door. And then I was so dizzy, that I fell into the stairs. And bumped my head on the ramp. Twice.".</p>
<p>You won't fool us.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>;-)</tt> </p>

<h2>That reminds me...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cog/">cog</a> on 2004-11-22T11:02:38</h3>
Of several things... (each of them reminds of the next one)<br> <br>Once when I was a kid, after switching bedrooms in the house, I got up in the middle of the night and rushed to the bedroom's door to go to the bathroom (in the dark, of course). At least I rushed to the place where the door used to be in the other bedroom... there was a wall there instead...<br> <br>And once, when I was studying in Braga, I got up suddenly and turned to my right side... in Viana, my hometown, I can leave my bed through any side; in Braga, I couldn't leave through the right side... there was a wall there instead...<br> <br>And once (I don't remember this one, but my grandmother usually tells me this), when I was really young, I got up in the bed at my granmother's house and thought I saw her behind the curtains, waiting for me to jump to her, as I usually did... so I jumped... she wasn't there... there was a wall there instead...<br> <br>And many, many others...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>Maybe that's why I turned out like this<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>My best head bashing trick</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/kjones4/">kjones4</a> on 2004-11-23T00:34:03</h3>
When I was 12, I decided to leap down to the bottom of some stairs at my grandmotherss house. I didn't notice that there was a beam part way down that effectively knocked me on the forehead and flat onto my back. Luckily it was a fairly minor gash.
