<p>I just got back from <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0273517">Darkness</a>.  I don't really understand why it's rated R. There is no nudity, a minimum of foul language, nothing is really <b>too</b> scary. In general, if you liked the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0298130">Ring</a>, you will probably like this movie a bit. It's not entirely creepy but it's kinda ok. Ofcourse I was distracted by the couple sitting 2 seats next to me.<br><br>
The story: A family moves to Spain to live in a house after a certain event took place 40 years ago. The son shows some similarities with the boy in The Ring; he claims his bed is eating his pencils, he draws rather funny pictures and is talks about strange things all the time. The daughter suspects something is going on, the father has occasional panic and anger attacks and the mother is quite uhm passive. <br><br>
The ruling: What the film tries to accomplish is that the viewer is afraid to turn off the light at night. It didn't work for me (yet).. It has an open ending so there might just be a sequel... You never know with those tinseltown folks.<br><br>
While I was queueing for my ticket, I noticed that there is YAS (Yet Another Sequel) to Scary Movie... *sigh*<br><br>
Annika is going on an archeological field trip (no pun intended) for 2 weeks. I'm sure she'll have loads of fun. This is really what she lives for.</p>
