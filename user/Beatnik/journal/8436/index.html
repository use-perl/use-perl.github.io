<p>Well, the week is over...<BR>
Schoolweek anyway :) Saturday, I spent the day in Gent with some friends. Talking a bit, getting beaten in lasergaming by 7 8-year olds :(. Ann really wanted to come over too but she somehow didnt manage. There was a nice party in the evening and seeing that purdy girl again with nice curls *cough*, really made a difference :) I met up with Ann on monday eventually, to have a quick chat and stuff. She looked good, as usual. I can generally say I had a very unproductive week, starting on tuesday. French class was semi boring and I didnt do much during project hour either. Yesterday was kinda ok but I worked more on my Java project than anything else. I managed to fix some JSP/JNLP issues for java class and did a magic swap on a sucky homework using a not so sucky homework. I managed to get an A on it too :)<BR>C++ class was kinda interesting and altho STL really is something I have to look into, I did that Java project again :) My project partner magically disappeared that afternoon but I didnt really bother. I overslept today, missing 2 classes but I did go to the seminare this afternoon. Some local ICT company send someone explaining network visions. During that class, I had another emotional moment, people on my MSN list can confirm it :) Tomorrow, being friday and all, is a day off school (maybe I should think about studying). I kept a timeslot open in my OH SO busy day to install my new firewall (See few entries back).<BR><BR>Let the record state that today is one of those days where <BR><BR><FONT SIZE="5"><B>I CAN REALLY USE A HUG</B></FONT>.
