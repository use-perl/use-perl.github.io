<p>The following happened to me this morning when I walked over to the bank at work (yes, AT work) and asked to open a savings account:
<pre>Me: Hi, I'd like to open a savings account.
Bank teller: Do you have already an account here?
Me: No. Is that a problem?
Bank teller: No. Please wait a second</pre>
At this time, the lady behind the counter walks over to the assistent manager, talks to him for a moment and then walks over to the manager. I overhear some of it and there seemed to be some confusion.. The manager walks over to the counter..<pre>Manager: You want to open a savings account?
Me: Yes, is that a problem?
Manager: Do you already have a bank account here?
Me: No.
Manager: Where do you have your bank account?
Me: At bank FOO
Manager: You do realize that you can only withdraw money from it when you come to the bank, right?
Me: Yes, but I can still *deposit* money on it by bank transer? I mean, it is a savings account..
Manager: Yes... but why do you want a savings account here?
Me: Because I'm too lazy to find the time to go to another bank and I work here so it's easier.
Manager: OK (still looking a bit confused)</pre>It seemed like they almost didn't want to take my money.. Anyway, I got an appointment to set up the savings account. I have no idea why I need an appointment for that but that's what I have.</p>

When I was a teller I could open a savings account in about 15 minutes start to finish. Pheh, an appointment.

When I was in America a couple of years ago on a holiday it took me at lot more than 15 minutes to get added to my girlfriends bank account. A couple of years afterwards the account was frozen because they thought I was Iranian.

in the netherlands it is much easier to buy a house or car than to open any sort of a bank account. especially if you don't have a current employer - forget about it. i finally ended up with an account attached to my (now) wife's and that took an appointment, i don't know how many different forms, signatures, promises of allegianceship, etc. we were in there must have been an hour!
