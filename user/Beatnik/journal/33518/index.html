<p>Yesterday morning, around 4.43 AM, my sister gave birth to a healthy baby girl. Floor (a bit like the dutch version of Florence) was 53 centimeters tall and weighed 3.180 kilograms. It's amazing how something so small can steal your heart so quickly. At work, I got some international newspapers (USA Today, The Times, De Telegraaf and De Standaard) so later on, she can look up what happened in the world on her birth day. I also asked my italian co-worker to call home and have someone send a postcard with yesterdays date on it. I wrote one myself and got an american date stamp on it. <br><br>The 13th of each month is a special day for my sister and brother-in-law because that's the day of the month it all started for them.. They met on the 13th, they got married on the 13th and now had their baby on the 13th. Coincidentially, I also met my girlfriend on the 13th. <br><br><b>Edit:</b> <a href="http://www.floortjestynen.be/">Pictures online</a></p>

Yeay.<br><br>I went out and bought 2 newspapers (I couldn't decide which to get) the day our baby Sky was born - they're stashed in her nursery.<br><br>Postcards are a cool idea too.
