<p>I spend most of friday evening talking and watching a movie. I went home around midnight but continued the talk online. I went bed til around 1.30 AM and slept rather late. For some reason, I had a 2 hour phone call with one of my best friends and rushed out of the house around 20 to 7 to work a bit at a local (but rather large) party. There were quite a few of local popstars and a few international ones. I spent most of the time selling tickets so I didn't really see a thing. We did get free drinks (as in free software), a shirt and a nice paycheck. Loads of purty women went inside.. and some men too (altho I didn't pay all that much attention to them). Afterwards, we cleaned out the VIP lounge and the foyer, dragged a huge plastic bag across the main party hall and helped a bit at the bar. BTW: Those small bottles of champagne are <b>Yummi</b>.<br><br>And now for something completly different...<br><br>
<i>
How to seduce a woman?

<br>
How to seduce men?

<br></i>
Why didn't I have this list sooner?? :P <br<br>Well, OK.   I confess... That list works on regular women :) but she's special :|<br><br>

The lyrics come from an <em>old</em> '60'ies popgroup "The Monkees", who had a large number of hits. I'm a believer was one of their bigger - <a href="http://flexquarters.com/monkmp3/Monkees_-_I'm_A_Believer_(sample).mp3" title="flexquarters.com">a sample can be heard here</a flexquarters.com> (I found it on <a href="http://www.monkees.net/" title="monkees.net">The Monkees</a monkees.net>.<br>
They had a highly rated TV-show, where they fooled around, sang songs, and generally made fools of themselves - all very 60-ish.<br>
It does sometimes feel as if I am ancient when my old favourites reappear for the second or third time and nobody can remember who originally presented them - just the other day I heard 'Whiskey in the Jar' attributed to Phil Lynnot!</p><p>
Pheew - I feel old! Must stop reminicing and return to coding - now where did I put that FORTRAN IV manual?</p>

Indeed. The song was actually written by Neil Diamond, who was a popular crooner in the 70's. See <a href="http://www.vex.net/user/paulmac/diamond/top30.html" title="vex.net">here</a vex.net>, for a list of his most famous hits.

I don't need to try to find a sample online, I have the CD and it is in my MP3 library.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
