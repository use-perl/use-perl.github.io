<p>I'm almost packed. I still need some things like my tooth brush and shower gel but I'll pack those last.  Tomorrow morning, I'm going to pick up my board at the shop and go do my exams in the afternoon. We leave for <a href="http://www.avoriaz.com/">Avoriaz, France</a> around midnight. It'll be a long drive.<br/><br/><br><br>
As a sidenote, I wish Ann all the best on her exams tomorrow. I know she studied hard for it... which is more than I can say for myself. Wish I could be here on Valentine's day. I'll send her a text message instead. I had a phone call with her today, since I assumed her exams were all over. I was planning my summer vacation and was checking if I was going to be near her then. She didn't have a chance to look at the brochure yet so I guess we'll have a talk after I get back, in a week or so. I heard those clicks again (twice this time). Now, I'm sure they weren't from someone listening in on us since I was talking to her on the cellphone.<br><br>
I got a package from <a href="http://www.cafeshops.com/cp/store.aspx?s=perlmonks">Cafepress </a> today. I ordered 2 shirts back in December so   today (<i>2 to 4 weeks later</i>), I got my <a href="http://www.cafeshops.com/cp/prod.aspx?p=perlmonks.4100611">Expect the Inquisitors-Baseball Jersey</a> and my <a href="http://www.cafeshops.com/cp/prod.aspx?p=perlmonks.4099240">PM wants you to use strict t-shirt</a>. They're in my bag so if you spot someone wearing a perl related T-Shirt on the Avoriaz webcam, it might be me... altho it is pretty cold out there :)</p>
