<p>Well, I couldn't resist.. Watched the Matrix again today (there is always a reason to watch the Matrix again ofcourse). The famous black cat scene is today's inspiration. <br><br>
The past few days have been hectic.. But then again, which days aren't? I had to turn in some C++ exercises and finish my resume for seminars tomorrow. Brought laptop to school but apparently my team partner didn't update his code and he couldn't access it until later today, which didn't allow me to get the code done I'd liked to. Anyway, I'll catch up somehow.I did manage to add some code to Apache::CVS::MyHTML, which allows sorting.<br><br>
I met up with an old friend today. We talked for about two hours, had some laughs. I did enjoy seeing her again and have some casual talks.<br><br>It's been 4 months already :( Every day, since 8th september 2002,  I realize I still love Ann. I love her enough not wanting to hurt her feelings by trying to get back together. If it's meant to be, it'll grow.</p>
