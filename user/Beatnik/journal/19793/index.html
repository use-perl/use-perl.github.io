<p>Friday: Went to folk fest with a friend.. Lot's of fun there.<br><br>
Saturday: Saw Fahrenheit 9/11 (for some reason is 9/11 not the temperature paper ignates) with some friends (and some alcohol afterwards)<br><br>
Sunday: Slept REALLY late, cleaned the house and ate chocolade cake of forementioned friend.<br><br>
Factoid of the day: apparently 1% of <i>all women</i> masturbates daily while 49% of <i>all women</i> have never masturbated. I got these figures from a local TV show so I pressume this doesn't count for other countries.<br><br>
Note to myself: Finish papers for Belfast</p>

1%? If that were true anywhere in the world, you'd think that the dildo purveyors would have gone out of business. Maybe I should pitch a book fashioned after the kids book 'everybody poops' and call it 'everybody jerks it'. Don't believe anything you see on the TV these days......

Would you care to give us a more realistic guess? Most women I know (and with whom I can talk about this openly) don't do it daily<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Well, you know, I don't talk about jerking off with my male friends much less my female friends...I can live without asking such pressing questions such as frequency of masturbation, but anyone who believes that 49% of women don't ever masturbate probably also believe women are servile and only put on this earth to serve men. Here's one site that suggests <a href="http://www.the-clitoris.com/f_html/m_stats.htm" title="the-clitoris.com">6% almost 30 years ago</a the-clitoris.com> which would likely mean even more these days. Even the Kinsey report was far higher than that. Even without the threat of hairy palms that the catholic church used to try to frighten the boys with, there still seems to be a stigma for girls who admit to such activities. It's a particular subject where you're likely to get a much lower statistic than what is real.

I dont actually <b>believe</b> that number of 1% ; just that one 1% actually admits of doing it. It's still a taboo (especially among women). For some reason I find it easier to discuss with female friends than with male friends<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) One guest on the show (and I'm not saying I agree but merely mention it to add another view) claimed that he found that the women he knew who did, were better in bed. In some way I can understand this claim since it's <i>muy importante</i> to understand your own body! (Is it obvious I've been reading a lot of those sexual awareness books lately??). I've learned a lot about the female attitude on this topic after reading my first Nancy Friday book.

If that were true, how come guys aren't all magnificent in bed? Huh?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I also think Nancy Friday is mostly bollocks.

I never claimed all MEN were excellent in bed because they masturbated.. I stated that the guest claimed most women he knew were better<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I will skip the analogies about riding a bike or a car and having sex (because I wouldn't want to get you psyched up<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) )

So? I remember some statistic in the same program about men in a serious relationship (which I presume marriage is) and masturbation... but I always seem to forget those numbers (especially after eating tons of chocolat cake!)

Well, while I was on my honeymoon of sorts, I remember a newsbite mentioning that 50%+ or so of men jerk it on their honeymoon whereupon I looked across the bed and got a goofy smile. I really should write that book with cute kiddie pics...'everybody jerks it, baby, yeah!'

yes I know.. I saw the film in the mid 80's when it was on TV. Since I mentioned 9/11 was NOT the temperature, I already knew where the title of the book came from<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

No, that's not what you mentioned.  You mentioned:<br>
<br> <b>
(for some reason is 9/11 not the temperature paper ignates)</b> <br> <br><br/><br/>which I took to be a question.<br> <br>  Translation problem, rather?  Sorry for the misunderstanding.
