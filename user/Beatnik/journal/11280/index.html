<p>While I was out on lunch yesterday, someone tried to call me on my cellphone... They called me back around 8.30PM and for some reason the conversation lasted over an hour 
(which actually didn't happen before... if you don't count panic calls from some bitchy ex girlsfriend.. but that's over a year ago).
<br><br>
Apparently someone noticed my '<i>social and moderation skills</i>' because some huge corporation from Redmond, WA is headhunting my ass. I have a meeting on tuesday at the local office in Diegem with some lady called Avril Primo (she's definitly french...).

Why does speed delivery mean you have to get yourself out of bed at 6.30 to sign off for the package?? I think I'll have some reading material by Tuesday. <b>*ARGH*</b> I still need to get a suit :(<br><br>
If this thing goes thru, which appears it will, I'll be starting corporate training courses the day I graduate.. There goes my vacation. I'll still have to decide weither or not I'd want to move over there :( With this on my mind, I don't think I'll get much sleep over the weekend.<br/><br/>Guess I'll better get a new passport and head over to the embassy to get some paperwork done...<br><br><b><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Beatnik/journal/11361">Follow-up</a></b></p>

<p>The Borg are trying to assimilate you? Why resist - they are sincere in their beliefs when they say that they're only seeking to improve the quality of life.</p>
