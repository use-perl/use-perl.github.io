<div class="span8">
<p>In Paris, public transport is everywhere.. There are busses, subway, trains. <a href="http://www.ratp.info/picts/plans/gif/reseaux/metro.gif">Subway goes up until zone 2 (about 20 minutes from center to terminus)</a>. Busses go much farther.. Trains (RER) go as far as most busses. Yesterday, one of my co-workers was in Massy. We decided to meet up so I left Boulogne around 7 PM and took a few busses between 7 and 9 PM. When I arrived at Massy RER station (which is still 1 bus ride away from my final destination), I wasn't all that sure there were still busses going. I ended up taking the RER in Massy and not meet up with my co-worker. If I would've met up, I probably wouldn't have been able to take a bus back to Chaville. Once in Paris Nord, I took the subway to Abesse and had an excellent Spring salad (with rocket salad, avocado and asparagus) at <a href="http://www.frommers.com/destinations/paris/D54508.html">the deux moulins cafÃÂ©</a>. As before, there were tons of people just visiting for the "AmÃÂ©lie" factor. Although I had very little time, I did have a mascarpone desert with raspberries. There are still busses after midnight between Pont de Sevres and Chaville/Atrium.<br><br>This morning, traffic was terrible. On the bus from Atrium to Pont de Sevres, some <b>cute</b> woman was rubbing up against me... (Hope to see you again, same bat-time, same bat-bus??) and I had to wait for about 25 minutes to get a connection. When it finally came, it took an entirely different route but I ended up where I had to be anyway.. 20 minutes late.<br><br>Tori Amos is excellent bus music.<br><br>The upside of public transport in Paris.. There are beautifull women everywhere.</p>
