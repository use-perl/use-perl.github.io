All is fair and beautiful<br>
TonightÃ¢â¬â¢s as good as any other night<br>
Confusing me as usual<br>
I think I'll need a map to get it right<br>
I set up for the smallest clue<br>
Anything to get it right on you<br>
I confess...<br>
<br>
That I feel like I still need to learn <br>
the very first thing about you<br>
And I feel like I could crash and burn<br>
Whenever I get around you<br>
<br>
So alive and colorful<br>
I never seen an aura quite as bright <br>
The image is indelible<br>
The first thing and the last thing on my mind<br>
When I think IÃ¢â¬â¢m closing in<br>
ItÃ¢â¬â¢s obvious that I donÃ¢â¬â¢t know just where to begin<br>
<br>
Ã¢â¬ËCause I feel like I still need to learn <br>
the very first thing about you<br>
And I feel like I could crash and burn<br>
Whenever I get around you<br>
Yes, I feel like I still need to learn <br>
the very first thing about you<br>
And I feel like I could crash and burn<br>
Whenever I get around you<br>
<br>
IÃ¢â¬â¢ll be your crook<br>
Sing a different hook <br>
And a trick in the book till you buy it.<br>
IÃ¢â¬â¢ll take up the slike<br>
I would cover your tracks<br>
Make a front to attack<br>
Start a riot...<br>
<br>
I Feel like I still need to learn <br>
the very first thing about you<br>
I Feel like I could crash and burn<br>
Whenever I get around you<br>
Yes, I feel like I still need to learn <br>
the very first thing about you<br>
And I feel like I could crash and burn<br>
Whenever I get around you<br>
<br>
Whenever I get around you...<br>
<br>
I feel like I still need to learn <br>
the very first thing about you<br>
I feel like I could crash and burn<br>
Whenever I get around you<br>
I feel like I still need to learn <br>
the very first thing about you<br>
I feel like I could crash and burn...<br>
