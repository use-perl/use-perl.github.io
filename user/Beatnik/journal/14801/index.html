<p>and realize you're 25 years old. The past 9131 days have been uhm great. Most I can't even remember, some I can. If time goes as fast in the next 25 years as it has in the past, I'll be 50 in no time.. (no pun intended). I wish to thank everyone who contributed to my life in some way and only hope I contributed to other people's life as well.
<br><br><i>
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road. <br>
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go.<br>
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why. <br>
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time. <br><br>
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right. <br>
I hope you had the time of your life. <br><br>
So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind. <br>
Hang it on a shelf of good health and good time. <br>
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial. <br>
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while. <br><br>
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right. <br>
I hope you had the time of your life. <br><br>
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right. <br>
I hope you had the time of your life. <br><br>
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right. <br>
I hope you had the time of your life.</i><br>
