<p>At Els' party yesterday, someone got a book called '101 ways to pick up women'. What struck me was that immediatly all women were reading the book and that they started commenting on how things may or may not work. Ofcourse every single one of them will fall for at least one of those things.<br><br>Here's my very short list of things to think about when trying to pick up women:<br>
<li>Don't think! Women can smell men who think a mile away</li>
<li>Don't try hard! Show healthy interest but don't stalk! Some women find it a turn on but <b>MOST</b> do not.</li>
<li>Wipe that <i>I want to get laid tonight</i> look of your face... even if you want to get some. You might attract the wrong women.. Ofcourse if you want to attract that kind of women... ;)</li>
<li>Getting TOO drunk usually is not a good idea. Waking up in someone else's bed in the morning and not knowing how you got there and who that person is right next to you, can be quite scary.</li>
<li>Keep your darker hobbies a secret until the 2nd date. It might be adviced not to mention the goat sacrifices at all. Again, if attracting THAT kind of women is your goal, by all means...</li></p>

Again, if attracting THAT kind of women is your goal, by all means...<br></i></li> </ul>  <br>If you are supposed to keep the goat sacrifices under wraps until at least the 2nd date, when can you mention that you are into Computers and Programming?  After you are married?  Or, is that too soon?<br> <p>OTOH, they can usually tell you are a geek on sight, so perhaps there's no point in trying to hide it...  Maybe you should tell them right away about the Goats to distract them and soften the blow?</p>
