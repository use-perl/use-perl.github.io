<p>I originally bought <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0299658/">Chicago</a> as a present for a friend but somehow it ended up in my collection.. *UGH*<br><br>I only watched about halfway through and I liked it.. in a weird kind of way. The shifting setting is a bit confusing (or maybe it was just because I was watching it at 1 AM). The singing is great, costumes are nice, acting is good.. I'm not sure about the story line. If you're into the whole musical craze, go rent!</p>

I don't quite get it, why people like you buy DVD's of movies they only "kind of" like.<br> <br>Can you explain?<br>

You could also read his previous journal entry:
<blockquote> <div>I bought some DVDs over the weekend. I've seen most of them by now..</div> </blockquote>

Well, yes.. I bought Chicago for a friend.. You still have to buy presents, even if you're giving them away (or so was the plan). I like it enough to buy it for myself (if it didn't end up in my collection already). I can't say I have a lot of DVDs I don't actually like (I'll post a list some day). I'm not sure about my brother's collection though. One of the first DVDs he ever bought was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117705/" title="imdb.com">Space Jam</a imdb.com>.
