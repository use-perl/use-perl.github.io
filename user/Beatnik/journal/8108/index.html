<p>Today was one of those days where you wished you just could stay in bed all day. Not because it was such a shitty day, but because I was just tired and I didnt feel like going to school. I ended up getting up, going to school and screwing up some workstations as well, which is always a plus. In a room full of regular windows users, I saved the day by being able to install a NIC properly on a WinNT. The Networking course continued by attempting to connect a WinNT client stuck in Workgroup to a Win2k PDC stuck in Domain. Free classes so no bad grades for not succeeding.<BR><BR>
By the time I got home, cooked some pasta and had supper, it was 9 PM and I didn't plan on doing anything tonight. Since I was still in a corny mood (and probably will be for quite a while), I watched   YACM (Yet Another Corny Movie). I normally can take quite a low dosage of cornieness but somehow I felt  "You've got mail" kinda charming. Charming but predictable ofcourse. On the upside, Meg surely lightens it all up and somehow Tom Hanks gets stuck in there as well. Ignoring the fact that probably half the film budget came from AOL, I'd say it's a rather normal flick to watch while wasting YANSAH (Yet Another Night Stuck At Home).<BR><BR>On the Perl side of things, I'll be causing loads of people heart attacks when I finally get the site for Leuven.PM out there. I'm trying to do it as clean as I can but no guarantees. To put it mildly, I <B>SUCK</B> at graphics stuff (oh yeah, that's an understatement).</p>
