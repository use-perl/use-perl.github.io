<p>Apparently I'm on a roll here.. I went to a party tonight. I met tons of people from my old high-school.. which was fun. There was also a tall pretty girl with nice curls. We talked and danced a bit and I asked her out (neither of us was drunk or even tipsy). What is a normal (as in not pathetic or desperate-looking) timeframe to contact her?  Should I wait just a little bit (a day or 2) or should I send her an e-mail as soon as I can get my hands on a working ethernet connection?</p>

<p>If you have her phone number, call her.  Don't email her.  And don't call the same day, but definitely call in the next couple of days.  Sound like you're interested, not desperate.</p>

<p>And did I mention the part about not emailing her?  Email is so high school<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

She only gave her email address. I'll ask for her phone number in my email<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Did you get her e-mail address before, or after you asked her out? If it's the latter, that definitely is a good sign.

I asked her out.. then asked for her cell phone or email address. We now have exchanged a few emails and she added me to MSN. Considering this all happened yesterday, it's going quite well. Better not jynx it.

Well, it definitely implies she doesn't mind you asking her out.

As a matter of fact, we already set a date and decided what to do. If nothing happens, you'll read it first here!
