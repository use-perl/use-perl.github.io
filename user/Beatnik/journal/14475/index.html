<p>I visited my old highschool today. I planned a meeting with one of my old teachers about internships at the company I work for. It was strange walking back in there after 5 years. I still remember a lot of the good times I had, the people I met and friends I made. There were about 12 students in the class and I explained a bit what kind of students we were looking for. In the process of introducing the company, I briefly talked about linux and open source. There was no sudden uprising of men in penguin suits or women in skimpy bikinis with Tux tattoos... DAMN. 
While I was talking to the teacher afterwards, I didn't think about how he almost flunked me for the Visual Basic exam (without bragging, I was the best programmer in the class). Until this day, I'm still not sure how I could have 3 small mistakes on my exam and get 53% while friend had the same mistakes and got 93%. I think I shouldn't ask him.. if I want to close a deal.<br><br>I called Ann today, at work (if my boss is reading this, I did it after usual working hours). She has been considering her options in choosing a new course in University.  I'm confident she'll choose whichever suits her best.<br><br>I passed by the old dorm of a friend yesterday. Her name wasn't on the doorbell anymore.<br><br>

Or has time rewritten every line?<br>
If we had the chance to do it all again,<br>
Tell me? would we? could we?</blockquote></p>

<h2>53% vs. 93%</h2>

Depending on how your teacher draws his 5s and 9s, the difference could be sloppy handwriting.

I think it has more to do with the fact that the other kids asked me questions and didn't ask the teacher... but that's just a guess<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
