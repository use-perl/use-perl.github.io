<p>I just packed my suitcase for my third visit to Paris in 3 months. It's a 3 day course so I can't stay for the weekend... unless, I stay the weekend before (which is what I'm doing). I'm taking the 9.40 Thalys and hope to get to my hotel around 11.30. I'm staying in one of those standardized rooms of a default hotel chain. It's just around the corner from Moulin Rouge and Les Deux Moulins. No pictures this time, since my brother needed his camera for a rescue mission in London. Don't ask but I think Billy (yes, THAT Billy, cog!) Corgan is somehow involved. I checked one of the local gymns yesterday. One of my friends is joining me in what I can only call a <i>feeble</i> attempt to get some excercise. <br><br>This week was Annikas last week in Venice. She's returning home on Monday (so I expect a party REALLY soon!). We're talking again (YAY!). I'm also talking again to M. Not sure how she thinks but I'm not worrying about that stuff anymore. She has a boyfriend she can whine to.<br><br>Work has been hectic. There were quite a bit of <i>I need this done today</i> days.<br><br>I met up with some friends tuesday and ate at a vegetarian restaurant. We found a nice pub later on and had some *cough* mojito *cough* drinks. <br><br>My iPod seems to act all funky. I can't seem to sync anything when I'm on a different profile. I've ripped a ton of CDs so I can listen to some decent music for a change :)</p>

<p>The funny thing is, I read "Don't ask but I think Billy" and I said to myself "What Billy? Corgan?"

</p> <p>I guess you read my mind<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
