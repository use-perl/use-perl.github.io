<p><b>Customer:</b> It is not working anymore! <b>*PANIC*</b><br><br>

<i>After 2 days of swearing and cursing and replacing all file I/O routines by alternatives...</i><br><br>
<i>*Uncheck flag that hides file extensions for known file types in explorer*</i><br><br>
<b>Me: </b>It is working...<br><br><br/><br/>What basically happened was that the customer complained that my program was broken because the file was there but it wasnt being read... It seemed it didn't even find it... Eventually the file was called DATA.TXT.TXT only because I didn't realize the extension wasn't being shown... hence the file wasn't being found. After unchecking the flag and renaming it to DATA.TXT, my program was working fine... The problem existed between the chair and the keyboard.<br/><br/></p>

<h2>Been there</h2>

<p>I seethe with rage at my own memory of a similar problem.  I was so hot the last time it happened I was ready to break a window, throw my brand new laptop out it, and leave (obviously quitting my job).  There's nothing so infuriating as a computer that won't follow instructions when the instructions are clear, the data source is there, and everything should work<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... unless you count OS designers who try to "help" you in stupid ways like hiding file extensions.</p>



<h2>Panic</h2>

When in doubt, double your fee.
