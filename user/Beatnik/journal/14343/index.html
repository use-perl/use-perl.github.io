<p><i>Dear Friend, Mom, Dad, Brother, Sister, Daughter, Son...<br><br><br/><br/>I discovered a wonderfull product and I immediatly thought you might like it as well. This is 100% risk free, it's free of charge, costs billions of free dollars and is 100% natural. It works both as a penis enlargment drug, a breast enlargment drug, a printer cartridge, a selection of handpicked stock and a device to detect speed guns used by most north-american cops (and some mounties). Please include your credit card information and shipping and billing address so we can send you our free product without charging to your card. We accept VISA, Mastercard, American Express. You are on this list because you were stupid enough to click on a link or submit a form without blinking an eye. There is no way you'll ever get off this list unless you hunt us down and beat us with a large pointy stick. We have a not satisfied, not money back guarantee but we're positive you'll feel ripped off anyway. Call us on our toll free number 1-800-SPAMMMM now and get a free nose job drug with if you're the very very very first caller...</i><br><br>
I've been looking into the specifics of SPAM mail since I need to create some simple tests to probe a customers mail filter, without upsetting the customer, claiming his penis is WAY too small.</p>
