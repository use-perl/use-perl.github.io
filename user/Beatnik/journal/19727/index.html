<p>What would you do if you (and 10 other people) were locked in a mall (ignore the zombies outside) for the rest of your life?</p>

change the root password and keep it for myself.

What?!? Not go onto the roof and play sniper? Or play golf? or go to starbucks naked? Make a huge stack of pillows and jump on it? Dance around in women's underwear? (uhm scratch that last one) Drink all the import beer? Read ALL the Perl books? Sing the national anthem through the PR system? Spraypaint your favorite slogan (JAPH) onto the marble floors? Fill the fountain with milk and swim in it?<br> <br>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363547/" title="imdb.com">Dawn of the dead...</a imdb.com> It's quite funny actually!

Are you implying that I'm a geek somehow?

You say 'rest of your life' as if that's a well-defined space of time.  Are we talking normal lifespan here?

Well, that depends how long the zombies outside stay outside... Ofcourse, if you have been bitten, you're not going to live long anymore and probably turn into a Zombie too<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>It's kinda strange how you come up with funny questions while watching a <i>horror</i> movie.

See, I was thinking this was a more abstract thing.
<p>
What are my chances of escape?  Any?</p>

Well, there are some mall shuttles in the underground parking lot you can rebuild to armoured vans<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Ofcourse, you can try to escape through the sewage systems. The zombies will eventually get everyone on the planet so running away to a <i>deserted</i> island might also not be a good idea<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Yeah, I might do the mall shuttle upgrade.  The sewer system sounds like instant death unless I'm armed somehow.  If I'm fairly well armed, then it might be a choice.
<p>
If I assume I have no chance of survival, then I guess I'd take the gas and coat the place, then open the doors and let in as many zombies as I could before I torched them.  What the hell -- can't hurt to take a few out, right?
</p><p>
If I assume I have a chance, armor one of the vehicles, take the gas from the others and build a improv flamethrower.  Time to head for an airport.
</p><p>
Hmmm...I wonder what the difference between a business traveler and a zombie is?  Oh, right -- one isn't drunk.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<i>You are in a large Mall. You carry : a sniper riffle, a barbecue set, a perl book, a bag of donuts, half a cup of coffee and some riffle ammo. On the north there are glass doors that lead to the parking lot, which is filled with brain-eating zombies. On the south and east, there are shops. On the west, there is a staircase towards the roof and the underground parking lot. What do you want to do?</i>: North<br> <br>
<i>You are now in the staircase. North are the stairs to the underground parking lot, south are the stairs to the root. To the west is the door to the mall. What do you want to do?</i>: North<br> <br><br/><br/><i>You are now on the roof. Below you see the outside parkinglot, filled with brain-eating zombies. What do you want to do?</i>: Use sniper riffle on brain-eating zombies<br> <br>
<i>You look through the riffle scope to the brain-eating zombies. You see Bill Gates, Guido Van Rossum, Saddam Hoessein and Dr. Ruth. What do you want to do?</i>: Throw barbecue set towards Guido Van Rossum<br> <br>
<i>You hit Guido on the head. He grabs the barbecue set and turns it into a Python script<br> <br> </i> <b>Blurgh</b>  <br> <br>
Is it obvious that in my pre-zombie (read pre-consultant) life, I wasn't a game programmer?<br> <br>The only way you'll rate <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0363547" title="imdb.com">Dawn of the dead</a imdb.com> as <i>Good</i> is if you turn into a zombie yourself prior to viewing that film.
