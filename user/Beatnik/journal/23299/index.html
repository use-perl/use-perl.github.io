<p>I had 2 talks planned for today. The first one was for a techie vacancy at an ISP. I went through an agency so I'm basically past the first selection. The talk went quite well. It ended around noon and about an hour later, I had another talk (one with both someone from HR and some local Java guru). I havent touched a single piece of java in almost 2 years and suddenly I had to explain all kinds of weird things. Yes, I could have prepared properly but there is no way I could recap all the Java I knew before. I think/hope I left the impression that I know my stuff but that it's been a while.<br><br>During my drive from $company[0] to $company[1], the recruiter for $company[0] was on  the phone, asking how it went, if it was what I was looking for, how I would decide which offer to take, etc. My next 2 second interviews are on wednesday. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.</p>
