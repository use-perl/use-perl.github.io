<p>I just had a nice chat with one of the consultants sent to us by the vendor. I've been using one of their less popular products. I logged a ticket to ask about certain things, which later turned out to function properly after all.. The consultant was actually really helpful about all this and welcomed feedback on the whole issue.
A typical helpdesk guy would probably start complaining about lost time.. A typical engineer would be glad someone was using his product and someone actually had comments and suggestions.. <br><br>Joy Joy!</p>

<h2>Are they really that helpful?</h2>

Or is it because he was a consultant?<br><br>Software Engineers come in all types.   Some of the ones at my job think they are WAN/LAN Engineers, Network Designers and System Administrators all rolled into one.  They cause me grief to no end and they take offense that you dared challenge their higher IQ.   For some the title of Engineer is an identifier that they are smarter then you.<br><br>Point is you find nasty software engineers just like I have found helpful helpdesk types.
