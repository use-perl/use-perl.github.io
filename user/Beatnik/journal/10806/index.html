<p>During the past 2 days, I hardly had some time for myself. Yesterday morning, I started working at 7 (which meant I was up at 6). We went off to do some cabling at the <a href="http://www.infosecurity.be/">Info Security</a> fair, where <a href="http://www.ba.be">Better Access</a> has a booth. I spent the better part of the day about 10 meters above the floor, stuffing those cardboard boxes full of Cat5 thru every ceiling beam I could find. We had about 3 boxes, today about half of the cable was used (quick math: approx. 450 meters). <i>f34R MY 37H3Rn3t sK111S f0R 1 4M 13E7</i> <b>*</b>. Around 8.30 PM we headed to another fair where we had to do some more cabling and install a router and wireless base station. We headed home around 9.25. The party I was going to started around 10 so I left my bag in the car and met up with friends. Somehow, I partied til 3 AM (I confess I did have a good time... great company) and had a full 3 hours of sleep before my alarm clock went off again. The fair was officially opened today so I picket out some suitable clothes, shaved and met up with my boss. We are doing free security audits  so I bothered potential customers all days, getting them to exchange business cards, get them interested in our services, products etc. Tomorrow I plan to ride around the fair on one of those push cart thingies... in a penguin suit.<br><br>
/me waves to Els and whoever she passes this on to.<br><br><b>*</b> I submitted a bug report/patch for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Lingua-31337/">Lingua::31337</a> to get this 31337 script thingie.<br><br><b>Note to myself:</b> Call her for that drink</p>
