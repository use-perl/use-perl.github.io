<p>Last week was my fourth week at the company and it has been quite hectic. In an attempt to make my work schedule more accurate, I plan to write down everything I do at work so my boss doesn't complain afterwards. Last week, I mainly called local libraries to check if they were interested in a demo for a nice product. I went on-site on friday with my boss and collegue. It was a long day... probably because I got up with quite a head ache. The RAID server I had been cursing at all week still wasn't fixed. Today I discovered one of the disks was quite fscked. Anyway, I called Ann, Eveline and Ulrike last week. It was nice talking to Eveline again since it's been quite a while since I spoke to her. She moved to Gent with her boyfriend and changed jobs in the mean time. She has her birthday on the same day as me. only 2 years later. When I spoke to Ann on thursday, she apparently had a problem with her jaw. It might be dislocated and apparently she has surgery planned next month. To make things worse, she has back issues again. On the bright side, she decided which school to attend and everything is great with her new boyfriend. Last but not least, Ulrike was not at home when I called her. I had a pleasant chat with her mom and later got a mail from Ulrike. She hopes to move into her new home by this week. <br><br>We got some nice toys at work. Fujitsu-Siemens and our local hardware deader sent over a nice box as well. Our lab guy is planning a test on those boxes. In the mean time, they assigned me a Delphi project. I really have to brush up on Pascal. It's been a while but I remember all the fun I had. Pascall was the first programming language I learned.<br><br>
I finally sent out most of the invitations. I wanted to send some actual cards as well but it appears quite tricky to find cards of <a href="http://www.artchive.com/artchive/M/munch.html">The Scream</a> by Edvard Munch on short notice.<br><br>
Note to myself: Get nice birthday card for Eveline and send it!</p>
