<p>OK, I'll review it a bit more. Return of the King is really tying all loose ends together. You find out how Smeagol became Gollem, if Arwen really looks hot in that dress and why Frodo is stripped by Orks. There are some very nice battle scenes, great CGI scenes and plenty of useless killing. Anything else I tell you is a spoiler ofcourse.</p>

C'mon, I mean <i>really</i>, there is nothing you can say to give away the plot.<br> <br>  I mean, who hasn't read LOTR  at least 5 or 20 times?<br>  I've clocked in 32 times since I was 15...<br> <br>  I really enjoyed the first movie, skipped the second after they brought up some "love" scenes, and have fairly little intention of seeing the third, since they cut Saruman out of it.<br> <br>
At least until some day in the distant future when I buy the three movie DVD set. (Have to get a DVD player first, one of these days.)

They had to cut Saruman, at least at the end.  There is no theatrical way to have this huge battle, and all these resolutions, take three hours, and then make the people sit in the theater for another 30 minutes to show the scouring of the Shire.  It could not work in a movie.<br> <br>However, it is extremely likely the Voice of Saruman chapter will be back in the extended edition.<br> <br>The love scenes in tTT were incidental, and didn't change the story at all.  I was far more annoyed at what they actually changed, like the Ents not knowing about the devastation of the forest, like the fall off the cliff of Aragorn, like the elves arriving at Helm's Deep, and -- worst of all -- Faramir taking Frodo to Osgiliath.<br> <br>Although, I am confident Faramir will hook up with Eowyn in the extended version, since they showed them together in the film version, but didn't explain why they were together.
