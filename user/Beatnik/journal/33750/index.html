<p>I don't get people and roundabouts. Every time I see cars driving up to a roundabout, I see about half of them lighting up the wrong indicator light. In the civilized part of Europe (*grin*), you turn right onto the roundabout. IMHO that means that you should use your right indicator light (right light as being the one opposed to both left and wrong). When you get off the roundabout, you also turn your right light on (or even leave your indicator light blinking while you make the turn). Turning your left indicator light on would mean that you're taking the roundabout into the wrong direction. Getting off the roundabout with the left light on would mean that you would crash into the fancy artwork that most of these pseudo-intersections have these days. <br><br>Don't get me started about the correct use of indicator lights on the freeway. For a person who spends about 3 hours a day in the car, I see my fair share of bad driving and near collisions.</p>

In the civilized part of Europe<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-&gt;  you indicate to the left that you wish to travel a looong way around the roundabout. Thus letting people know your intentions.<br/><br/>Indication to the right that you wish to enter the roundabout is meaningless - what else would you do?

Well, they recently abandonned the idea of using the indicator to drive onto a roundabout.. but I'd never use my left light to exit one tho. Doesn't Danmark fall under the civilized bit as well?

<p>.... has <a href="http://www.highwaycode.gov.uk/17.htm" title="highwaycode.gov.uk">this</a highwaycode.gov.uk> to say about roundabouts.</p>



<h2>right means you *leave* the roundabout</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Juerd/">Juerd</a> on 2007-07-09T11:15:04</h3>
(describing counterclockwise roundabouts)<br><br>Signal right to indicate you're exiting the roundabout. This lets others enter it much earlier, and warns pedestrians.<br><br>Not signalling means you're staying. Some people choose to signal left, to avoid ambiguity with people who don't signal at all.<br><br>As for signalling before entering the roundabout: left usually means you intend to go 3/4, right means you're leaving at the first exit.

I don't see how this can be explained unambiguous in the traffic rulebook. Blink once for left, twice for right?

I have no idea why you're talking about once or twice.

All roundabouts are clockwise, and all Europeans are confused.
