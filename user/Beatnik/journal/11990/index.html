<p>Well, for the past 2 days, I've been sleeping late... VERY late. Thank god for that EXTRA long weekend so I can sleep late. I got <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a> 9 so I'll be removing my Windows partition completly, backup my RH8 installation and go for a full reinstallation in the next few days. Ofcourse, this isn't really a good idea right now but what the heck. <br><br>
If I seem a bit distant, quiet, down, blue, sad, angry, upset or psychotic the next few days... I'm not. I'm just quiet :D<br><br>
I'm happy to have really good friends, people I can talk too (even tho we have some history together). <b>Thank you for being there for me</b>, those who read this and those who don't.<br><br>
In other news, Ann is considering a tattoo. Anyone have any good/bad experiences with them? Things to look out for? What aboot those temporary tattoos? Are they worth considering?<br><br>
The corny love songs have stopped but now I see beautifull blond women everywhere, some having sex... <b>*ARGH*</b>. Thank you TV for occasionally ruining my day.</p>

<h2>Regarding tatoos</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/BooK/">BooK</a> on 2003-05-12T15:01:52</h3>
<p>I'd love to have a tatoo... if it wasn't
permanent.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt>
The fun part is in change. I cannot see any
design that I can be absolutely certain I'll
still like ten years from now.</p>
<p>Haircut and colour give you some room for
change and experimentation.
And a guy can also have some fun with his beard too, and try new patterns now and then.
The greatest part of all that being: when I don't
like it anymore, I can get rid of it within a
few days.</p>
