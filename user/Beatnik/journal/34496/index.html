<p>After my talk in Vienna, an australian guy approached me and recommended that I take a look at <a href="http://www.webgui.org/">WebGUI</a>. It apparently had similar features to what I was talking about. Since then, I only briefly opened up the tarball and read some documentation. Once of the first things that struck me is the fact that they include Apache, Mysql, Perl, ImageMagick, AWStats and a bunch of small utilities in the same package. I talked about this in #webgui and some of their reasoning makes sense.. Some of their other reasons made me shiver a bit. Apparently, Damian mentioned this practice in a talk at OSCON last year?? One of my co-workers called it Microsoft-like. AFAIK their most important reason for packaging the whole deal and not just their perl code, is that they had specific requirements and wanted to guarantee that it worked as they expect it to be. They offer a source package but recommend the "binary" package. I'm biased towards that particular aspect of WebGUI but they seem to have some other interesting things in there. More to come</p>
