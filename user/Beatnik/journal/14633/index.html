<p>Well, today was a good day at work. I got fired. Ofcourse, that's what some believe. In fact, while I was fired, I was out of the office doing some errands. By the time I got back, one of my cow-orkers approached me and said "You're fired" while grinning. Apparently I called the guy a silly twat and he fired me. I know and he knows that it's all just to be funny but apparently a few of my friends didn't know and asked me why my away-message was "Just got fired". I didn't put it there and neither did I have the conversation in one of those IM message boxes, but someone did :) Just to be sure, the cow-orker did confirm I was not fired but now I had to explain to friends why this happened...<br><br>In other news, the tux on guard posters are ready so you might see the digital version spreading around on the internet. It's an angry looking tux with "HIER WAAK IK" at the bottom. </p>
