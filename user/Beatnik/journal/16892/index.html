<p>I spent the night at a co-workers house.. since I was too drunk and it was too far to go home. I got volunteered to entertain one of the women present.. a dutch girl named Sue. She was actually pretty cute (but not as loud as expected). We had some great lasagna (note to myself: exchange recipes) and some wonderfull tiramisu. I tried some 15 year old Glennfiddich whiskey... not really my thing. I also smoked a water pipe.. with PLAIN tabacco.. and it was quite nice. By the time we got to bed, it was around 2 AM. The guestroom has a few terrariums in it with a few geckos. Apparently you can see right through their heads. I woke up a few times in the middle of the night. I'm not entirely sure it was because of the geckos or the servers running in the same room...</p>

<h2>Tiramisu</h2>

Funny to read "we had some tiramisu with a girl" -- do you know the actual meaning of this word? Anyway.



<h2>Geez... now you made me... CURIOUS!</h2>

<p>After a search on webster and google I came up with the following definition for tiramisu:</p>

<blockquote><div>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; she continued casually. &#8220;Did you know that the literal meaning of Tiramisu is &#8216;pick-me-up&#8217; and that Venetian courtesans used to eat it before their gentlemen arrived for the evening because they believed it would give them the energy to make love all night?&#8221;</div></blockquote>

<p>The literal meaning is true, though I don't know about the venetian courtesans.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
