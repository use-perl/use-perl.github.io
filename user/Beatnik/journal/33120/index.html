<p>A few weeks ago, I took my girlfriend to a carnival fair. They had all kinds of rides, one of them being a centrifuge where you'd step in. Basically, it's a half-open cylinder. You step in, stand against the wall and the cylinder starts spinning. By the outbound force, you're pressed again the wall. At a specific speed, the floor drops and you're basically hanging in the middle of the wall. My girlfriend agreed to go on it but she quickly realized it wasn't her cup of tea. The spinning only lasted for a few minutes but she spent all of that time with her eyes closed and holding my hand. Her brother and his son, who also joined us in the centrifuge, were enjoying every second of it by trying to make silly positions while being stuck to the wall. When the spinning slows down, the floor doesn't come up again so you're slowly sliding down the wall. All I can say is: Freaky!!</p>

When I was growing up, Six Flags Over Texas had a ride like that called "Spindletop".  I'm not sure when they took it out but it was always my favorite.

<p>I came here from RSS specifically to post about that ride.  I loved it!  My dad introduced me to it, but then quit riding it with me because it made him sick.  I always watched him watching me at the top of the ride, though.</p>

<p>They took it out when they put in the Texas Giant.  I believe it was somewhere around where the entrance to the Giant is, now.</p>

<p>Six Flags today is a shadow of its former self.</p>

They have decreased the number of rides and shows while increasing the number of vendors and games.</p>

<p>I actually never liked the shows.  And I've never visited the games.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  But I've only been to Six Flags about three times in the past ten or fifteen years.  I just know that every time I go, it's disappointing.</p>

<p>The increase in rollercoasters while decreasing all the other rides bothers me, as does rebranding many of the rides.</p>
