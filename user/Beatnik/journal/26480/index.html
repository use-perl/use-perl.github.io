<p>I'm working my way through Dan Browns first book: Digital Fortress. The books discuss cryptography at the NSA. I suck at crypto stuff but I've noticed a few errors. For one, ZIP is not an encryption algorithm. More comments later :)</p>

<h2>Awful book</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brianiac/">brianiac</a> on 2005-08-28T03:42:18</h3>
It was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMFXBPG1OCT8W/ref=cm_cr_auth/103-6951602-9424624?_encoding=UTF8" title="amazon.com">my first Amazon review</a amazon.com>, just yesterday.



<h2>crypto</h2>

Your luck that you suck in crypto. You would *really* hate the book otherwise.



<h2>Digital Ignorance</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/duff/">duff</a> on 2005-08-29T15:52:36</h3>
I read Digital Fortress a while back and thought that it was poorly written.  The technology aspects in the story seemed stretched to cover the author's ignorance.  I remember being quite disappointed at the time because I'd heard that Dan Brown was a good author.<br><br>However, I did quite enjoy Angels and Demons.  There were fewer faux pas and the story was decent.  Maybe he should stick to religious conspiracy theories as those seem to work well for him (I have yet to read The DaVinci Code though)

So far, I'm not as impressed as I was with Angels &amp; Demons.. not that I was impressed per se<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

first of all, sorry about my english, it's been so long since i hace written in english<br/><br/>my oppinion: poorly written?? It's a ****<br/><br/>I'm from Spain, europe, i am not a spaniard and i'm tired of reading about american people who thinks Spain is in the north of Africa, We are european!!!!<br/><br/>I don't know what Mr Brown thinks about spain but in this book it looks like i'm living in somalia.<br/><br/>When dan brown is talking about sevilla he says we have the people laying on the floor in the hospital while we play basketball. who the hell he thinks we are!!?????<br/><br/>After that scene in dante's hospital,  a character in the book goes to the Triana neighborhood where, according to dan brown, all the drug sealers live... WHAAATTT?????? Triana is the place where anyone can find all the art, music and historical places of sevilla, dan browm thinks is a suburban zone!!!!.<br/><br/>More stupid things:<br/><br/>- the blueberry juice is not a traditional drink, we don't never drink that shit<br/><br/>- The book says: "the communion! the damned spanish toke the communion at the beginnig!!" damned spanish??? please mr brown, try to read something you have not written, the communion is the last thing the spanish people do in the church.<br/><br/>- according the book a lot of tourists have died triyng to climb "la giralda" of sevilla because it has no bannisters... NOBODY HAS DIED IN "LA GIRALDA" MR BROWN!!!! And we are not going to perforate a national monument because you want a bannister!!!!
- "in spain you can not ask for responsabilities" ok... whatever... we don't have police, justice or anything.... we only drink blueberry juice and kill tourists....
