<p>Five Things You Didn't Know About Me 
<br><br>
It took me quite a while to compose a list of things.. It's definitly not as interesting of some of the other ones I've seen. 
<ol>
<li>I have something with politicians. I'm related to at least 3 big figures in the belgian political world. The first one is a second cousin of my grandmother. His son is also a politician and currently a secretary in the flemish government. On the other side of my family, through in-laws, I'm related to a contraversial republican. I went to elementary school with the daughter of a former long-time belgian secretary. His father was prime minister for quite a number of years.
</li><li>I first went snowboarding a few years ago. When my then-girlfriend and I were on a break-in-being-a-couple, I booked my first snowboarding trip. When she found out, she was pretty pissed because she didn't want me to go. As a matter of fact, when I asked her before the break, she stated that I wasn't allowded to go. Soon after booking, we got back together but she dumped me days after getting back from snowboarding.
</li><li>By the time I was 25, I traveled around Europe and halfway around the world. I visited Italy, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, Germany, Switzerland, the UK, Ireland, Luxembourg, America and Canada.. Usually for a 2 week period. My father works at the belgian railways and they offer holiday packages as a benefit.
</li><li>When I was 14, I still had 2 of my great-grandmothers, both from my mother's side.
</li><li>I've missed only 2 YAPC::Europe's so far: YAPC::Europe 2000 (London) and YAPC::Europe 2005 (Braga). I share these missed conferences with Jos Boumans. Somehow I didn't remember Jos' fiancee when I saw her again at YAPC::Europe 2006. I don't know why. I'm still confused how CLKao knew who I was when I talked to him the first time during YAPC::Europe 2006. I did know who he was although I only started using SVK AFTER I met him.
</li></ol>

I am also one of the (large?) group of euro-perl-hackers who have only missed London and Braga.<br/><br/>You must be following me around<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
