<p>*UGH* Lots of stuff happened since my last post.. VERY quick summary: Wii (Sports, Play, Far Cry, Johnny Lee, DarwiinRemote), Snowboarding (Le Corbier, French Alps, Jagermeister, Schnapps, lots of snow), work (new co-worker, some old ones leaving [close friends, they will be missed]), New years.<br><br>For 2008, I'm focussing on getting some certificates.. I started my quest by looking into the famous preparation sites (you know.. PDFs, test engines and shit). I've come to the conclusion that they're pretty much all scams. Prime example: Test King. There appear to be half a dozen sites with alike sounding names (testking-world, testkings, test-king, testsking,..) in a couple of TLDs. They all offer different pricings and different preparation material. I decided not to throw my CC information up for grabs to any russian, indian or chinese hacker that was clever enough to download a website template and threw in some forms for fun and profit. <br><br>I still haven't looked into fixing the mod_perl2 issues (or whatever I'll end up calling it in my 5 minute LT I'll submit for YAPC::Eu anytime soon now) but I took another jump into the unknown with Bootcamp. I dug up an 'old' XP CD and fired up the installation process. It all went relatively smooth and after inserting my Leopard CD and installing all the necessary drivers, everything seems to work just fine. Thanks Steve.<br><br>During my week of isolation, the only news that got through from the 'real world' was that Steve had introduced this very thin laptop. The new Air looks nice and spiffy.. steep price tag but technically promising (not sure about the keyboard coloring though).<br><br>As of January, my girlfriend and me started looking for a place to live (together that is). For now, it'll be a rental but at some point we hope to buy. So far, no luck but a few places that look nice and we hope to see for a second time. To be continued..<br><br>
Closing word: John, John, Jeff.. I'll miss you guys. I apologize as a representative of the 10 million of us. </p>
