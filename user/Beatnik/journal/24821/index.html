<p>I'm quite sure there is a truckload of money to be made as IT consultant in Hollywood. I'll try to use a recent example on how incredible some shows get.<br><br>Tonight's CSI::Miama episode was about how a customer from a pr0n site was murdered.  The way they take 10+ seconds to do a Whois query (while showing cycling IP addresses) is just silly. It also appears that they have these strange type of IP address, not existing of 4 octets but of 6 (six) 4 (four) digit numbers. The way they restored a formatted hard drive was quite impressive. What was more impressive was that they were only able to restore 5 files : 3 web pages ( complete with images.. go figure) and 2 emails. They used some fancy GUI based tool which all seemed a bit too funky for my liking. They analysed the e-mails and were able to tell that one e-mail was authentic and the other one was "<i>forged</i>" which "<i>is kind of obvious</i>" and refered to the different IP addresses.<br><br>Weither or not these types of <i>college dorms</i> exist (or are they just sets) is left to the imagination of the reader.</p>

<p>I also saw this episode. I thought they were using those strange IP adresses for the same reason all phone numbers start with 555-*...</p>

Well, yeah but don't forget about reserved IP ranges. They could've easily used one of those.
