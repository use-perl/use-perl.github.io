<p>OK, I've had it. Ever since I installed RH8, it's slowed down daily. I rebooted 3 times yesterday because Galeon decided to eat all my memory. Evolution slows down when it gets more mail and I even stopped using Nautilus. I'm installing RH9 with fluxbox ASAP. Metacity is nice but I'm going for the simpler WM. Now all I need is memory.</p>

Heh, try running top in gnome-terminal.  That was chewing up a meg a second for a colleague of mine.

<p>The only thing I've seen that eats memory quicker is a perl script to create circular refs in an infinite loop...

Linux isn't just RedHat. There are a lot of options to pick a good one from, and RH just isn't a good one. I'd even say it's a very bad one.<br> <br>Try Debian or Gentoo if you feel like experimenting (or a stable workstation).

Actually, back in 1997 when I got my RH 5.2 CD from Maddog, it was quite nice (even tho I trashed it regulary for not knowing how to use it). I use Debian at work and actually attempted to install it on my laptop. All I can say is that uhm I'm not going there again. I'm comfortable with RH. It's stable enough and I don't want to spend days looking for things that the system needs. Instead I'll spend days looking for things I need on the system. I confess installing RH8 and leaving it the way it was installed was a big mistake. I have flux on my desktop and it works good enough for me. I'll have some free days in 2 weeks so I'll abuse those for some installing. I need to ditch that NTFS partition anyway<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-p
