<p>Well, my second week on the job is just over. It's been quite educational and I learned quite a few things. I'm also more confident in handling customers and discussing products. <br><br>There was an open source event last night. Quite a few companies had people there. Most important bit of the evening... the drinks afterwards. I was not all that impressed. For the past week, we have a Fujitsu -Siemens prototype of a webpad and for some odd reason we didn't really attempt to install linux on it... Ofcourse today we did. It only took about an hour. I'm sure my boss will have loads of fun with it over the weekend. In other news, I worked a bit longer on the whole virus research story. I picked up the source to Slammer, MSBlast and Sircam somewhere. SoBig.F seems to be quite difficult but I'm always open to suggestions on where to find it :)<br><br>Six months after <i>First Contact</i>, I've finally decided to move on. This has been a wonderfull experience but I notice my effort to make someone happy are not successfull... With Ann on the other hand, everything is just fine. <br><br><a href="http://www.johnandjohn.nl/">John and John</a> is now on my daily cartoon list. <a href="http://www.johnandjohn.nl/comic.asp?episode=052">This one</a> is particulary touchee...</p>
