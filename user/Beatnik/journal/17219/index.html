<p>One of my old classmates is getting married in a few months. I just got the invitation in the mail.  It's addressed to me and partner.. Does that mean I have to bring a date or actually will have to find a girlfriend.. Social obligations *SIGH*</p>

<h2>Don't bring anyone</h2>

No, it means that your friend didn't take the time to find out what your non-existent partner's name is, and used the shorthand "and partner."  The "and partner" is interesting because it implies "I don't want you to just bring a date", which is certainly understandable, but then they should have found out the actual name of the person, or that there wasn't one.
<p>
Wedding invites aren't the place to say "please come to my wedding, and bring up to one other person."</p>

At my wedding, we in fact invited significant others only when we knew them.  For example, my wife's sister's children's father (!) was invited, but my brother's new girlfriend was not.<br/><br/>This raised such a stink that we had to invite her.  So, my brother ended up not staying with the family.  We didn't see him much, we didn't talk to his date at all, and a few months later they broke up.<br/><br/>So, I wonder:  why would anyone want to invite "and partner?"  I guess if it's a big wedding where you can't possibly spend time with everyone...

<p>
The answer is "you don't."  Otherwise, you're going to get random new {girl,boy}friends, or worse, some guy from the office who got suckered into going so the real invitee doesn't go stag.</p>

IMO you be the judge. Your relationship with the other person is none of the other people's business, but I think you should bring someone who <em>you</em> personally comfortable with, and you would like to have around at a party. But don't feel forced. I don't think it's the time to bring a blind date...
<p>Weddings are supposed to be fun, not only for the newlyweds and their close relatives, but for the invitees too.</p>

Unless something extremly strange happens within the next month or so, I'm going stag.
