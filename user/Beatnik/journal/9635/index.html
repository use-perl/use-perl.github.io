<p>For some reason, I really wanted to get my webcam working again... after 2 minutes of kernel reconfigurring and 20 minutes of recompiling, it worked right away. I have one of those old Connectix sphere shaped QuickCams, which is still pretty good :) I've been using <a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/user/reynolds/cqcam/">cqcam </a> on my box since uhm always and since I was up for a good challenge (I don't know why, it's not like I have time to spare), I decided to start porting the cqcam code to perl thru XS. After 2 minutes of browsing thru the code, I realized it was in fact C++ code and I'd have a bit of a mess getting that to work properly. <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> gave me a link to <a href="http://www.johnkeiser.com/perl-xs-c++.html">Gluing C++ And Perl Together</a> page and I expect I'll be reading that one numerous times of the next weeks. My C++ skills arent that good but I do have a reference guide within hands reach and loads of <i>free</i> time (mmmm whatever happened to that Java project?? It's still there, waiting to be finished... OUCH! SH*T! Damn! uhm problem... well, it's not like I have a life to waste time on :) ).<br><br>Anyway, if things work out oki, I'll have a module on CPAN within X weeks... I'd still need a good name for it, so suggestions are welcome :)<br><br>I did ask <a href="">Extending &amp; Embedding Perl</a> for X-Mas (which would probably help my alot in my XS quest) but since I didn't get all my presents yet, I'm not sure I'll get it :| I did get some nice Sony Headsets.</p>
