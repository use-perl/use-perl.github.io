<p>The past few days have been uhm uhm weird. Studying at full speed, finding just enough time to have some fun. I went for a drink with some friends yesterday (1976 wine + some port = fun evening). Ann was also in a good mood, caught her on the phone while she was celebrating her 19th birthday in a local bar. She seemed happy with my present. Today was all about the barbecue at that linux shop I worked at the past 3 months. It was fun seeing all those people again, although it's been only 5 days since I left. <br><br>
To my (former) boss: I can't help it if those women need some assistance just before you walked in. I was only explaining them techie stuff, I swear. It's not like they're begging me :p I don't have a clue why they want to check my webcam feed all the time.<br><br><b>YAY</b> Studying just is a tad more fun when you realize you only have to learn the first half of the textbook. I'm nearly finished then...</p>
