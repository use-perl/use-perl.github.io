<p>After a week in the lovely mountain village of <a href="http://www.avoriaz.com">Avoriaz</a>, I got back home. The day we arrived, it was minus 18 degrees (celsius). After that the temperature went up and we even had bright sunshine yesterday and the day before. It snowed non-stop from tuesday evening til wednesday evening and the powder snow was excellent. We went to a live music bar on tuesday and it was flooded with danish people. <a href="http://www.funkydivaz.dk">The Funky Divaz</a> were performing and they look hotter in person :) We had some belgian beer and went to bed late (midnight is late if you have to get up at 7 uhm mmm uhm nevermind). The internet cafe was expensive but worth it for keeping in touch with some important <i>people</i>. During my stay, I
had a few job related calls and made some appointments.<br><br>I bought and brought along 2 books to read on the way. The first one was a reference guide to french grammar. Somehow I feel like it might come in handy. The second one is <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/0596006519/">Programming Jakarta Struts</a>. For those of you who don't know what Struts are (quite normal if you don't), Struts are a web framework in Java. It allows you to (ab)use the MVC principle and the existing 
900 classes to write a website that would definitly take you far less time, code and banging your head against the wall if you did it in another language. I never actually looked at MVC but I've been doing that stuff for quite a while now in other languages. Struts itself is bloated and I kept asking myself "WHY" while I was reading. I remembered why I didn't really liked how they were trying to get Java to do just about anything.<br><br>
New addiction: Tartiflette (which I couldn't find in <a href="http://www.astray.com/recipes/">acme's recipes</a>. It's sliced potatoes, sliced onions, reblochon cheese and bacon.</p>
