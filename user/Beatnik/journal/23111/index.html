<p>I had my second interview today. This was the one for which the HR person called me on a sunday.. while I was on a slope in France. Later that evening she mentioned stuff like .NET too. Today, it turned out the application in question was developed in <a href="http://www.omnis.net/">Omnis</a> (all who know/heard about this, raise your hand). The team itself consists of 2 people and they needed a semi techie guy for first line support, testing, documentation and training. The actual job requirements were VERY vague ("have experience in IT", "being very communicative"). No real details on what languages were required etc. During the interview, I was asked what languages I used and liked but I doubt the HR person had any idea what I was talking about. The talk in general was very vague and very short. I'll hear news next week.</p>
