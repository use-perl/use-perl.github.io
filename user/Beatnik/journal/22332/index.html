<p>For a laptop test we asked (and got) tons of laptops from most laptop manufacturers. I did a quick test drive of an iBook. The GUI seems quite nice.. but I have this remark: WHERE THE FUCK IS THE DELETE KEY??!?!?? Also, I didn't find the shell.<br><br>I was actually impressed by Toshiba's Port&eacute;g&eacute; R100. It is FUCKING SLICK!<br><br>I'm aware I'm using profanity in this post but somehow I felt like it. To those who feel offended, I deeply apologize and would like to say... <b>Sod off!</b></p>

The delete key is at the top write.  It's hard to find, because it says "delete" on it.<br> <br>If you want Mac OS to "delete to the right" hit fn-delete.

Aah.. That must be why I didn't find it. I was looking for a button that said "Del".

I double-checked and didn't find any key that has any marking even resembling the word "Delete". I also checked for things like "Suppr" or "Supprimer" (for french). Either I'm going terribly blind or we're talking about 2 different types here.

Huh.  Ok, I am looking at my wife's G4 iBook as I type this.  The key at the far top right (can you believe I typed "write" before?) is F12/Eject.  To its left is a flat, then F11.  Below F12/Eject is a broad key marked "delete."  It's they key we'd call backspace on a PC.  To its left is += and below it are the right bracket and the backslash.<br> <br>Aha!  Googling for "ibook keyboard" images found this:<br>http://www.mujmac.cz/images/ibookg4_keyboard_big.jpg<br> <br>If you have that kind of keyboard (I don't know whose it is, although the site is Czech) it's the one with the long left arrow!<br> <br>As I'd said before, to make it delete to the right, hold Fn while hitting it.

You see... on regular, PC style keyboards, there are both backspace keys and delete keys. The first is often both marked "Backspace" and a long arrow pointing to the left. The delete key is often marked "Del" or "Delete". I never complained about the backspace key on that keyboard<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

...but Apple recognizes that the only time you'd ever delete rightwards is when editing text, and 'x' in vi already does that for you, so... they've saved space!<br> <br>Anyway, I knew what you meant, which is why I included the explanation of how to get a traditional "delete" keystroke.  Good luck deleting!
