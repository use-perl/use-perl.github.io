<p>The first day of YAPC started off pretty good. I arrived pretty late and missed most of the morning. I checked into my hotel at 11 AM. My roommate was nowhere in sight (probably at the venue already). I found my way to the CBSO and registered. I snuck into Cog's first talk and into the talk on Types in the Onion room. I tailed alongside with some dutch people for lunch and left a message on Tielmans cellphone. Still no roommate. We had lunch at a  australian style restaurant. I took the 'roo hamburger (something I'd regret later on because it gave me gas). After lunch, I finally tracked down my roommate. My laptop battery died on me only half an hour into the morning. I spend part of the afernoon in the BOF room, just to recharge and getting the Wifi to work properly. I attended chromatics talk on perl hacks (pretty cool but at record speed), the POE field guide talk (still a bit confusing) and eventually the Lisp talk (excellent and funny).
I met up with my roommate, headed of to the hotel and freshened up. We eventually found a lot of yapc people at Bar One and a smallish group headed up to find something to eat. We ended up at the italian restaurant next to the hotel (small detour). Also at the restaurant: Kane (+ new-ish gf, clkao, tim bunce, acme, eidolon and tielman and a bunch of other I know vaguely). Somehow clkao knew who I was (which in itself is quite bizar). Conversation during supper was nice. We all headed to the hotel bar afterwards.<br><br>Note to myself: Must look at SVK
