And what, pray tell, does (or did) <b>Media-Markt</b> sell? It looked like a Wal-Mart. Are people in Poland really that desperate?</p>

Media-Markt is a sort of German Wal-Mart for electronic items. You can get computers, stereos, hoovers etc. there.

Well, this is bullshit, we have MM (Media Markt) from a nice few years in Poland (second MM in this city), as well like other store's with electronics etc. You think that we<br/><br/>The only reason for what happen was cutted prices for things like digital camera's, tv's, , computer's stuff. We all have dumb people, so please don't generalize. I suppose that in every country people will do the same things in this case.

Well, I'm from Finland and have never witnessed anything like what happened in Media-Markt but I totally agree with you. There really are dumb people all over the world who just hoard cheap stuff for hoardings sake and do stupid things along the way<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br/><br/>Plus, if you had checked out the facts you'd noticed that the chaos resulted from a special night sale campaign that took place on January 9th which also happens to be friday. I don't know about you guys but on fridays people sometimes tend to drink a few beers after a hard days work and even get a little drunk<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;) No wonder that it resulted in this kind of behaviour<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I'm of course exaggerating a little but it is quite obvious that the time and day had something to with the riot happening in the first place.
