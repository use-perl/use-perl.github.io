<p>Don't you hate it when cellphone bateries go dead in the middle of a call?? I was on my weekly chat with Ann when it went dead. I didn't get back to her for about 30 minutes, since I was walking and I had to get home first. To make things worse, I forgot my charger at work, so I can't get my cellphone bateries charged until monday. *ARGH*<br><br>Things are still pretty ok with that girl I met. (<b>YES, YOU!</b> I know you're reading this!!). Anyway, we have long talks about 3 times a week and we chat a bit when we see each other on-line. I saw this twinkle in her eyes the other day but I don't know if it's really one of those <i>happiness</i> things or just reflection of the light. She remains vague about that so I guess I'll have to look deep into her eyes again (YAY!). I like her a lot and I enjoy her company and I do get the feeling she feels the same thing.  Anyway, we'll see how things go.<br><br>
I got some balloons today, now all I need is some <a href="http://chemlab.pc.maricopa.edu/periodic/He.html">He</a> and I'm off to fill <i>someone</i>'s dorm room with hearts.</p>
