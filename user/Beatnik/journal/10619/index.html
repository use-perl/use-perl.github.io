<p>After a week on the slopes, I'm exhausted but happy. The snow was perfect, the weather not too warm and not too cold, my board was waxed and the slopes weren't too crowded. After a 10 hour car drive to Avoriaz, we parked our car around 2 PM, hijaked one of those weird busses that tour around and waited another 3 hours before we could check into our room. We had room 404 and the door plaque was missing uhm not found uhm missing. The snow was calling out... "Ride me!" "Ride me!". *UGH*. Somehow we postponed our first ride til the next day. We scouted the village and went to bed early. We got ski passes the next day and examined slope plans. The Portes du Soleil area goes all the way over in Switzerland (even reaching a small swiss mountain village called Torgon, which I visited about 12 years ago). We spent a day or 2 learning my brother's g/f a thing or two about boarding. A week was really way too short to board all the slopes and enjoy it so we made a small selection and stuck to em. Sliding down one of those clean, white, sparkling slopes really makes you feel like flying... either that or I just fell too often to even notice. The week went by fast and I miss it already. Avoriaz is a really nice station and I can recommend it. And yes, the DO have horse and snow carriages to get around town and NO, there are no cars allowed in the actual village.<br><br><br/><br/>It was Valentine's day on friday and while I was riding the slopes, the girl I love was about 800 kilometers away. I didn't send her a valentine's day card altho my postcard did arrive before/on the 14th and I did put some nice words on it. I still have mixed feelings of the whole thing. Oh well...<br><br>
I'm starting my 3 month internship at <a href="http://ba.be">Better Access</a> tomorrow. It's all part of the local Uni education system. I more or less profiled myself as a perl uhm <i>programmer</i> so we'll see how things work out.</p>
