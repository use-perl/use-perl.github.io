<h2>Is LPI Worth It?</h2>

<p>I assume you did the lower LPI exams before you decided to do 201? It's something I'm interested in, could you share your feelings with us about <a href="http://www.lpi.org/" title="lpi.org">LPI</a lpi.org>?</p>

<ul>
<li>What did you use as your study material- and was it useful?</li>
<li>How did you find the exams?</li>
<li>Has it been a useful learning experience?</li>
<li>Has it been useful getting the certificate?</li>
</ul>

<p>I would like to significanlty improve my Linux skills, and I'm hoping to push my employer to pay for RedHat training (we use RedHat for our web servers), but I'm interested in LPI too (I use Debian at home).</p>

I used common sense, experience, manpages and sheer luck... and I also found some exam questions online and tried a ton of those a few times (I can post link if you like). My boss is paying for the exams; I work at a Linux shop so it would be nice to have all techies certified. While preparing for 101, I did learn a few things that are quite handy. I only spent about 4 hours preparing. I figure that, if I spent more time, I could gain more from the preparation. Unfortunatly, 4 hours was all I could spare at the time (I was in the middle of a project at that time so there was no way I was going to have time to prepare on company time). If you get your boss to allow it, I'd recommend spending enough time on the preparation. There is a lot of information in there and the difficulty level of the questions (of LPI) were decent enough (compared to, let's say, a brainbench linux exam).

<p>Thanks for your comments, most useful. If you could post links to things you found actually useful that would be great. I read some of the sample questions on the LPI web site, and I thought I knew the answers to quite a few, but I'm not in a Linux shop, and I'm self taught, so I have no way of grading my own skills and abitities.</p>

<p>As we are using RedHat, and evaluating RedHat Enterprise for both our SAP and web systems, I would like to do RedHat training this year, possibly getting to RHCT, and RHCE next year. I would also like to do LPI at the same time, and I'm willing to pay for that myself, so that I can improve my Debian skills and abilities.</p>

<p>As in the recent Perl Certification debates I don't think that certification proves anything <em>per se</em>, but it does give me something tangible to aim for, and does keep mangelment happy!</p>

I used <a href="http://www.ph-home.de/linux-test/lpi-1/index.php" title="ph-home.de">this site</a ph-home.de> but IIRC it's only for 101 and not for 102. You can prepare best by reading a lot of manpages and howtos on categories defined in the <a href="http://www.lpi.org/en/obj_101.html" title="lpi.org">objectives</a lpi.org>. If you google a bit you might bump into preparation sites (try docs.msfree.ca).
