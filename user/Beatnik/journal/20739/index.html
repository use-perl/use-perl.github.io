<p>Summary of the past weeks: A. got a boyfriend and I'm super-happy for her (ignoring the fact that he'll get all the hugs now). Work is a bitch from time to time! I spent quite a bit of kwalitee time talking with K. about her break-up. We went to the movies (The Village is soso.. I've seen better but I've also seen lots worse), had a few beers and hugged a lot. I'm glad I can help. A. (other A. - there are 3) started exams today! She'll pass! I signed up for an evening course to get a teachers permit (while in the mean time my brother signed up for a Wine course and piano lessons). Dad left (and returned by now) to Canada. I ate 3 boxes of chocolate crisp cookies (in a period of 2 weeks). I got lenses (now looking superhot - according to some of my female friends... I doubt it but I feel better anyway). I got the Hannibal DVD and book (which describe nicely how the Firenzian square where I kissed F. back in 2001 was the scene for a hanging in the middle ages). I also got Trois Coleurs (which is kinda freaky but funny in it's own way)... In the mean time, I still haven't found what I was looking for! (candidates need to apply by e-mail)</p>

<p>So you'd be ignoring any personal applications from suitable candidates, even if they jumped on you and pinned you down until you acquiesce to their demands?</p>

Well, if they apply in person.. that's even better. In that case I can evaluate their assets better<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
