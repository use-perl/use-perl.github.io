<p>I'm ordering my Apple notebook this evening. I'm sticking to the 80 gig variation and I plan to get a memory upgrade after I get it. Belgian consumer laws specify that all vendors must provide at least 2 years of warranty on their products. The problem is that I won't buy this laptop as a consumer but through the company. I'm not sure weither or not that will give me rights to that 2 year warranty. Apple, by default, provides 1 year warranty (IIRC). Which brings me to AppleCare. When I look on the belgian Apple store site, AppleCare will cost me 319 euros. When I look at the US Apple store site, AppleCare will cost me 249 dollars. Is getting AppleCare worth it? Getting the package shipped to a US address isn't the problem but am I allowed to apply a US purchased AppleCare package on a european purchased laptop? If I get a memory upgrade, will AppleCare also cover this? Are there any other things that I should know about? Hidden expenses? Are there any accesoires that I also might pick up? What tools can you recommend? I'm a complete Apple newbie so bring on all that knowledge!</p>

I've gotten macs from the US before, with applecare.<br><br>Key is that you have to buy them in the US, or have them shipped to the US. Once a laptop had a motherboard issue and it got fixed in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.nl by Apple, without fuss.<br><br>This leads me to conclude that they honor applecare internationally, although I don't recall seeing that stated anywhere particular.<br><br>I'd say that if you're planning to keep the laptop for 3 years, apple care is worth it. Also, it's re-sell price goes up if it has applecare -- selling it after 2.5 years might be a good idea<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br><br>Lastly, the most essential accessory to a Mac is RAM, but you already figured that out<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

The thing is that I'm getting the laptop through work and AppleCare package in the US through a US PO box. I'm not sure if there is a difference but it's worth looking into. Is this possible? I'm gonna pass by the Apple store in the mall tomorrow.

I have been very thankful that I purchased it. I have an iBook that the kids are allowed to use and it gets a lot of wear and tear as you can imagine. AC has resurrected it a couple of times and I am sure what they have fixed cost way more than what the AC did.
