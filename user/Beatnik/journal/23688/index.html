<p>There have been quite a few series featuring gay men... Queer as folk is a bit strange (although one of my friends had small parts in some of the episodes), I just love Will &amp; Grace (although Karen is actually my favorite)... Recently, <i>the TV people</i> got me hooked on something completly different but still quite the same...<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0330251/">The L word</a>. Most men would jump to the chance of being in a threesome with 2 babes (for arguments sake, I will not confess or deny). It's basically all about women and men (mostly women) hanging out, having sex... basically living their own lifes.<br><br>Another example of how open today's society gets (or how smart/cash hungry <i>the TV people</i> get) is a reality TV show about a bisexual girl, looking for the perfect partner...They found 10 straight men and 10 lesbian women and put them in 2 Mexican villas. The woman visits both villas regulary and picks women (or men) on a <i>romantic</i> date. It isn't until late in the show that both groups find out about each others' existence.. It has all kinds of weird twists... jealousy, straight men falling for lesbian women, women ending up in bed together, men sneaking into the women's villa.. women sneaking into the men's villa. Somehow I doubt this idea isn't new.<br><br>I confess... I'm hooked to the fake image of perfect relationships the <i>TV people</i> project in my head.</p>

<h2>Turn off your TV</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davebaker/">davebaker</a> on 2005-03-17T01:52:25</h3>
Seriously. Turn it off, or even throw the damned thing away. Don't buy into the crap being served up on TV. It isn't real, it doesn't work in real life, it's bad for you.

<p>Finding someone of the opposite sex whom you can love faithfully and who will love you faithfully<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... having an intimate lifelong relationship with that person that results in babies who grow up to be more people whom you can love and who will love you<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... there's the real world, my man. Even though it doesn't make for "entertaining" TV.

</p><p>I'm speaking from experience; I loved Esquire magazine in my 20s, was a big-shot lawyer; got married, got obsessed with my job, got divorced, finally got religion, then got another wife with whom I learned to "stay in the canoe" and paddle together INTO the waves rather than trying to outrun them<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... now we have a 10-year-old son and we're a family. It beats all the attempted thrills of younger days. The stuff that passes for "relationships" on TV nowadays is practically criminal in its effect on the culture.

</p><p>IMHO<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Karen's the best part of the show.  Not that the rest of it isn't funny -- just that Megan Mulally gets all the best lines and has excellent delivery.

Did you know that when you're completely absorbed in what you're watching on TV, your brainwave activity is lower even than when you sleep? TV literally makes you stupid.

Does it lull you like watching a movie would?
