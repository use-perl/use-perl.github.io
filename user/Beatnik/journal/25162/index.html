<p>After seeing CNN explaining what blogs are and how they compete with regular <i>journalism</i> (if there is such a thing), I felt the sudden urge to write something. Today's topic is called system integration. Here goes...<br><br>One of the new features in Microsoft's MSN Messanger is a way to display what song you're playing. This does not only work for Media Player but also for, let's say, iTunes. Microsoft presumably designed some general API to notify which media is being played etc (ofcourse I have no clue whatsoever how they actually did it... I can only guess). The reason why Linux is never going to get something like this (although they DO have some very cool stuff), is that Linux is developed by individuals. Nobody is forcing you to follow this or that standard. There are tons of ways to get things done (e.g. a plethora of window managers, instant messengers, music players, ...). There are quite a few framework design groups. This can be a good thing.. but it can also be a bad thing. Sometimes your glass is half full, sometimes it's half empty. <br><br>Just to avoid CNN will ever pick this entry to get inspiration, it appears Fox is now the biggest news channel out there :)</p>
