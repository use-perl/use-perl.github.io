<div class="span8">
<p><p>So this week I finally got around to doing what I had been threatening to do for a long time .... wrap a <a href="http://poe.perl.org/">POE</a> framework around <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-YACSmoke/">CPAN::YACSmoke</a></p>

<p>Why would I contemplate such madness?</p>

<ul>
<li>I like POE >:)
<li>I wanted more control over what CPAN::YACSmoke was doing
<li>I could extend the functionality at a later date
<li>Just because ....
</ul>

<p>My main gripe with CPAN::YACSmoke was that if a particular module test 'hung' for some reason it would just sit there for hours until I happened to notice it.</p>

<p>So, I'd already 'borrowed' the article querying algorithm from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bot-CPAN/">Bot::CPAN</a> and adapted it to my own <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/POE-Component-Client-NNTP /">NNTP module</a> and reading AudreyT's <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/04/30/cpants.html">cpants article</a> set out to write something using POE.</p>

<p>The result is <a href="http://gumbynet.org.uk/poe/smoker.pl.txt">here</a></p>

<p>To use it you'll need:</p>

<ul>
<li>POE
<li>POE::Component::Client::NNTP
<li>Mail::Internet
<li>CPAN::YACSmoke + CPANPLUS
</ul>

<p>My only doubts have been with the recommended 40,000 second wait after a distribution has been uploaded before testing. Any advice would be gratefully received</p></p>

<p>I like it! I want it!</p>

<p>As for the 4e5 wait, I would suggest looking at <a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/henkp/mirmon/cpan.html" title="cs.uu.nl">CPAN Mirror Status</a cs.uu.nl> to look for the sweet spot of closest mirror most regularly updated fetch the goodies from that.</p>

<p>Or, what I would plan to do once I get my hands on your code, is that since I have a local CPAN mirror, I would just put the list of new modules into a queue.</p>

<p>Then, each time I refresh my mirror, I would smoke all the new distributions that have arrived, and cross them off the list. As I don't sync off funet, but rather a local mirror I tend to run over 24 hours behind, but I really don't think that's an issue.</p>

<p>After I posted the comment about the time delay I noticed some test reports from <i>imacat</i> hitting <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers" title="perl.org">perl.cpan.testers </a perl.org> that seemed to confirm the 11 hour wait.</p>

<p>You have given me much food for thought. I've also been giving the whole thing much thought, along the lines of interfaces to control what is happening within the daemon.</p>

<p>I'm away on holiday this week, so I shall have to ponder on it offline</p>
