<p><p>Or rather smoking certain CPAN modules can damage your perl</p>

<p>Andreas KÃÂ¶nig spotted it <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=30404">first</a>, but I have had two smokers destroyed in the past two days by smoke testing <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl-Dist/">Perl::Dist</a>.</p>

<p>If you are using a CPANPLUS/CPAN::YACSmoke smoker I would advise excluding 'Perl-Dist' for the moment using a <i>cpansmoke.ini</i> file:</p>
<pre>
[CONFIG]
exclude_dists=<<HERE
^Perl-Dist
HERE
</pre>

<p>Thank you for your attention.</p></p>

<h2>CPAN.pm smokers</h2>

Smokers using CPAN.pm based systems may use a distribution preference file:<p><blockquote> <div><tt>---<br>match:<br>&nbsp; distribution: "/Perl-Dist-\d"<br>disabled: 1</tt></div> </blockquote>

Uh, shouldn't the author of Perl::Dist be firmly kicked in the backside until he removes the harmful distribution from CPAN and uploads a fixed version?<br><br>

I'm the author of Perl::Dist, and I thought I HAD removed the destructive versions and uploaded fixed versions.<br><br>Which leads us to the position of...<br><br>How do you know your module is destructive to CPAN Testers until it is run by CPAN Testers?<br><br>It works fine for me, I'm just not sure what the hell it's doing to them that is so different... most of the destructive tests skip now...<br>

&gt; Become a CPAN tester and run your modules manually through the testing framework?<br><br>My release automation does run modules through test runs in a couple of variations (with and without AUTOMATED_TESTING, etc) but it apparently didn't catch it.<br><br>The problem turned out to be that you had CPAN.pm, running make test, running CPAN.pm, running make install (intentionally and correctly so)<br><br>The top CPAN.pm did some funny business with PERL5LIB, which interacted in a complicated way and resulting in the bottom make install pushing the files to the wrong place.<br><br>So Perl::Dist now overwrites and/or sanitizes all the environment variables used by the toolchain modules before it hands off to processes.<br>

And in fact, at one point CPAN.pm, running make test, running CPAN.pm, running make test, running CPAN.pm, running make test<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br>

I don't know if that means this is fixed already, or Perl::Dist will EITHER pass ok, or blow up the CPAN Testers setup...<br><br><a href="http://cpantesters.perl.org/show/Perl-Dist.html#Perl-Dist-0.06" title="perl.org">http://cpantesters.perl.org/show/Perl-Dist.html#Perl-Dist-0.06</a perl.org>
