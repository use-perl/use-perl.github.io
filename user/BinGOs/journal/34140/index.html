<p><p>Always loving a <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/drhyde/journal/34078">challenge</a> I decided to ramp up my smoke testing on <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a>.</p>

<p>I've rewritten my RSS feed based smoker script, which uses <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/POE-Component-CPAN-YACSmoke/">POE::Component::CPAN::YACSmoke</a> , to smoke against multiple perl installations.</p>

<p>I then compiled, built, tested, installed and configured perls 5.8.1 through to 5.8.8.</p>

<p>The smoker was restarted yesterday afternoon and is busily working it's way through the RECENT uploads list, whilst queuing up uploads that have occurred in the meantime.</p>

<p>I have also been adding perl-5.9.5 installs to my VMware based smoke boxes.</p></p>

<p>Not to put you off too much, but you have 2 competitors after you<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p>We're only halfway through the month and both are notably less than 2000 reports behind you. In fact so far this month there are almost as many reports posted for the first 15 days of August as there were for the whole of July!
</p><p>The <a href="http://perl.grango.org/" title="grango.org">stats</a grango.org> are going to make interesting reading at the end of the month.</p>



<h2>I know one way to help catch up :)</h2>

And it would be VERY useful.<br><br>Currently we SUCK with tests across a variety of Perl versions.<br><br>As it happens, one of the early PITA spin-offs is a debian sarge image with every single production Perl between 5.005_03 and 5.8.8 installed on it already.<br><br>If you had enough CPU time to spare, it would be terrifically interesting if you ran tests across the ENTIRE set of all 20 odd Perl versions.<br><br>Interesting for my anyway<br><br>
