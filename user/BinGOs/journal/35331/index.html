<p><p>I need to get some things off my chest that I have observed during CPAN smoke testing:</p>

<p><b>WHY OH WHY?!</b> do you insist on writing your own prompting mechanisms in your Makefile.PL? ExtUtils::MakeMaker, Module::Install and even Module::Build have a <i>prompt</i> function/method. Please use it. Either that or check whether <b>AUTOMATED_TESTING</b> and/or <b>PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT</b> environment variables are set and provide default values accordingly. 
</p>

<p>Does everyone who tests or installs your module really, really have to install Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage just to run your testsuite? Does anyone else, but you really care? Please learn to skip.</p>

<p>And finally, please, please, please don't try and install modules from your Makefile.PL using the CPAN API. I don't test using CPAN and I don't want your favourite module installed in my smoke testing perl, thank you very much. Oh and you are assuming that I have configured CPAN in the first place. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.</p>

<p>Love BinGOs</p></p>

I have felt your pain<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... and more. In fact I have a whole talk about it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Are the slides from your talk, or an mp3, available on the web?  Can you provide a url?<br><br>Thanks.

<p>See <a href="http://birmingham.pm.org/talks/barbie/cpanready2/index.html" title="pm.org">"Preparing For CPAN"</a pm.org>. Some of the slides need updating, and there is some additional information that needs an airing, but it gives several pointers to some of the problems encountered.</p>

<p>Sure, that's how you know we're serious about gaining two points in a meaningless benchmark designed to improve the quality of the CPAN!</p>



<h2>Test::Pod is meant for CPAN Testers</h2>

I don't know about anyone else, but CPAN Testers is the ONLY place I run Test::Pod other than my own machine. It's caught several bugs relating to chances in Test::Simple.
