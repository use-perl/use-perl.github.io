<div class="span8">
<p>I use Data::Dumper a lot when debugging applications that return complex data structures. However I'm not always happy with the pretty printing that Data::Dumper provides and I often find myself copying he structure into Emacs and running perltidy against it. 

<p>
As such I thought that it would be nice to have a Data::Dumper::Perltidy module that would do both steps in one go. I didn't find such a module on CPAN so I wrote <a href ="http://search.cpan.org/user/jmcnamara/Data-Dumper-Perltidy/lib/Data/Dumper/Perltidy.pm">one</a>.

It was also written out of frustration with the formatting of Data::Dumper (it does alignment on =&gt; too).

<p>Don't know.  I only tried the simple test below, and it did align the =&gt; signs nicely.  Maybe you are talking about something else:

</p><p> <code>perl -MData::Dump -we "dd \%INC"</code></p>
