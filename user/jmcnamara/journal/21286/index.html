<p>Well not quite with Larry. He was at the next table with his family.
<p>
I dined with Dave Cross, Casey West and some of the Italian Perl mongers. But we chatted afterwards and I even got a <a href=http://homepage.eircom.net/user/jmcnamara/perl/larry_and_johnny.jpg">photo</a>.
<p>
This was after the <a href="http://www.codejam.org/index.en.html">Italian Code Jam</a>. It was a great day. I really enjoyed Larry's talk which (I think) was entitled "What I have learned in my 50 years" although it had at least 10 other titles as well (including The Perl of Perl). It went on a windy path through ballistics, computer science, Perl culture and Lord of the Rings (eagles were Tolkien's exception handlers) to a destination of Perl 6.
<p>
I have been luke warm on Perl 6 up to now but the new syntax and functionality look great.
<p>
Needless to say he was asked the million LOC question; When will Perl 6 be out. Larry's answer paraphrased: alpha code next summer hopefully.

You mean, I met you too, and I didn't connect the person with the use.perl handle?  {sigh}

Sorry, I should have introduced myself. The opportunity came but went.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-(</tt>
<p>
BTW, are you going to post some of the pictures you were taking with that super-duper looking camera of yours.

I won't have decent upload bandwidth until after I get home, about 5 days from now.  Look for them then, under <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/Pictures/Trips/2004/" title="stonehenge.com">trips-2004</a stonehenge.com> somewhere.
