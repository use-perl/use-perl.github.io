<p>I just took a break from writing to watch a special on HBO. It's not a
terribly-recent special, it's one of the "America Undercover" series. This one
was on the topic of the proliferation of hate-based speech and groups on the
WWW. It was just <i>so fucking depressing</i> to see and hear these people
speak so calmly and literately about the inferiority of certain races, the
conspiracy of the government behind it all, et cetera ad nauseum.</p>

<p>And boy, did it ever add nausea to my evening. It's been over for an hour
or so, and I can't get it out of my mind. One segment that has stuck with me
was a woman, probably in her mid to late 20's, the sort I'd try to approach if
I saw her in a club or bar. My kinda look-- short, punky hair, eyes that
screamed attitude. But she was talking about the importance of having lots of
pure white babies to boost the numbers of the race. Balancing a toddler on her
knee, I couldn't help but wonder if that kid will be the next McVeigh or
clinic-bomber. One of the first people interviewed was the maintainer of
stormfront-dot-org (if you want to go there that badly, you can bloody well
type it in yourself). As bad as listening to him was, it was all the worse
when his 11-year-old son was talking about how and why he started the
"Stormfront for Kids" portion of the site.</p>

<p>I'm neither na&iuml;ve enough or flat-out stupid enough to think that the
human race will ever get along in 100% harmony, but it pains me to see that
some people have managed to not learn a damned thing from the last 60-75
years. It doesn't exactly fill me with confidence for the survival of our
species.</p>
