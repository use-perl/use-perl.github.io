<p><!-- posted by /home/users/rjray/bin/upj_post.pl -->
<p>I spent a good part of yesterday at the 2002 <a
href="http://www.caextreme.org">California Extreme</a> exhibition. It was like
the single-largest 80's-style arcade I'd ever been to. Games everywhere.
Games I remembered playing as a teen. Games I only barely remembered. Games
I'd never heard of. There were one-offs and prototypes that had never gone
into production (<a href="http://www.blackperl.com/b-and-b.jpg">Beavis and
Butthead, anyone?</a>). There were rows and rows of pinball machines, so many
that I couldn't resist <a href="http://www.blackperl.com/pinball.jpg">getting
in a few games</a>. Collectors brought their games in to be played, and
traders had various parts and widgets to sell. Boards, memory chips, display
banners, etc.</p>
<p>But the high point, both in coolness and in geekery, had to be the <a
href="http://games.lasers.org/">LaserMAME</a> set-up. This is a MAME system
built to output to a vector graphics board instead of the usual raster
graphics output. This is then fed to a laser projection system, and the result
is, well... <a href="http://www.blackperl.com/tempest.jpg">this</a>. Tempest
being played from 30-40 feet away, a "screen" that is 20-25 feet high.
<i>Using the side of the frickin' exhibit hall as the screen.</i><p>
<p>Of course I played it. How could I not? But the angle felt strange, looking
up like that. I spent most of my time playing old favorites from my wistful
high school years: Robotron, Scramble, Tutankham and I, Robot. I also made it
a point to visit Bezerk, Wizard of Wor, Space Dungeon and Pooyan. No Xevious
and no Lost Tomb, but they had Zaxxon. Sometime around 7:00 or so in the evening, they dimmed the lights to arcade-normal levels and cranked up the 80's rock-- Cheap Trick's "Surrender", Ramones, all the staples of the arcade experiences from my mis-spent youth. In all, I <i>easily</i> played more than $25 (the cost of admission) in games, assuming each was a quarter per shot.<p>
<p>They even had an original Pong, in the original cabinet. But I didn't play
it.</p>
<p><i>Thanks to Kevin Greene for the tip on the event, and the
pictures.</i></p>

A little late posting this comment but I only just read your post (sorry).<br> <br>This is how I spent the <b>vast</b> majority of my youth.  Video games (and arcades) were my <b>life</b>.  Personal faves (right off the top of my head and in no particular order of preference):  Gorf, 1942, Defender, Bubble Bobble, Gauntlet, Star Wars, Return Of The Jedi.<br> <br>Now if we could get one of these exhibitions in the Phoenix area - I'm <b>there</b>.
