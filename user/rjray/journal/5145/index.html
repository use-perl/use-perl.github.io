<p><!-- posted by /home/users/rjray/bin/upj_post.pl -->
<p>There was a time when I could configure and roll my own kernel in my
sleep. My first laptop always needed a custom kernel in order to properly use
APM. In those 2.0.X days, the PCMCIA system was separate from the kernel, and
could be built/upgraded completely independantly.</p>

<p>Alas, no more. I have been trying and trying to get a wireless set-up
working here in my apartment so that I could get away from the at-hand
distractions (TV, books, cats) while still being able to access my home
network (I keep a lot of docs archived on my desktop, served via
Apache). After two wireless cards and countless failures at editing
<tt>/etc/pcmcia/options</tt>, I gave up trying to get this to work with the
stock kernel from Red Hat Linux 7.3 (hell, when I started this mess, I hadn't
upgraded yet-- the upgrade was one of the attempts to get the laptop to
recognize a wireless card). I've tried building a custom kernel more so that I
could also build the latest <tt>pcmcia-cs</tt> release (3.1.33, as opposed to
the 3.1.27 that ships). I figured with kernel and pcmcia-cs source trees that
exactly matched my running kernel, I could either get the card to work
outright, or I could at least reliably build the <a
href="http://www.linux-wlan.org/index.html"><tt>linux-wlan</tt></a>
package. In the end, I wound up with a kernel that was emitting warnings
during boot, didn't load sound support, and I won't even own up to how many
tries it took me to get all the filesys stuff right.</p>

<p>Problem is, PCMCIA is now more-or-less integrated into the 2.4.X kernel
line. Only not <i>quite</i> completely, it seems. As such, <tt>pcmcia-cs</tt>
gets ooky when you try to build it. Other problems arise. And in the end, I
<i><b>still</b></i> don't have a working wireless set-up. It finally occurred
to me to boot the laptop to Windows and at least verify that the card and the
WAP were working. The WAP shows up on my network, but even when the status
monitor under Windows shows that the card is getting a signal from the WAP,
there was no DHCP traffic across the router. Efforts to get the WAP to use
DHCP to get it's network info don't work, so I set it to static network
info. But the card never seems to get DHCP packets to the router to get an ACK
back.</p>

<p>So for now, I give up. It's taken several days to accomplish this much
because I am still putting priority on the book. But I've done all I can
without totally immersing myself in Google searches and endless
config-build-reboot cycles. No more.</p>

<p>(For those who might be wondering, my WAP is a D-Link DWL-900AP. The first
card, which I exchanged, was a D-Link DWL-650. The current card is a SMC 2632W
V.2, which apparently has the latest firmware as I tried to update the
firmware using their Windows-based updater and it declined to update the
card. Both cards consistently come up in <tt>/var/log/messages</tt> as
"unrecognized" when inserted into a PCMCIA slot. All pages I've looked up on
either card imply that they work just fine for the people involved, without
editing any system files. But not for me, it would seem.)</p>
