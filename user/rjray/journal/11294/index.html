<p>If you come across someone's resum&eacute;, by whatever means, and you want
to talk to them about a position you are trying to fill, here's a thought:</p>
<p>Just because you can look up the phone number of the company he works for,
and just because they have a directory system that let's you connect to his
desk without talking to the receptionist, <i>does not</i> mean he will be
either impressed or particularly interested in talking to you <b><i>at his
desk</i></b>.</p>

*sarcastic grin mode on*<br>
Oh, come on...  I would have loved the opportunity to talk<br> to a head hunter about the kind of job I was looking for,<br> while at work.  I mean, what <b>else</b> did I have to do!<br>
And, no chance a supervisor might come in and hear me.<br>Or, god forbid, that my phone might be monitored.<br>No one would do <b>that</b>, right?



<h2>Home</h2>

I had a guy look up my home number and call me at home.  I asked him why he called my home number, he avoided the question.  I said I was not interested in a job, and he said "why is your resume online if you are not available for work?"  Some people are just stupid.
