I don't usually aggregate from there to here, but I wanted widest-possible
distribution.)</p>
<p>Thanks to the latest worm, I'm getting a renewed flood of junk e-mail. Most
of it is caught by my ISP's spam filter. But there is another contributor to
the madness, a source that probably didn't mean to be making the problem
worse. And yet...</p>
<p>I have seen a serious percentage of these e-mails that are not the actual
virus messages, but instead are auto-reply messages from spam filtering systems,
most often tied to SpamAssassin (as a loyal user, I also recognize the report
format). It looks like there are a lot of people out there who mean to punish
the spammers by returning messages to them, thus causing them the same level
of headache they cause (higher, in theory, since others are doing the same
thing). But that isn't working. How do I know this? Because <i>I'm not the one
sending the virus messages</i>.</p>
<p>These virus mails are going out because someone who got infected has me in
their addressbook. Sending me the auto-reply simply because that is the address
on the "From" line isn't doing anything (aside from making me a little bit
more annoyed). I understand the reasoning behind this-- hell, I've thought 
about doing something similar. But if I'm getting this many returns, then there
are certainly people out there getting even more than I have.</p>
<p>So if you are one of the people doing this auto-reply mojo, <b>please stop
it</b>. I hate to break the news, but I doubt that any spammers are going to
be truly moved by your efforts. Meanwhile, there are a lot of people who are
already getting more than enough useless messages because of the virus. At 
least the virus messages are caught by the filters. The replies aren't, because
they don't look like spam. So I'm getting <i><b>more</b></i> of this faux-spam
than I'm getting of the real thing. Please stop.</p>
