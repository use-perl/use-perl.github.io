<p><!-- posted by /home/rjray/bin/upj_post.pl -->
<p>In a move that leaves me scratching my head, it appears that the
W3C working group on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/desc/">next
version of WSDL</a> has
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wsdl/message/1018">decided to drop
support for overloaded operations</a> in WSDL 1.2. As near as I can tell from
reading through the
<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-desc/2002Jun/0247.html">archives
of their mailing list</a>, the intent is to move the specification of different
calling structures into the XML Schema that describes the type structure for
the document itself. The problems I have with this are several, but there are
mainly two that I'm most concerned with.</p>
<p>For one thing, XML Schema can be a great assist to a WSDL file, but it
shouldn't be required unless the interface is describing complex data. I
should be able to describe
<tt>add(<i>int&#160;A</i>,&#160;<i>int&#160;B</i>)</tt> and
<tt>add(<i>double&#160;A</i>,&#160;<i>double&#160;B</i>)</tt> as two versions
of an <tt>add</tt> primitive, without resorting to XML Schema. While it is
true that the WSDL is likely going to refer to those primitive types by
using the XML Schema namespace, it makes a difference to the applications
that parse the WSDL. And more importantly, there is a great difference between
an operation with several signatures (what Damian handily calls a
"multi-method") and an operation that takes a single extremely-complex
structured representation. They just are not the same. The argument that
it's <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wsdl/message/1032">up to the
toolkit to do the right thing</a> doesn't hold water. The toolkit should
present to the client of a web service an interface that resembles the
interface that the underlying code presents everywhere else. If I want it to
be different, I'll write it that different way to begin with.</p>
<p>The second argument, and the one that bothers me the most, seems to hinge
on the fact that overloading as presented in WSDL 1.1 is badly-documented
(which it is) and difficult to understand (which it also is). But that 
shouldn't be an argument for removing functionality. It may be difficult, but
it isn't impossible. I figured it out for
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pwebserperl/">the book</a>. Others
can, too. Or they can read my explanation. Either way, don't take away a tool
just because the "how-to" takes more than a paragraph or two to explain.</p>
