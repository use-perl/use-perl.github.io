<p>It seems that <a href="http://www.tellme.com">my company</a> does not
generally send people to conferences, even if they're tapped as speakers. This
is not a snub towards me in particular&mdash; there are people around here
that have to turn down invitations for the same reason, people who are more
highly-regarded in speech and VoiceXML circles than I can claim to be in the
Open Source arena. It's just a matter of expense and cold, hard numbers.</p>
<p>What they can do, are willing to do, is comp me for the day that I am
speaking. So, to do OSCON at all, I will have to pay my own way and then claim
it on my taxes next year as a business expense. To be there any more than just
the day I'm speaking, I will have to use vacation time.</p>
<p>I find these things sadly unfortunate.</p>

Is there something you could do for them while you're there?  Recruit potential employees?  Gather information on technologies your company is considering?  Maybe you can convince them that there's a business benefit to sending you there.

<p>Unfortunately, no. My boss' boss is the one I referred to, who has to turn down invitations to talk 2-3 times a year. And these are things that are <i>directly</i> related to our business, no coaxing or convincing required.</p>
<p>Now, it's down to a question of whether I drive or fly to Portland<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).</p>
