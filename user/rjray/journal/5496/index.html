<p>This is bad.</p>
<p>When I dialed-in to my ISP this afternoon and ran <tt>fetchmail</tt> among
the incoming messages were three notices of message delivery failures. One was
addressed to my <tt>svsm.org</tt> address, the other two were addressed to my
<tt>tsoft.com</tt> address. And all three were referencing messages I never
sent. Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>I never send from <tt>svsm.org</tt>. That's a domain I use to host a
website for my scale modeling club (SVSM stands for <i>Silicon Valley Scale
Modelers</i>), and I have the e-mail address as a link at the bottom of each
page, for feedback purposes. I <i>get</i> mail at that address, but any and
all replies, like all my outgoing mail, comes from
<tt>blackperl.com</tt>.</li>
<li>Likewise, I no longer send from <tt>tsoft.com</tt>. Even if I'm reading my
mail from a simple shell-login to my ISP, my configuration of my mail-reader
(<tt>mutt</tt>, if you're curious) sets all header to the blackperl
address. TSOFT was the original name of my ISP (they've since changed), and
while the address still works, I prefer blackperl because I'll keep that even
if I should change providers.</li>
<li>The send-dates on all the returned messages fall on or around 1:00 to
1:30, PM, local time this afternoon. I use dial-up access, and what's more
since I've been laid-off and working on my book full-time, I've slipped into a
weird work-schedule in which I tend to write until 5:30-6:00 AM, then sleep
until 2 or 3 in the afternoon. So today, I awoke at 3:00, started up the ISP
connection, then hit the shower while <tt>fetchmail</tt> and
<tt>spamassassin</tt> played their delicate duet over my incoming mail. I
wasn't even connected when these messages were sent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I've been getting tons of these virus mailings, most of which don't
match on <tt>spamassassin</tt>'s rulesets because they're all slightly
different, depending on which Klez flavor infects which acquaintence of
mine. I'm used to deleting them, as well at taking a smug sense of superiority
over the fact that <b>my</b> mail-program doesn't do silly things like
executing attachments through MS Word if/when I open them.</p>
<p>This means that someone is just using my e-mail addresses to try and start
an infection of on of these virii.</p>
<p>And <i>that</i> means it could be any of us whose e-mail addresses are
already mined by spammers, who get "used" next.</p>

<h2>Klez</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vsergu/">vsergu</a> on 2002-06-08T00:08:13</h3>
<p>This has been going on for at least several weeks. Klez (or at least some Klez variants) uses addresses it finds on the infected computer for the "From:" lines on the e-mail it sends out.  So your address could have been in someone's address book or even just in the messages or cached Web pages on an infected computer.  Here's what <a href="http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.klez.h@mm.html" title="symantec.com">Symantec</a symantec.com> says:</p>

<blockquote><div> <p>Because this worm uses a randomly chosen address that it finds on an <em>infected</em> computer as the "From:" address, numerous cases have been reported in which users of <em>uninfected</em> computers received complaints that they sent an infected message to someone else.</p> </div></blockquote>

<p>It also may send fake postmaster bounce messages.</p>

Yeah, I have received Klez messages "sent by" Larry Wall, Tom Christiansen, Matthias Neeracher, Mark-Jason Dominus, Lincoln Stein, Michael Schwern, Ilya Zakharevich, and more.
