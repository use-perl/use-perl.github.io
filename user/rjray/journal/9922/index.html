<p><!-- posted by /home/users/rjray/bin/upj_post.pl -->
<p>Over the course of the weekend, I've added support to the Base-64
handling within <tt><a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=RPC-XML">RPC::XML</a></tt>
for file-handles in place of static data, and also for serialization of
messages directly to an open filehandle (such as a socket) so that messages
created for my project at <a href="http://www.tellme.com">Tellme</a>, which
has to sling around encoded WAV files, doesn't choke the hell out of the
servers. (Re: my <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/rjray/journal/9899">previous
journal entry</a>.) I'm actually quite happy with it-- not only is it there
and relatively clean in appearance, I've added two more test suites to cover
the file-handling and serialization functionality. All told, I've added 40 new
tests to the package's test suite so far. More tests are always good.</p>
<p>With all this cozily checked-in to my CVS repository (because I'm exactly
that anal when it comes to personal code development), I then turned my
attention to the <tt>RPC::XML::Client</tt>, <tt>RPC::XML::Server</tt> and
<tt>Apache::RPC::Server</tt> classes. These are the consumers of the data
classes, after all. It is they that currently stringify the entire messages
to determine Content-Length and to set content in the LWP transport classes.
Can't be that hard to convert-- sure, it'll be tricky with
<tt>LWP::UserAgent</tt>, but it can be done. And both server classes give me
access to socket descriptors that I can pass directly to the newly-crafted
<tt>serialize()</tt> methods.</p>
<p>But wait... what's this? My compession support...?</p>
<p>It seems that I also use the fully-stringified message to determine if the
message should be compressed. If so, I compress it in-memory, and re-evaluate
the content-length after it's been compressed. I don't want to back-out my
compression support, especially not in this case where I <i>know</i> the code
I'm adding is specifically geared towards enabling larger messages.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm leaning towards a tied-filehandle package and making two
passes over the message when compression is enabled. The first pass would be
to calculate the length of the compressed stream, the second to actually
stream it. I'm poring over the man page for
<tt><a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Compress-Zlib">Compress::Zlib</a></tt>
to begin with, for now. Anyone who's done anything like this is invited to
offer advice.</p>
