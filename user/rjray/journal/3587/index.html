<p><!-- posted by Book/upj_post.pl -->
<p>The latest version of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>, version
0.9.9, is now <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla0.9.9/">out and
available</a> for download. I mention this only because of two particularly-cool
new features in this build: <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/">MathML</a> support,
and built-in <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/extensions/xmlextras/docs/Soap_Scripts_in_Mozilla.html">SOAP scripting</a>.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, this isn't Perl-related, as the SOAP scripting is done
by providing new classes to the JavaScript engine within Moz. But there will
be a Perl-relevant link soon enough-- I'm working on a JavaScript function to
place on my <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=143330">PerlMonks.org Home Node</a>,
that will cause the page (when viewed with a compatible browser, of course) to
use the SOAP interface here at <tt>use.perl.org</tt> to fetch my journal
history, RSS-like, and put it on the page.</p>
<p>On a related note, as I was reading in the ORA SOAP book about different
server-node environments, I was mildly amused to note that in order to develop
and deploy .Net services, you would have to be running IIS webserver. I guess
I'm not that surprised by this, I just suppose I assumed they would make the
engine more stand-alone. But that might seem like a silent endorsement of
running Apache on your NT machine instead of IIS. Heh.</p>

OK, that is really scary.  If the browser is what is doing this, what's to prevent you from forcing someone to post or delete an entry on their own account, since their browser will contain their cookie?<br> <br>Please tell me the auto-SOAP functions don't send browser cookies<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>

<p>Hadn't even considered that possibility. But then, I'm your proto-typical white-hat: my first thought when handed a new technology to play with is what creative things I can do with it. I have the luxury of not having to worry about server-side issues like you do<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).</p>
<p>I've been reading the docs on their SOAP API, and I've just re-read them again. There is no mention to either degree about cookies with an HTTP-based request. I will write the parties responsible, and ask for some clarification. When (if?) I get it, I'll post another journal entry.</p>

I deal with Slashdot users, my first thought when handed a new technology is to think how it might be abused.<br> <br>OK, OK, I was doing that long before I ever worked on Slashdot.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>I can't figure out how to reply, but that's the funniest sentence I've heard all day.</p>
