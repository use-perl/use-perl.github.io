<p><!-- posted by /home/users/rjray/bin/upj_post.pl -->
<p>As part of the work for the web services book, I've been writing some
slightly-larger examples of working with SOAP servers, specifically using
<tt>SOAP::Lite</tt>. Last night, I was delighted when the stuff I had written
worked like a charm with the server running from one xterm, and the client on
a second (but on the same host). So tonight, I rsync'd files over to a
separate machine, and (after a few embarassing typos) of course it works like
a charm. It's easy to forget how convenient and time-saving a good, clear
interface can be. I don't mean SOAP in general, I mean <a
href="http://www.soaplite.com"><tt>SOAP::Lite</tt> in particular</a>.</p>

<p>It's easy to forget because we easily become accustomed to using software
that is in perpetual alpha, or barely into beta. Look at Red Hat Linux, and
how many of the packages have version numbers that start with zero. It's not a
fault on the part of Red Hat-- if they want to offer packages like pan, PyGTK,
ORBit, etc., they have to use what they can get. Relying on open source means
relying on open source authors, and that means that sometimes even an "old
standby" like <tt>talk</tt> has a version of 0.17.</p>

<p>So, kudos to a clean, stable interface, even at the ripe young age of
0.55. What's more, I was able to launch the server with a one-line. A
fully-functional SOAP server in just:</p>

<pre>perl -MWishListCustomer -MSOAP::Transport::HTTP -e \
'SOAP::Transport::HTTP::Daemon->new(LocalAddr => myhost => \
LocalPort => 9000)->dispatch_with({ "urn:WLC-test" => "WishListCustomer" \
})->handle'</pre>

<p>More things should be that clear and simple.</p>

It's definitely not clear.  But it is idiomatic, which is more important.  And it's simple, which is also important.  In other words, it's something you can learn to do just once and then apply easily over and over.

<p>Hmph. Perhaps clear<b>ER</b> than it would have been had I not put in the line-breaks for readability and let <tt>&lt;ecode&gt; </tt> cause your browser to scroll off to the right.</p>
