<p>Programming languages in general, and "little" languages in particular,
have always been a love of mine. I've always wanted to eventually work in
compiler and/or language design, though my career has yet to take me down
such paths.</p>
<p>Because of this, I've been eyeing
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/DCONWAY/Parse-RecDescent/"><tt>Parse::RecDescent</tt></a>
for quite a while, waiting for a spare tuit to come along so I could play
with this seemingly-fascinating toy.</p>
<p>As is often the case, it took a day-job work assignment for me to get the
chance. But wow, has it been worth the wait. Not only am I having genuine
<i>fun</i> working on the grammar for this project (which is complex enough
to go into a separate file so that it can be turned into a stand-alone PM
file at build-time), but the more features and tricks I find in the man pages
and examples for <b>P::RD</b>, the more I want to just make up problems to
solve.</p>
<p>Haven't had this much fun programming in quite a while. Also, I'm not sure
which part of that last sentence is the most sad...</p>
</p>

<h2>Fond of P::RD</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2003-05-15T11:25:15</h3>
I also found that, with P::RD.  It kept seeming like a cool tool to solve those odd tasks.  I've used it in a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:stonehenge.com+Parse::RecDescent" title="google.com">few of my columns already</a google.com>.

<p>I actually used the article on <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/col29.html" title="stonehenge.com">safe undumping</a stonehenge.com> as one of my references when getting a handle on it. Very helpful.</p>

<h2>Where to learn?</h2>

What would you say are the best introductory texts you read?

<p>See previous comment, in reply to Randal. Also, use his Google link to see more of his columns. I find that actual, medium to large sized examples are easier to follow than the basic man page.</p>
