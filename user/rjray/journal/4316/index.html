<p>(10:10AM, PDT, Apr 17)
Sitting here in my seat on a flight to Maryland, a woman noticed my OSCON
t-shirt and smiled, giving me a "thumbs-up" for it. I smiled back and
mentioned that I work for an Open Source-supporting company,
<a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a>. She says, "Oh really? My husband
occassionally does some work with them."</p>
<p>I had just been given a "thumbs-up" by the wife of Lawrence
Lessig. Cool.</p>
<p>(10:30AM, PDT) Same journal entry, twenty minutes later (because I draw the
line at using the GTE Airfone to post a journal entry), I now find out that
our in-flight movie is the absolute stinker
<a href="http://www.blackknightmovie">Black Knight</a>. Thank goodness
for laptops.</p>
<p>(6:15PM, EDT)
Layover in Cleveland, en route to Aberdeen, Maryland by way of Reagan National
Airport in Washingtion. Just watched the security steps that are apparently
now standard procedure for all flights into the capitol: they cordon off the
waiting area for the gate in question, make all the waiting passengers leave
temporarily, and proceed to go over the area with microscope and
tweezers. We're talking turning over chairs (including those connected rows
of 5 or more), flashlights, evrything. Throw in a nice vacuuming and you could
right well eat off the floor in that area.</p>
<p>On an unrelated note, I'm a dork. I recently upgraded my laptop's kernel,
but neglected to re-compile the driver for the internal winmodem. Nor do I
have the source handy. So unless I can find someplace in or near Aberdeen that
will let me hook up via my network card, I may not be posting this until my
return. Of all the things to have forgotten...</p>
<p><tt>--rjray</tt></p>
<p><i>Postscript:</i> I got the kernel driver and am now back to where I
should have been before I left yesterday. Whee.</p></p>
