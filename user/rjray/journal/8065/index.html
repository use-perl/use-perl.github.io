<p>I've been getting a fair bit of mileage out of the various notepads
and tablets that I've collected at past OSCONS. Lots of
pencil-and-paper design work, and these pads have been readily at
hand.</p>
<p>But I do think it would be keen if the tablets were narrow-ruled
instead of the usual wide-ruling. I write small, sometimes really
small (depending on how intently I'm concentrating-- the more intent,
the smaller the text). And lately, I've been writing two lines of text
per rules line on the pad, because it's easier than having my notes
appear to be double-spaced.</p>
<p>Just a thought.</p>

<h2>Pencil and paper design work...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jordan/">jordan</a> on 2002-09-28T14:24:13</h3>
I've always liked to do pencil and paper design work.  I am vaguely unsatisfied with it, though.<br> <p>For one, my hand writing is atrocious.  I sometimes can't read what I've written later.  Another is that I've never had a good Engineering Notebook discipline that allows me to save the best stuff for review later.  The scraps always get lost and I inevitably find myself revisiting issues that I'd previously thought about and come to some conclusions about that I have to rediscover.<br> </p><p>I always felt like I'd be more productive if I had good, flexible, easy to use tools for sketching out ideas, annotating them, linking them to other documents, including Web documents and indexing them with keywords.  Anybody using anything like this?  Anybody using anything like this that's easy to use?  I looked at <a href="http://columbus.arup.com/" title="arup.com">Columbus</a arup.com>, but this is AutoCAD oriented.  Maybe I could use the drawing package in Open Office for starters, but I'd need something to help organize.<br> </p><p>Maybe I do too much thinking about design and not enough design, though...</p>
