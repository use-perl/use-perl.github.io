<p><!-- posted by /home/users/rjray/bin/upj_post.pl -->
<p>When I initially wrote the serialization/deserialization code for the
<tt><a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=RPC-XML">RPC::XML</a></tt>
package, it <i>was</i> after all meant to be a reference implementation from
which I wrote extensions to the <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com">XML-RPC</a>
protocol. When that stirred up a storm of shit with
<a href="http://winerlog.inspiredsites.net">Dave Winer</a>, I decide to focus
on code rather than ego, and instead made it a conformant XML-RPC
implementation.</p>
<p>But there was a little trap waiting for me, patiently...</p>
<p>I designed it serialize and deserialize in memory. Even as I wrote support
for the Base-64 datatype and wrote tests to validate it, I didn't think about
how <b>big</b> something sent as a Base-64 chunk would likely be.</p>
<p>A project I'm working on at the <a href="http://www.tellme.com">day job</a>
will be using the package to move Base-64-encoded WAV files. That's pretty
damned big. And suddenly, keeping it all in memory is a <i>really bad idea</i>.
So I'm spending my weekend coming up with a streaming layer for serialization
and deserialization in the package. 'Cause I'm going to need it on Monday when
I get back into the office.</p>

<h2>Big data scares me</h2>

When I was thinking about the successor to the XML-RPC, this was one subject I wanted to cover. I think you can either chunk the data over several messages (which the client has to know to assemble) or you simply give a URL pointer to the data, which can be downloaded over vanilla HTTP. Both of these solutions are, I admit, hella lame.

<p>The specific case that's driving this development suffers from more design woes than just this. But at present, I have to be prepared to fetch WAV data that was sent as an e-mail attachment (!) over an XML-RPC interface.</p>
<p>And it <i>has</i> occurred to me that even as I do all this work this weekend, I have no idea if their server (for which the XML-RPC component is very new and highly experimental) can even deal with that much data in a single message. They, too, may suffer from having code that expects to read all of a base64 object into memory before encoding it and sending it across the socket.</p>

This is where xlink would be very appropriate, and where Dave Winer needs to get off his high horse about namespaces - they would be very useful here.
