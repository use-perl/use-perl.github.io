<div class="span8">
<p><p>I've just uploaded the second "real" release of WebService-ISBNDB, version
0.20, to CPAN. I don't have the auto-post-to-use.perl.org thing working that
I used to, because I don't use fetchmail anymore (I leave stuff on my IMAP
store or save it to a Thunderbird folder). That means I never announced the
first release, or the two previous releases that were named Net-ISBNDB. I
changed the name after Adam Kennedy made a good argument for the
<tt>WebService::</tt> prefix.</p>
<p>This package is an object-oriented layer over the actual published API of
<a href="http://isbndb.com">isbndb.com</a>. It presents all five elements
(authors, books, categories, publishers and subjects) as classes. Elements
that reference other elements (such as the authors, subjects and publisher of
a book) are lazy-loaded when first requested through the accessor methods.
You'll have to have an API key from them, which is free once you've registered.
The catch is that the key is generally good for 500 requests per day, which
most of you probably won't find to be an issue. It <i>did</i> become an
issue for me, though, when writing the test suite that this release
introduces (the first release had some basic tests, but no actual data tests).
I quickly ran up 500 requests in less than two hours the other day. As part
of addressing this problem, I checked and found that my suite of tests was
making 58 requests per complete run. I had created a key that I was going to
use for CPAN build/install runs, but it was clear that the key wouldn't work
very well; more than eight people installing in a given 24-hour period would
tap it out.</p>
<p>Solving the problem actually proved the robustness of the base communication
class, <tt><a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/RJRAY/WebService-ISBNDB-0.12/lib/WebService/ISBNDB/Agent.pm">WebService::ISBNDB::Agent</a></tt>
(points to the version from the previous release). I was able to create a
dummy adapter, overload just one method, and BAM! it would read the XML from
local files in the test-suite directory. Even better, I was able to make a
run of the suites that actually read from the service, and save all the
requests to files, by having the dummy adapter go ahead and call the
super-class method and write the data to the filename it would have otherwise
read. I then restored the method to the read-data approach, and my hits on
the service dropped from 58 to 0.</p>
<p>This was also my first foray into using
<tt><a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/dconway/Class-Std/">Class::Std</a></tt>.
As someone who worries (too much) about people sub-classing my classes and
stepping on my keys, this is an interesting approach. I had some weird issues
to work around, though. The framework is meant for you to not have to (ever)
write your own <tt>new()</tt>. So if you do, you have the issues. I had
assumed that I could just use <tt>Class::Std</tt> as my class' base, and it
works, but it doesn't seem to be intended for that purpose, at least not on
the surface. And in my case, I wanted to provide some syntactic sugar for
object creation (i.e., if you are instantiating an object from a known-to-be
unique value, you should be able to do so with minimal typing; something like
"<tt>$book = WebService::ISBNDB::API::Books->new($isbn)</tt>"). To make the
sugar work, I had to allow <tt>new()</tt> to take something other than a
single hash-ref. And to do that, I had to provide my own. When I did, I got
warnings about redefining it, since <tt>Class::Std</tt> generates one when
you use it. I'm not sure how I'd recommend getting around this... I suppose
<tt>Class::Std</tt> could check that you both have an existing <tt>new()</tt>
<b>and</b> have <tt>Class::Std</tt> in your inheritance hierarchy.</p>
<p>The other issue I had to struggle with is that I'm currently very busy
with paying work right now. And every hour I squirreled away for this felt
like I was stealing it from "more important" work. The amount of change this
release delivers kind of defies the ten days or so since the last release. I
<i>could</i> have done all of this in a day (maybe two if it was the weekend
and I had other distractions). But I've been sick all of this past week, and
I've felt kind of bad each time I worked on this instead of the other.
Obviously not <i>too</i> bad, I guess, or I wouldn't be releasing a new version.</p>
<p>This is also the first NEW module I've come up with in what feels like
ages, so I'm pretty happy with myself to have broken out of my rut. Now if
you don't mind, I have some more hacking (of the phlegmy-lung-variety) and
wheezing to attend to.</p>
