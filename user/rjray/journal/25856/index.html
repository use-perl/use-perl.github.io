<p>I'm restless.</p>
<p>I'm restless in three distinct areas of my life. Fortunately, I have three
distinct blogs, each covering (more or less) one of those three aspects. So
I'm making three entries at (roughly) the same time.</p>
<p>I'm restless in my profession. I feel almost like I have to go in a drastically-different professional
direction, in order to keep any sense of freshness, of learning new things, a
regular part of what I do. I don't mean a change of professions-- programming
always has been, and surely always will be my passion.</p>
<p>But I seem to have found myself in a place where the things I do are
difficult, are complex, but are not terribly challenging. Part of the problem
seems to be Perl itself. Not in shortcomings of the language (per se), but in
the fact that the number of places that treat it like a serious, large-scale-software-development
language are few and far between. It's almost like the "fast" girl back in
high school: it's fun to take out for scripts and even the occassional
web-commerce app, but you don't want to be caught writing a full-on IDE like
Eclipse in it.</p>
<p>Maybe Perl 6 will inject some life into it for me. Now, I know there are
still a lot of Perl hackers out there who are way ahead of me. But I've never
had any interest in obfuscated Perl, or in trying to find the most
fiendishly-clever way to do something. I've been content to write clean,
readable code that people find easy to use, and I find easy to maintain. It's
no surprise that the majority of the open source software I've crafted has
taken the form of tools for use by developers. They're generally more
appreciative of factors like reliability, maintainability and clarity. More so
than the average user, at least. I think there is still a great landscape of
good software waiting to be written in Perl. But I'm not going to get to any
of it on my current path.</p>
<p>Whether because of emotional fatigue over the job, or physical fatigue from
external sources, I don't get as much time to spend on my OSS projects as I
would like. It's probably a combination of the two, but the fact still stands.
I'm such a geek, that my fantasy for if I should ever win the lottery involves
buying a good home, setting up the rest of the money in funds and investments,
then living off of the returns and interest for the rest of my life, writing
code for any OSS project that tickles my fancy. I'd love to be contributing to
either Perl 6 or Parrot, without having to choose between it and the few
hobbies of my own that I try to foster.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, I've never really had a job that put me in a place
to work towards my true passion: language design and compilers. While at
Red Hat, I tried to convince them to let me contribute to Perl 6 in a way
similar to how they contribute to other non-kernel OSS projects. They have
people who do little more than hack on GTK+, GNOME, RPM, etc. It didn't work
out, which is just as well as I was pink-slipped within a year or so of that
proposal. I find areas like Aspect-Oriented Programming very interesting, and
I'd love to have more time to learn about virtual machine programming theory,
in particular the Parrot VM and the .NET CLR. Very, very few people are
lucky-enough to be able to get paid to do these things. And for these sorts of
endeavors, I'd be practically an entry-level candidate. I'd have the years of
general experience, but not any practical, or directly relevant experience</p>
<p>Other languages are starting to lure me away, with promises of having a
different class of problems to solve. I've recently been re-learning Lisp. I've
been on Java for quite a while now. It truly is like programming in a
straightjacket, but there's some comfort to be had in that if you look at it
right. And <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> is just a dead-sexy
environment to work in. There's a prototyping of Perl 6 being done in Haskell,
and when I was sharing office space with the ex-Cygnus folks who'd been
acquired by Red Hat, they often sang the praises of Standard ML. I even long
to write C again, or at least settle for C++. Then there's writing: I want to
write more. I have two book ideas, and a handful of article ideas. Again, like
the OSS projects that lay gathering dust, I seem to lack the time to spend on
them.</p>
<p>Something will have to change in the near future, I just don't know
what or how. And the not-knowing is contributing mightily to the sense of
restlessness.</p>
