<p><p>Work on <b>THE BOOK</b> is progressing, but it is progressing far more slowly than I would like it to. And a good part of the blame for that must rest on my shoulders, upon which also rests an easily-distracted head.</p>
<p>Last night, for example, I wrote 3 1/2 pages, including a fairly thorough examples, a clean bulleted-list of explanation covering the example, and a pithy remark in a footnote to one of the bullet items. And I did this in about an hour or so. With grammar-checking and slight editing. Most people would be quite happy about that. So would I, had it not been <i>3-freakin'-A-M</i> at the time. I <i>had</i> been sitting with the laptop for quite a while at that point. Mostly re-reading the parts I've written, the (thankfully finished) first chapter, etc. I had moved away from the room with the TV, and even away from the main desk of computers (and internet access point, since I don't have a wireless point in my apartment [yet]). So the lack of focus is not directly curable simply by the absence of distractions.</p>
<p>On the plus side, it is in fact moving more quickly with each passing day. I had just hoped to be further than I currently am, by this point in time. Between the recent passing of a friend, and a recent spate of emergency fixit-tasks at the day-job, the past three to four weeks have snuck past me.</p>
