<p><!-- posted by /home/users/rjray/bin/upj_post.pl -->
<p>At long last, I have 802.11b working on my Red Hat-powered laptop. It took
two different access points (the first was likely faulty, since it just never
sent any DHCP traffic, not even its own) and three tries with
cards. Ironically, the first card I tried was the D-Link DWL-650, which I
replaced with a SMS 2632W only to replace that with a new D-Link after getting
a working WAP. The card works (I had to adjust the wlan configuration to use
the <tt>orinoco_cs</tt> driver instead of the <tt>prism2_cs</tt> driver, as
the latter was generating "unresolved symbol" errors from the kernel module
loader).</p>
<p>Anyway, the combination of stock <tt>kernel</tt> and
<tt>kernel-pcmcia-cs</tt> packages, combined with the latest <a
href="http://www.linux-wlan.com">linux-wlan-ng</a> software package (note that
the "ng" package is needed for 11Mbs support) did the trick. Thanks to them, I
have a working wireless set up at last.</p>
<p>And that is why I am able to write the entry from a seated position in my
bathroom.</p>

<h2>TiBook</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-06-09T02:18:24</h3>
As has been reported elsewhere, the TiBook built-in wireless range *sucks*, because it is intefered with by the Titanium (duh).  I periodically try to rearrange my base station to get better reception, and the most important areas are, in order, 1. my office desk, 2. the TV room, 3. the downstairs bathroom, 4. the upstairs bathroom.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  The bedroom, kitchen table, and deck come next, and all have poor reception.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(

<p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>/me wonders the euphamism will change from the `reading room' to the `surfing room'.
</p>
<p>
Not that I've ever personally irc'd while using the facilities.  Nope.  Never.

<p>It does make me wonder if I have the "honor" of being the first person on use.perl to actually <i>post</i> an entry while using the bathroom...</p>

Or just the first to publically announce it.
