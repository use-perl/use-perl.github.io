<p><!-- posted by /home/users/rjray/bin/upj_post.pl -->
<p>There are still a few lingering blog entries to write, but the show is
now winding down. I'm in the closing session, in which they've announced the
winners of the <a href="http://photos.linux.hp.com/">HP-sponsored OSCON
Photo Competition</a> and gnat has given recognition to the key O'Reilly
staff who've made the conference run so smoothly. He also distributed some
left-over swag. Generally by throwing it over the seated crowd.</p>
<p>The closing talk is Miguel de Icaza, talking about the efforts made at
Novell to move ~5500 employees to completely-Linux destops. This involves
replacing apps where they can, and writing new ones where they have to. The
new apps they develop are all built on the
<a href="http://www.go-mono.com">Mono</a> platform, in C#.</p>
<p>Desktop issues have come up a lot this year at OSCON. There's some
"enterprise" work, applications that go beyond the basic things we (currently)
expect from a desktop environment. He's talking about something they call
"iFolder", which handles smooth synchronization of file-trees between systems
that are only occassionally connected. Now he's talking about "Beagle", a
search appliance similar what Google and Yahoo! are doing, using Lucene.NET
and other elements.</p>
<p>He's also touching on how the progress of the desktop has been hampered by
the lack of a really-good rendering library, until
<a href="http://cairographics.org/">Cairo</a> came along. He's also referring
to a new implementation of an X server <i>on top of OpenGL</i>. Not X trying
to support GL, X11 <b>in</b> it. Combined with Cairo, there's a potential for
amazing stuff. Right now, he's demo'ing it: true transparency in windows,
3-D zooming of the desktop, switching virtual desktops by grabbing the bottom
edge and <i>flipping</i> it around. He just started a video player, moved it
half-way off the edge, then started a flip: the video was wrapper around the
edge of the "cube". OpenGL effects are applied at pretty much al levels;
moving windows or icons, etc. GNOME 2.12 will feature some or all of this,
it wasn't clear how much would be deployed with that release (slated for
October). Really stunning, though admittedly it falls more in the "eye-candy"
camp.</p>
<p>It's been a heck of a week. I still have more thoughts to sift into words,
so be sure and check back.</p></p>
