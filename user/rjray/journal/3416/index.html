<div class="span8">
<p><p>Friday night, my laptop ("<tt>gangrel</tt>") refused to come back on from a suspend. It's in a shop, now, in the hands of people who weren't even fazed when I explained that yes, it was a dual-boot system that defaults to Red Hat Linux. I'm certain that it's a hardware issue, not a kernel issue, since I removed the battery and the power cable, to ensure that the system went completely zero-power. So I'm equally certain that all my data will survive the ordeal. In the meantime, I can no longer take my work with me to a nice caf&eacute;, away from the distractions of my apartment.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I was in the habit of making semi-regular backups of the data to my desktop (nothing fancy, just <tt>rsync</tt>). So I spent most of yesterday downloading and installing StarOffice on my Windoze "game" machine, <tt>malkavian</tt>. My desktop Linux system ("<tt>tremere</tt>") is what I use for almost everything at home (e-mail, coding, builds for CPAN release, etc.), but as a 233MHz Pentium I, the CPU graph flickers just from typing text in XEmacs. I shudder to think what StarOffice 5.2 would do to it. Anyway, I've been neglecting the Windoze box as I focus on writing, so this will let me continue to work (if the laptop takes more than a day or two) while keeping <tt>malkavian</tt> from feeling unloved.</p>
<p>I've also considered taking this as a <b>Grand Cosmic Hint</b> that maybe I'm working too hard, and should instead take the day or three this offers and either do some work on my hobby (painting miniatures), or do a MakeMaker-writeup that I've been toying around with over on <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org">perlmonks.org</a>. The part that really bites is being bound to the desktop, again. I'd grown very fond of the freedom that the new (well, new since November) laptop gave me.</p>
<p>And I'm none too happy at the thought of a repair bill, either. Dell isn't too interested in helping me, because I bought the machine (albeit new) from a third party.</p>
