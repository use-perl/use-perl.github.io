<p>This was originally a much longer, much more biting screed. For whatever reason, I couldn't sleep after writing it, and I've decided to remove the majority of it. Sorry, but that's just what I feel is best. These days, I can never be sure who will Google me and find something worth denying me a job over.</p>
<p>I am no longer an employee of Red Hat, Inc.</p>
<p>I didn't work alone in web engineering at
Red Hat-- I'd always been a part of a team, and the others in my team who
remain, I wish the best for. They're good engineers, as well as good
programmers.</p>
<p>I don't hate Red Hat. I was running RH Linux on my boxes before I worked
there, and I'll continue to do so (at least until/unless I get a job for which
I need a different type of testing platform available to me). I intend to
continue writing the Perl-RPM bindings I've been working on. And best of all,
I now have time to work with more dedication on my book. So there is a silver
lining of sorts here, I guess.</p>

Losing a job sucks.  I hope you find a new job soon.  Best of luck to you.
