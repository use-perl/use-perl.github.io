<p>(This entry is both another test and a legit entry. You <i>can</i>
sometimes have it both ways, after all.)</p>

<p>I watch very little television these days. I have a sizable cable-TV bill,
mind you, because a lot of what I <i>do</i> watch is at least on basic cable
programming, if not on a premium station. I'll confess to watching
<u>Farscape</u> (SciFi), <u>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</u> and <u>Enterprise</u>
(both UPN), <u>Sopranos</u> and <u>Six Feet Under</u> (both HBO), and a
handful of others. I calculated once that at a worst-case point in overlapping
seasons (since many of the shows have shorter seasons than you usual network
fare), I might have 12 hours a week that I set aside for
watching. Realistically, I only average 6-8 hours, because many of the HBO
shows rarely overlap their seasons, and even the network shows fall back to
re-runs for more than half of the year.</p>

<p>So when I do watch something, I suppose I'm more vulnerable to being
repulsed by the sad state of advertising. I say vulnerable, because I feel
that if I watched TV more than I currently do, I'd have developed a tolerance,
a resistance to it. As it is, my brain has to rapidly deploy anti-moronic
antibodies before I give in to the impulse to buy a new car, consume cheap
beer, and utilize hair-restoration products that are potentially toxic to the
touch. (Think I'm kidding on that last one? Listen to the quickly-spewed
disclaimers at the end of a commercial for Propecia.) How can a
hair-regeneration drug be so critical to society, that it would be made
available even if it's a potential hazard to women who might even be
<b>thinking</b> about getting pregnant? Besides, my hair is
<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=143330">this close to
non-existent</a> on purpose, anyway.</p>

<p>It's not merely limited to television, it's just more prevalent there. On a
recent drive home from work, I was alternately amused and annoyed by an ad for
a product being sold via web-presense at "penisgrowth.com" And yes, I
consciously choose not to make that an actual link. Type it into your
browser's location box if you want to, but I won't be responsible for them
getting any referrer logs on <i>their</i> site from <i>this</i> one. I was
amazed at how many times the (female, of course) narrator managed to fit the
phrase, "penis-growth-dot-com" into a single 30-second ad spot. I can only
guess as to how long she was laughing, once the recording was completed and
the mics turned off.</p>

<p>I long for a TiVo, but even if I were ready to make the investment (and go
through the trouble of switching signal providers), it would only simplify the
process of skipping over the crud. It wouldn't eliminate it. <b><i>I</i></b>
would still know it was there. It just gets so discouraging, sometimes.</p>

<p>Must run to the grocery-- I have a sudden craving for a rather specific
brand of snack food...</p>

<h2>Now for the Perl-relevancy...</h2>

<p>It was posted not only by means of my upj_post.pl script (written as an exercise while learning <a href="http://www.soaplite.com/" title="soaplite.com">SOAP::Lite</a soaplite.com>), it was posted <i>from</i> within a buffer in XEmacs. I still have a few quirks on the XEmacs side to fix (it initially had comments disabled, I'd like the function to use the whole buffer if a region isn't already selected, etc.), but this beats the heck out of creating a temp file for every journal entry, just to avoid using the browser interface.</p>
