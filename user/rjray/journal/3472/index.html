<p><p>If this works correctly, then I will have added a new journal entry
remotely, using the SOAP interface that pudge
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/3294">recently installed</a>.</p>
<p>To me, what will make this significant is that it's a small step from
this (admittedly simple) Perl script to integrating this sort of posting
ability into native HTML tools, more text-oriented editors such as vi or
emacs, you get the picture. All the while, the basic underlying nature of
the use.perl.org log is still intact: the rest of you kind folks out there in
reader-land still make use of the web idiom to view this, or perhaps some
future retrieval method geared towards AvantGo! or RSS or whatever. The are
no limitations on either side of this arrangement, except those for which
we've written solutions for.</p>
<p>And on that note, I believe I'll be about writing my next SOAP app...</p>

<p><i>Postscript</i><br><br>
This didn't initially work, but it wasn't due to the application, it was due
to the fact that the application relied on my Netscape cookie-file for the
authentication tokens, and I had my user configuration set for session cookies
rather than persistent ones. I'll eventually incorporate pudge's
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/3459">more-recent post</a> on using
the SOAP interface without a Netscape cookie file.</p>
