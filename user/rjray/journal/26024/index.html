<p><!-- posted by /home/users/rjray/bin/upj_post.pl -->
<p>D. Richard Hipp, the creator of <a href="http://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a>,
knows his stuff. This isn't exactly news, as anyone who's used SQLite knows
this. The tool is well-designed and well-written. What's more, it's also
pretty well-documented, something that OS projects can't always claim.</p>
<p>He also gives a good tutorial. He's not as hyper as Damian, but he's
engaging and he uses a lot of very applicable, easily-understood examples as
he goes along. I don't know that what I'm learning here is going to make my
usage of SQLite that much more efficient, but I'll certainly have a better
understanding of what is going on under the hood as I code. And some elements
may actually lead to better performance in apps using SQLite. Great contrast
from the first tutorial of the day.</p>
<p>Unfortunately (for me), one of my book ideas was to write about this topic,
and apparently someone is already working on one. I hope to chat and see what
his plans are, especially where coverage of language bindings are concerned.
Who knows, he might be interested in having someone contribute...</p></p>
