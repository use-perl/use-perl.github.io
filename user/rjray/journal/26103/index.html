<p>The talk is done. Alas, I ran over and had to rush my last 4-5 slides.
Part of the problem was that there was a slight 'net hiccup that detached the
machine in the presentation room from the share that held all the slides. I
lost about 5 minutes while we fixed that. Then, there were more questions at
places I hadn't expected; good questions that deserved good answers, so it
wouldn't have been fair to dismiss them. Still, what matters the most: one
person stopped me on the way out, saying that he had been faced with exactly
that sort of problem (justifying a choice of SOAP over REST), and I had given
him the words he needed to explain to the people that mattered. No doubt, it
really makes you feel good to know that someone actually benefits from your
efforts.</p>
<p>I forget, sometimes, how much I enjoy doing this. It's funny, since I'm not
that social of a person. But I do like sharing knowledge as much and as often
as I can.</p>
<p>Should probably start working on next year's proposals sooner, as opposed
to later.</p></p>
