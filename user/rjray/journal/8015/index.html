<p><!-- posted by /home/users/rjray/bin/upj_post.pl -->
<p>I have a new favorite web-site/blog. This came to me by way of
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/gnat/">gnat</a>, who apparently got it
from <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/">pudge</a>. But neither of them
have posted to <i>their</i> journals about it, yet, so I get to do so
first.</p>
<p>Behold the wonder and beauty that is
<a href="http://winerlog.inspiredsites.net/">Winerlog</a>. Have <i>you</i>
been subjected to venom and vitriol from Dave Winer? Have you been called at
home or at work, with demands that you cease working on some project or other?
Or do you just need a good laugh at the expense of someone who brings this
sort of disdain and derision upon himself, with no one else to blame for his
questionable reputation? Well, if you answered yes to any of those (and let's
be honest here, that last one was a gimme-- who <i>doesn't</i> need a good
laugh, especially at someone else's self-inflicted expense?) then you should
quickly click over to <a href="http://winerlog.inspiredsites.net/">Winerlog</a>
and have a read.</p>
<p>What, you're still here? You haven't clicked yet?</p>

<blockquote><em>The problem with defending the purity of the English
language is that English is about as pure as a cribhouse whore. We
don't just borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other
languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their
pockets for new vocabulary.</em></blockquote>
