<p>While I should concentrate on my job and on <a href="http://www.yapc.org/Europe/">YAPC::Europe</a>, the political campaigning has reach its height.
Each corner, each lightpole has a poster of some party and it's candidates. You see them on TV in the most unlikely combinations (eg. conservatives with trade union members) and all kinds of small parties you will not hear again from until the next election, when they will crop up again.
Due to the 5 % watershed (only parties reaching that much in an election can be in parliament), there are no more than 4 to 6 parties in parliament although there are 24 standing for election.<br><br>
Yes, I will go to the election<br>
Yes, I will vote for one of the 6 parties that have a chance to go to parliament. Everything else would just mean throwing ones vote away.<br><br>
Still this whole business looks a bit useless to me ... political change might make some things different - but not necessarily better</p>

That's just ensures things don't change.<br> </p><p>Think about it.  Do you really want everything to be totally controlled by those who pick the candidates for the 'popular' parties.  A vote for a minority party may not make a difference in this election, but it could help to establish those parties and candidates for the future.<br> </p><p>

While this is true and has brought us the green party to parliament, many of those parties have a very limited point of view. Some far right, one or two far left parties, a party for the elderly, a feminist party, a few environmentalist parties and so on. For the last election there even was a "car drivers party". <br> <br>And none of those cover all the things I think of, when I think about politics.<br> <br>
Each time I go to an election, casting a vote seems harder.

But, "throwing the vote away" is a bad reason not to vote for someone, IMO.</p>
