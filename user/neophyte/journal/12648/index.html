<p>Midday, yesterday former vice chancellor Juergen W. Moellemann died while skydiving.
It is unclear, and will possibly remain so, whether it was suicide or not.
His death has stopped all investigations on financing both his party and a leaflet that was highly critical on Israel that was published during the election campaing. A dead man can't be sued. <br>
His opinions always were a very controversial matter (which also lead his party to bar him recently), and althouth I never liked him much, I hate to see Germany lose a politician that dared raising controversial discussions.
It will remain in the dark whether he really was more corrupt than other politicians - and I dare say I doubt it. <br>
My sympathy goes to his family.</p>

<p>A death is always sad, whether the man be good or evil.</p>
