<p>To be honest, I really think a part of all this isn't FUD.</p><p>Perl 6 is being talked about... inside the Perl community. You don't see articles by random people not involved in its development somehow.</p><p>As some of the comments state, I honestly  think Perl 6 should really change its name to something like Perl++ or PerlNG (next-generation) and free up the name for regular Perl.</p><p>I'd rather see a Perl 6 which is basically Perl 5.12 but with some heavy optimizations done to add support for a built-in Moose-like syntax.</p><p>I guess this would be good marketing for both projects. And we would be able to sort of have an analogy between C/C++ and Perl/Perl++ (or NG).</p><p>Perl++ would have much cooler stuff than Perl, in the same way C++ has much cooler stuff than C. However, both languages are clearly distinct and both have their own places.</p><p>It doesn't matter how much we tell outsiders that Perl 5 is one language and Perl 6 is another: the sequential thought is too strong (specially when you have Java marketing which calls version 1.6 as Java 6, 1.5 as Java 5, and so on).</p>

<p>Oh well, maybe I should have phrased that as "in the same way C++ has more modern features than C".</p><p>But I believe you were still able to understand my point.</p>

<p>Yes I did. What I&#8217;m saying is that marketing-wise, you probably want to stay far away from making C&#160;&#8596;&#160;C++ parallels&#8230; &#8220;Modern&#8221; doesn&#8217;t cut it either, <a href="http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/" title="yosefk.com">clueful people consider C++ an abomination</a yosefk.com>. You don&#8217;t want to go anywhere near that.</p>
