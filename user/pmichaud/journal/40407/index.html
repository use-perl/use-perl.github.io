<h1>Rakudo Star (a &quot;usable Perl 6&quot;) to be released by July 29</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/pmichaud/">pmichaud</a> on 2010-06-19T17:04:21</h2>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>As many of you know, last summer we announced that we would be releasing
a "<a href='http://use.perl.org/user/pmichaud/journal/39411'>usable release of Rakudo Perl 6</a>" to be called "Rakudo Star" in the 
second quarter of 2010.  We later refined our target release date to
be April 2010.</p>

<p>Until March of this year we were well on track to meet the April
2010 release date, but then I had an 
<a href='http://use.perl.org/user/pmichaud/journal/40248'>family 
medical emergency</a>
that took me away from Perl 6 development.  As a result of my situation,
the Rakudo and Perl 6 team met online in early March and decided that 
an April release date would be unrealistic, and we instead 
focused our efforts on trying to make a June release for Rakudo
Star, to keep with our original "second quarter 2010" goal.</p>

<p>Ultimately it ended up being twelve weeks before I was able to return
to active Perl 6 development (i.e., late May).  During my absence the
others on the Rakudo and Perl 6 team made incredible progress on
Rakudo Perl 6; I think their progress shows that a truly capable (and
growing) team of developers has coalesced around Rakudo Perl.  Thanks 
to their efforts, as of late May the compiler had nearly everything 
we identified as critical for Rakudo Star in the ROADMAP, with only a 
few key features blocking on my personal participation.  We therefore 
felt we still had a good likelihood of meeting the June 2010 target, 
and continued to work with that goal in mind.</p>

<p>As part of planning this week's Parrot and Rakudo releases,
we all met online to solidify our plans for the Rakudo Star release.  
After much discussion, we decided that although we could likely make some
sort of Rakudo Star release in June, there was too much risk that
releasing in June would fall well short of our vision of what
we want Rakudo Star to be.</p>

<p>Therefore, we've decided to to let the release date slip one more
month and release Rakudo Star not later than July 29, 2010.
We are firmly committed to the July 29 date; whatever we have 
available then, that's what we release.  I know that another delay 
will be frustrating to many (it is very frustrating to me), 
and that some will undoubtedly cite this delay as yet more "evidence"
that there will never be a release of Perl 6.  But given the 
circumstances, I think we feel that we promote Perl 6 better by
moving the release date by a month than we would by releasing 
something less than our vision.

<p>For those who might claim that we should "release early", we 
<i>are</i> still continuing to make regular monthly compiler releases.  
The most recent release 
(<a href='http://rakudo.org/node/72'>#30, "Kiev"</a>) 
comes with a lot of improvements
over previous releases, and I truly expect the next release 
(#31, "Atlanta") to continue the trend.  As always, we continue to 
invite people to try out the compiler releases and to visit the 
<a href='http://perl6.org/'>Perl 6 website</a> to see what 
Perl 6 is already doing today.</p>

<p>Finally, on a personal note, my wife and I sincerely appreciate
the ongoing support, prayers, and understanding we have received from 
the Perl community (and especially the Rakudo and Perl 6 teams) during 
these difficult times.  While my wife is still not "out of the woods" yet,
things are far better now than they were in the Spring, and we 
continue to work towards and pray for her full recovery.</p>

<p>More details about the Rakudo Star release will be forthcoming
over the next couple of weeks.</p>

<h2>It's OK</h2>

<p>I'm sure most perlers understand the situation. Three month from the _very_ aggressive deadline, and one from the more relaxed is not that bad, given the circumstances.</p><p>I expect the release to be slow but somehow functional. I hope it will be possible to play with PostgreSQL in some way.</p><p>Keep up the good work!</p>

<p>You can even now play with fakedbi, see <a href="http://github.com/mberends/fakedbi/" title="github.com">http://github.com/mberends/fakedbi/</a github.com></p><p>I know it supports mysql, and since parrot has postgresql bindings, I think it shouldn't be too hard to add a postgres backend.</p><p>If you do it yourself, you can actually make *sure* that Rakudo Star ships with postgres support<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<h2>Delays</h2>

The primary criticism Perl6 gets is that it is "taking forever to release", hopefully Rakudo * will turn things in the right direction



<h2>never mind, play family first.</h2>

The jobs you've done recently is two times more rewarding. Keep on going on and many thanks for your investment in the community.
