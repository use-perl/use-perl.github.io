<div class="span8">
<p>[Reposted from <URL: http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=836349>.  Normally I wouldn't repost but I'd like it to appear in my normal Perl 6 journal and rss feeds as well as on PerlMonks.  --Pm]

<p>An Anonymous Monk on perlmonks.org recently started a discussion on
"<a href='http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=835419'>The current state of Perl 6</a>" in which he (she? they?) offers his
views on various aspects of Perl 6 development.  Personally, I 
find nearly all of Anonymous Monk's comments in the thread to be
so devoid of logic and so far removed from reality/facts that it's
hard to imagine providing an adequate reply to them.</p>

<p>Beyond that, I have other priorities in my life right now.
Uppermost is that my family is going through a very difficult
period at present -- I need to take care of them first.  Rakudo and
Perl 6 come in at a somewhat distant second to that.  Responding to
garbage being spouted by anonymous person(s) probably ought
to not even be anywhere on my radar.</p>

<p>But at least one post in the thread bugs me sufficiently that 
I'd like to respond, even if it's an inadequate response.
And I don't want my response buried in a thread somewhere, so it
gets its own post.</p>

<p>Anonymous Monk <a href='http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=835737'>writes</a>:</p>

<blockquote><em>
Oh I'll tell you how you do that &#91;write a grammar engine capable 
of supporting Perl 6]. It's very simple. You get people skilled 
for this exact task ! Those skills are acquired in 
universities(preferably good ones) where professors teach 
courses like "Formal Languages and Automata" or "Compiler 
theory". If you have a bunch of people who are open-source 
contributors but don't have the knowledge or haven't studied 
the right things ... <strong>&#91;t]hey don't know it in theory 
and they're trying to put it in practice! 
</strong></em> (emphasis in original)</blockquote>

<p>Who does Anonymous Monk think is working on Perl 6?  Personally, I
have a Ph.D. in Computer Science and taught university language 
courses for nearly 14 years.  Damian Conway certainly also
has a fairly strong university background (Monash University) and 
understands the theory and practice of language and compiler design.  
Jonathan Worthington has a degree from the University of Cambridge, 
where he specialized in compiler construction and formal languages.  
Larry Wall has a degree in Natural and Artificial Languages 
with two years of graduate work in Linguistics at U.C. Berkeley.  
Many of our other key contributors also have degrees and backgrounds 
in language theory and practice.  I'd be willing to compare the
academic credentials of this group against any other dynamic 
language team Anonymous Monk might care to postulate.</p>

<blockquote><em>If you can't get <strong>real</strong> compiler people
to use Perl6 and help with it, the average open-source rookie
won't be able to deal with this.</em></blockquote>

<p>Somehow I have trouble classifying Larry, Damian, Allison, etc. as
being "not real compiler people".  And they along with many other
Perl 6 contributors have a lot of experience in nurturing open
source developers and projects.  If you feel Larry et al. are 
indeed unqualified to be working in the field of programming
language design and implementation, you probably don't want to 
be using Perl at all, much less Perl 6.</p>

<p>People like Anonymous Monk spew lots of opinions about how long
they think Perl 6 development should take, and then speculate on
the reasons why it has taken longer than they estimate it should
be taking.  The speculations that crop up most often are things
like "the people involved are clueless about language
design/implementation" (see above), "the design process itself
is flawed", "they're building on an inadequate toolset like Parrot",
etc.  For such people it's easy to toss out random thoughts about
"the problems with Perl 6" without bothering to look at
the obvious evidence to the contrary, as Anonymous Monk
does above.  Indeed, I'm often amused when people suggest that
we should be doing things
<em><a href='http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=43556&cid=70194'>that we're already doing</a></em>.</p>

<p>Returning to the topic of developing a grammar engine, which
Anonymous Monk claims above as "very simple" and just needing
"people skilled for this exact task", it's interesting to contrast
his opinions with the actual development of the Perl 6 standard grammar
(<a href='http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/src/perl6/STD.pm6'>STD.pm6</a>).
I think STD.pm6 is also indicative of the challenges confronting all
Perl 6 implementors.  Consider:

<ul><li>Larry is the primary implementor for the standard grammar.</li>
<li> The standard grammar doesn't need a frozen specification
  to be implemented, because its implementation is considered
  part of the spec.</li>
<li>The implementation is built entirely on top of Perl 5 -- there
  are no "unproven virtual machines" involved or holding things
  back.</li></ul></p>

<p>I think one could consider this to be an almost perfect situation
for developing a new language implementation -- an experienced language
designer/implementor working without significant external
restrictions on top of an advanced programming platform like
Perl 5.  Yet it's been three years since Larry started working
on this implementation of the standard grammar and parser, and
while STD.pm6 is very powerful, it's also certainly not "finished",
and has been through a number of significant refactors in its
development.  This says to me that the amount of time and effort
involved is more likely due to the sheer audacity and ambition of what
Perl 6 seeks to accomplish.</p>

<p>(Some will undoubtedly look at the above and knee-jerk respond
with something like "If it's taken three years just to create
the parser, then finishing a compiler will take far longer still
and therefore Perl 6 will never see the light of day."
This argument ignores the fact that other pieces
are being implemented in parallel with Larry's work, that
software development is not a strictly sequential process, and
the obvious fact that there are already "working" Perl 6
implementations available.)</p>

<p>Anyone who thinks that Perl 6 is fundamentally based on
traditional compiler construction techniques taught in
universities frankly has no clue as to what a fundamental
paradigm shift Perl 6 represents to language design and
implementation.  It's this fundamental change that ultimately
gives Perl 6 its power, but it's also why Perl 6 development
is not a trivial exercise that can be done by a few
dedicated undergraduates.  As
<a href='http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2010-04-22#i_2253574'>TimToady on #perl6 says</a>,
"We already have lots of those kinds of languages." </p>

<p>Personally, I'm impressed and honored to be associated with
the people who are working on Rakudo and Perl 6.  I understand
that people are frustrated (and even feel burned by) the long
wait for something as cool as Perl 6; I share the frustration
and like to think that I'm doing something constructive about it.
But I also find the vast majority of suggestions, comments, and 
conclusions coming from Perl 6's anonymous detractors to be
(1) things we've already done or are doing, (2) ungrounded in
reality, (3) in direct contradiction to reasonably observable 
facts, or (4) attempts to discredit a product they have little
interest in ever using themselves.  And far too many of the
comments, like the ones I've highlighted in this post, are
so easily refuted with just a little bit of fact digging and
common sense, it's often hard to believe anyone can be seriously
making them in the first place.  Yet there they are.</p>

<p>Returning to my original theme, I think my response here is
inadequate because it leaves so many other of Anonymous Monk's
claims in the thread unrefuted.  I could undoubtedly spend many
more hours analyzing and responding to the many fallacies and untruths
in the thread, but frankly I don't believe that's the best use of
my time.  People such as Moritz Lenz, chromatic, Michael Schwern,
and others are 
also writing extremely well-reasoned posts refuting the garbage, for
which I'm grateful, but it's far easier for Anonymous Monk and his like
to spin garbage than it is for a small number of us to clean up after
it.  And it does need to be cleaned up, otherwise it festers and
results in even more public garbage <a href='http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2010/04/perl-5-development-resumes-version-512-released.ars?comments=1#comment-20189196'>that someone has to clean up</a>.</p>

<p>I hope that this post will at least encourage more people in the
Perl community to critically examine the things they hear and
read regarding Perl 6, especially when coming from sources with
no apparent standing or reputation within the community.  And
maybe a few more people will even assist in publicly refuting
the garbage ("many hands make light work"), so that the sloppy
thinking, analysis, and dialogue that people like Anonymous Monk
post doesn't spread to infect all of Perl.</p>

<p>Pm</p>

<p>P.S.: Some may reasonably conclude from what I've written
above that Perl 6 is somehow "aiming too high", that our goals 
should be scaled back to make something ready "right now".
I have two responses to this: (1) we <em>are</em> making things
ready 'right now', just grab any of the available packages and
start working and reporting bugs, and (2) there are already 
'scaled back' versions of Perl 6 appearing and being used,
such as NQP or even the components that execute the standard
grammar.  Some of these other projects, like NQP, are being
used for "real" programs and applications today; they're not
simply theoretical exercises or research projects.</p>

<p>Others often claim that all this effort on Perl 6 would be
better spent on improving Perl 5.  In my experience, those of us
working on Perl 6 have absolutely no qualms with seeing Perl 5
improve and continue to grow -- we welcome it.  Indeed,
many of the features appearing in Perl 5 today come directly
from ideas and things first attempted in Perl 6, and we're
genuinely happy to see that.  But just because Perl 6 developers
also like Perl 5 doesn't mean that doing Perl 5 core development is
interesting to us, or that (in my case at least) we'd even be
qualified to do Perl 5 core changes.  We aren't commodity programmers
that are interested in simply being unplugged from one project and
into some other project that others think is more worthwhile.
Personally, I'd prefer to see people who are really into Perl 5
improvements continue to work to make them happen, and that
the surrounding ecosystem continue to evolve to enable that
to happen more easily for more people.  Indeed, this is my wish
for all open-source projects, even the ones I don't find
interesting or otherwise disagree with.</p>

<p>I am continually impressed with your calm, reasoned response to the onslaught of boorish armchair compiler designers.  I don't know why people feel good about attacking other people, but it makes <em>me</em> feel good when I see responses like yours.</p>

<p>Ricardo:
</p><p>Years ago, I was talking with a few others in #perl about how cool perls features were, and you characterised that conversation as a "circle jerk." I wasn't aware of its meaning at that point, so I asked mugwump and he confirmed that it was a derogatory term.

<p>Thanks, Patrick, and also all those others for really doing the hard work. And Thank you for preparing that concise answer. It certainly will not fix the opinions of anonymous persons fearing they could experience something they not already know. Don't care too much for them.
</p><p>If anything then their appearance just demonstrates the heavy impact you work on.
</p><p>"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; because there is not effort without error and shortcomings; but who does actually strive to do the deed; who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotion, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly. So that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat."

<h2>it is sad but it generates value</h2>

It is sad that you need to spend time, energy and feelings on answering silly or nasty accusations instead of spending those with your family or working on Rakudo but there is also a positive side to it.
<p>
You made some very good points (along with chromatic, moritz, Your Mother, petdance, CountZero and probably others) that people like me can use in other situations when talking about Perl 6 and Rakudo.
</p><p>
Thank you for your hard work and patience!

You rock!</p>

<tt>Read your Journal post on "Current State of P6" and wanted to express my<br>support for you/your work and to says "thanks" for taking on a very hard<br>job. I'm only an occasional Perl user - but have a friend who actively<br>contributes and maintains a useful segment of code in Nagios, so I get<br>pointed to interesting stuff like your post.<br>[I'm writing because I don't need to create another login out there in<br>the Web-verse.

Does it help with<br>Programming-in-the-large or Object Oriented programming?<br> I don't think so... Nor do Apple. OS/X, from the iPhone to Mac to<br>Servers, is written in Objective-C.<br>Nor do the bulk of FOSS projects: 'C' is still the lingua franca of the<br>Open Source world.<br><br>Perl (5) is like 'C'.<br>Many people think it 'could be better' and many have tried to create<br>replacements, but its use keeps expanding.<br>'C' is *really* hard to beat, it is (quoting PJ Plauger) "wallpaper -<br>you expect it everywhere" and has base of trained, competent/experienced<br>programmers.<br>'C' is not only 'sufficient' for the range of procedural language tasks,<br>it is excellent on many levels.<br>Like all professional tools, it is 'sharp'.

Getting Things Done, not ideation<br>or criticism.<br>&nbsp; Coulda, Shoulda, Woulda doesn't cut it in the Professional world.<br> - there's another thing to do with Professionals and Engineering:<br>&nbsp; - Is there ever any excuse for a Professional to repeat, or allow<br>repetition of a know Error, Fault or Failure?<br>&nbsp; - Engineering is about Safe, Reliable, Effective and Economical<br>solutions for others.<br><br>There's a very simple example to show the level of Professional Software<br>Engineering embodied in Perl:<br> cpan install.<br><br>Firstly, the source code, in 'C', is available if needed. and its<br>Version controlled, not lost like 40% of pre-Y2K source.<br>There's a well known, robust and simple process to get &amp; install new<br>modules in an absolutely repeatable and predictable manner - with<br>over-rides when needed, not a constrained straight-jacket.<br>The stuff you're downloading has been testing on multiple platforms.

Don't<br>waste my time and yours with hot air.<br><br>And what might Perl 6 achieve?<br>Coming from the 'pens' of highly competent &amp; experienced folk, who've<br>already done this before, it's gotta be close to definitive solution to<br>the problem field it chooses to answer.<br><br>If P6 arrives with an IDE and good, integrated tool-chain, it should<br>scale to Programming-in-the-Large and 'real' programming projects. It<br>won't displace C or Objective-C, but will be a 'slam-dunk' solution to<br>general software practice.<br><br>But in typical Perl style, I expect the Revolution and Conquering the<br>World to be very low-key, even 'stealth mode'.<br>It'll probably pass with a whisper and people may ask, "isn't it obvious<br>to do this?".<br>Or not<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>Many thanks for your years of hard work and contribution at a level I<br>could only wish for.<br><br>(From a former colleague of mine)</tt>
