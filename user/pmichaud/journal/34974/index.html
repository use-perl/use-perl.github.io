<div class="span8">
<p>Over the weekend I've been able to get a lot of new features implemented in NQP, so this is a status and update for NQP.<br/><br/>"What is NQP?"  <br/><br/>Well, NQP stands for "Not Quite Perl (6)", and it's one of the language tools being developed for Parrot.  It's intended to be a lightweight and quick way to write Parrot subroutines and methods using Perl 6 syntax.  In particular, I expect that it will get used for writing other compilers in Parrot, including bootstrapping perl6.<br/><br/>Of course, this begs the question of "why not just use Perl 6 for this?"  <br/><br/>Well, of course, one answer is that we don't have enough of a Perl 6 implementation for this yet.  But even when we do, the full Perl 6 implementation will likely need a substantial runtime library with it, and sometimes people targeting Parrot will want to develop code that doesn't require the entire Perl 6 runtime behind it.  <br/><br/>Also, Perl 6 will have its own idea of classes and objects, and sometimes we want to write code that uses the Parrot core types, or even a different class hierarchy.  <br/><br/>So, NQP is intended to fill this niche of being able to write code for Parrot using a Perl-like syntax, but staying fairly close to the capabilities, structure, and limitations of the Parrot VM.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>Things that have been added to NQP this weekend:<br/><br/>* access symbols in other namespaces
* named argument passing
* method definitions
* module/class declarations ('class' doesn't create the class yet... it just defines the namespace for enclosed methods/subs)
* the 'make' function for result objects in matches (see S05 to find out what this is)<br/><br/>The next step for NQP will be to use it to re-implement "abc" for Parrot, as a proof-of-concept.  "abc" is a bc-clone that has been added to Parrot to illustrate Parrot's compiler tools.  Currently abc is written in a mix of PGE, PIR, and TGE -- but I'm thinking that soon we'll be able to make it almost entirely NQP-based.<br/><br/>After that is working fairly well, the next step will be to migrate the perl6 implementation to also be NQP based.  Stay tuned!<br/><br/>Pm</p>
