<p><p>Today I've checked in the final fix for one of the longest
outstanding bugs inside Parrot.</p>
<p>A short recap:</p>
<p>Having first-class continuation objects is one of the design
goals of Parrot. A lot of HLLs support continuations with some
special syntax and with continuations in the core a lot of HLL
control structures and features like exceptions can be implemented easily.
</p>
<p>But there was a problem with continuations.
Continuations can change the CFG (control flow graph) of a
program in such a way that there are suddenly loops, where the
register allocation code isn't (and can't be) aware of it.</p>

<p>The following code piece from a test provided by <a href="http://www.bofh.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">Piers</a> revealed the whole
problem:</p>
<p> <code>
arr1 = "[1, 3, 5]"<br>
arr2 = "[1, 5, 9]"<br>
x = choose(arr1)<br>
y = choose(arr2)<br>
if (x * y != 15)<br>
fail = find_lex "fail"<br>
fail()</code>
</p>

<p>To the register allocator this looks like a linear control flow,
which is just executed once (there is no loop outside of that code
snippet). But actually the <code>choose</code> closures are capturing
their continuations and are backtracking through the call to the
<code>fail</code> function. We suddenly have a loop going from
<code>fail()</code> to one of the <code>choose()</code> function
call returns. The code that the register allocator should have been
considering would be something like this:</p>

<p> <code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;arr1 = "[1, 3, 5]"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;arr2 = "[1, 5, 9]"<br>
choose_again_1:  # label actually in front of function return<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;x = choose(arr1)<br>
choose_again_2:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;y = choose(arr2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if (x * y != 15)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;fail = find_lex "fail"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;fail()<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;goto choose_again_1 or _2</code> </p>

<p>This implies that the registers
of the variables <code>x, y, arr2</code> can't be reused for example to
assign a register to the <code>fail</code> variable. But exactly this
has happened and the code really "fail"ed.</p>

<p>There were some (IMHO) impractical proposals to fix this, like
refetching all variables from lexicals all the time (and don't use
native integers and numbers because these aren't lexicals) but the
real fix for this is now in: that is - just don't reallocate
the registers used by lexicals and non-volatile variables to other
variables like temporaries.</p>
<p>That's the reason for variable-sized register frames and, well, some
lack of visible progress of Parrot development for some time.</p></p>
