<p><b>WWCPD: Calling Conventions</b>

<p>The original design was not only rather <a
href="http://www.sidhe.org/user/dan/blog/archives/000413.html">heavyweight</a>,
it was also incomplete and a bit blurry. It was lacking
support for MMD argument signatures, return value context,
typechecking, and so on.</p>
<p>I'll try do describe some reasons, why we changed calling conventions
to use a <a
href="http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/docs/pdds/pdd03_calling_conventions.pod">
new abstract scheme</a>. The major change is that all the
argument passing is now done by dedicated opcodes, which
allows any later implementation and adaption under the hood
without changing the ABI of the <a 
href="http://www.parrotcode.org/">Parrot VM</a>.</p>

<b>MMD Signatures</b>

<p>A function call:</p>

<code>  foo(Px, Iy)</code>

<p>was translated to these argument-related opcodes (function
lookup and call opcodes omitted for brevity):</p>

<code>  set I0, 1       # prototyped call<br>
  set I1, 1       # 1 INT argument<br>
  set I2, 0       # 0 STR arguments<br>
  set I3, 1       # 1 PMC argument<br>
  set I4, 0       # 0 NUM arguments<br>
  set P5, Px      # get PMC argument<br>
  set I5, Iy      # get INT argument<br>
  set S0, "foo"   # function name</code>

<p>A lot of opcodes to dispatch, but takes almost no time with
the JIT runtime. Fine so far. Another function call:</p>

<code>  foo(Ix, Py)</code>

<p>produced exactly the same call register setup - these two
function calls can not be discerned when, it comes to multi
method dispatch.</p>

<p>Now the first argument setup just translates to:</p>

<code>  set_args "(0b10,0)", Px, Iy</code>

<p>and the second is:</p>

<code>  set_args "(0,0b10)", Ix, Py</code>

<p>Thus we not only saved 7 opcode dispatches per function
call, we got a clear type information of the caller's
arguments including the argument order. You don't have to
set these type bits yourself, the assembler does it
according to the passed arguments, so just writing: </p>

<code>  set_args "(0,0)", Ix, Py</code>

<p>works fine.</p>

<b>Type checking</b>

<p>In the old scheme you could happily call a function
with:</p>

<code>  foo(Px, Iy)</code>

<p>which was defined as:</p>

<code>  .sub foo<br>
    .param float n<br>
    .param string s</code>

<p>The .param was just translated to:</p>

<code>  foo:<br>
    set Nx, N5      # get 1st NUM param into n<br>
    set Sy, I5      # get 1st STR param into s</code>

<p>Due to the register usage of argument passing the function
would have picked up whatever happens to be in registers N5
and S5 and would run - probably not long though. A possible
"solution" would have been to force all compilers and Parrot
hackers to emit code to first verify the passed arguments.
That's of course another bunch of opcodes, bulky and
error-prone. Now the function defines precisely what it
awaits:</p>

<code>  .sub foo<br>
    get_params "(0b11,0b1)", Nx, Sy</code>

<p>Again the type bits are filled in by the assembler. But
during the call sequence, the argument passing code can
verify the types (and counts) of arguments and parameters.
Conversions to and from PMC parameters are specified and
done automatically. Mismatches are reported by an
exception.</p>

<b>Implicit register usage</b>

<p>The central mechanism of a function call in the old scheme
was just the plain argumentless opcode:</p>

<code>  invoke</code>

<p>It would pick up whatever happens to be in P1 and uses it as
the continuation of the call. P2 was defined to be the
invocant, if it's a method call. And so on - and it call's
whatever is in P0. That's per se fine, if all code writers
and compilers strictly use this convention and don't forget
to NULLify registers that shouldn't be used for the call,
but it's a major PITA for the assembler, which ought to
track the control flow for proper register allocation: is the
invoke a function call, a yield, a return from a function?
Well it's not defined, it could be everything. Not a few
lines inside imcc are trying to track down the usage of invoke
opcodes to do the right thing. You can imagine that this
does not contribute to clear code.</p>

<b>Method invocant</b>

<p>The old call scheme demanded that the invocant is passed
out-of-band in P2. It's also only available in functions
declared as methods by a special <i>interpinfo</i> call. This
doesn't really match our major target languages, where the
invocant just happens to be the first param of a method.</p>

<p>Calling a function as a method or vice versa would have
needed to shift PMC arguments down or up to get everything
into the registers that the callee expects.</p>

<b>Return value context</b>

<p>The old scheme had no provision for specifying, what and how
many return results the caller expects. Now the
<i>get_results</i> opcode is emitted before the actual function
call, so that a function return has a chance to return what
the caller <i>want</i>s.</p>

<b>Future and optimization</b

<p>In the old scheme the lower 16 registers of each kind
were volatile (each function return could set these
registers).  This implies that you usually have to move
registers from the preserved area into the lower half,
during the call sequence registers are moved into the
callee's lower half, from where another round through all
parameters would have placed everything in the preserved
area. This are three passes over all arguments - hardly to
avoid in the general case.</p>

<p>The old call scheme reserved 4*16 registers just for
function calls and returns. This accounts for 320 bytes (on
a 32-bit machine) that have to be allocated per call to pass
e.g. just one word argument to an one-liner function or an
attribute accessor method.</p>

<p>Ok, we are not doing optimzation now - that's fine. But the
old calling scheme would have prevented all future
optimizations that will be needed. You can't do any
optimizations later when the call scheme is carved in stone
and just reserves half of the register resources for
itself.</p>
