<p><p><b>A correction foremost</b></p?
`
<p>A remark WRT the paragraph mentioning type checking
in my <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/leo/journal/25491">first
ewaa journal</a>. It was caused by me
misinterpreting the type conversion specs in <a 
        href="http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/docs/pdds/pdd03_calling_conventions.pod">pdd03</a>. We are
now doing full type conversion, which makes argument
passing strictly positional. That's very likely the
expectation of our <a 
        href="http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/docs/req/model_users.pod">users</a>  anyway. In the old scheme calling a
subroutine:</p>

<p><code>foo(pmc b, str a)   # pseudosyntax to denote argument
types</code></p>

<p>just worked, despite the sub was defined as:</p>

<code>.sub foo<br>
        .param str a<br>
        .param pmc b</code>

<p>Looks weird, but was really used, probably more by
accident then for some good reason. Now you get the first
argument converted to a string and the second as a new
string PMC.</p>

<p><b>Continuations and return context</b></p>
<p>As Dan describes in his <a
        href="http://www.sidhe.org/user/dan/blog/archives/000423.html">blog</a>,
there is not much difference between a subroutine call and
the invocation of a continuation. Both can return results to
the caller. A nice example provided by <a 
        href="http://www.bofh.org.uk/">Piers</a> from Parrot's <a
href="http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/t/op/gc.t">tests</a>
(yeah, number 13) contains something like:</p>

<p><code>x = choose([1, 3, 5])<br>
        y = choose([1, 5, 9])<br>
        if (x * y != 15)<br>
        fail()</code>
</p>
<p>Above is vastly simplified, because the <i>choose</i>
function calls capture their continuations and call a
<i>try</i> closure that either backtracks via the saved
<i>fail </i> hook or delivers the next item from the passed
in choices array. Anyway the interesting thing (for a proper
implementation of continuations) is, that there are
mupltiple continuations that like to return either the next
<i>x</i> or <i>y</i>, when invoked indirectly via the
<i>fail</i> function. These continuations are not only
returning to different program locations they are also
returning different results.</p>
<p>In the source we got this line:</p>
<p><code>our_cc($P3)   # $P3 being one of the next choices</code></p>
<p>where eventually the next result for <i>choose</i> is
to be returned to the main program. It looks like a plain
subroutine call, but invokes the passed in continuation and
ends up, where one of the <i>choose</i> calls had left off.</p>

<p>This means that creating a full continuation still needs
to copy the context structure (which contains also the current
return results location). A return continuation
can just contain a pointer to the refered context.</p>

<p>After having implemented this all now, the rather
complicated tests (p6rules, streams), which are using
continuations as well as coroutines are passing within my
branch (I didn't look at other failing tests yet, but just
converting explicit register usage for call setup to new
conventions should fix almost all). These tests are of
course passing in Parrot svn trunk true, but now (for the
most common case of invoking a return continuation) no
context is copied at all, it's just a matter of putting the pointer
of the captured context into the interpreter.</p>

<p>The official way to do <i>call/cc</i> is still
unchanged, it's:</p>

<code> .include "interpinfo.pasm"<br>
        cc = interpinfo .INTERPINFO_CURRENT_CONT</code>


<p>This usually means that you need a helper subroutine,
where you capture the continuation (and pass it along
somewhere for later usage), it's OTOH a well defined usage of
continuations in e.g. <i>scheme</i>. When things are
settling, I'm sure that we can provide some shortcuts for
capturing continuations inside the same sub (or context)
too.</p>

<p>And implementing <i>want</i> or similar is of course
simple now, as the <i>get_results</i> opcode is emitted
before the subroutine invocation, and is therefore available
for plain function returns as well as for continuations that
return a result. Both can return what the caller
<i>want</i>s, because the information is present in the
context.</p>
