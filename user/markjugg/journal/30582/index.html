<p><p>
I continue working on porting CGI::Application to Perl6. My current work is in <a href="http://mark.stosberg.com/darcs_hive/CGI-Application-p6/">this darcs archive</a>. 
<p>
I was excited about the arrival of "v6", allowing me to write use Perl5 to compile and execute Perl6. While the project remains interesting, it is noticeably slow, and still apparently can't handle a fairly generic hash definition.
<p>
So I broke down and compiled GHC and then pugs on a machine. It took a while, but mostly ran unattended and without error. 
<p>
It's noticeably faster and further along than v6, and allowed me to make a good deal of progress. 
<p> There is still a good deal more to do, though-- CGI::Application doesn't compile yet!
<p>
My reward is that for each new error that comes up, I learn something new about Perl6 syntax in able to fix it. 
<p>
My favorite difference from Perl5 so far is definitely being able to get rid of "my $self = shift;" everywhere. 
<p>
The trend with Perl6 definitely seems to be clearer, simpler, less cluttered syntax styles. 
<p>
Do check out the code and squash some of the compile-time bugs if you want. 
</p>

<h2>I remember when...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2006-08-10T14:28:42</h3>
I used to read flames against Python for having "self" everywhere and then I started with CA and had to do "my $self = shift;" everywhere. I chuckled. I will be glad to get rid of it but it never detracted from CA for me.
