<div class="span8">
<p>I spent some time today wrestling with SQL::Abstract. I've used it and appreciated it for a long time, but have found the syntax too subtle for my tastes, requirng the documentation to be open constantly. 
<P>
Deep into a nested 'WHERE' clause, I found that SQL::Abstract didn't seem to support the kind of  AND/OR nesting I needed. Although it was slightly complex, nesting AND and OR clauses is <i>not</i> exotic SQL. 
</P>
<P>I got on the research train and rode it until I found <a href="http://www.math2.org/david/sql_interpolate/">SQL::Interpolate</a>. I tried, love it, and recommend it. Actually, I only tried one simple method, <pre>sql_interp</pre> which may be the only one I ever need. 
</p>
<p>You won't need to keep the manual handling when using this module, because the syntax is very natural.</p>

<p>The core need for a SQL-generation module in the first place is that bind variables are a pain in the ass to manage. That, and a group of key/value pairs is more natural to manage as a hash. </P>

<P>With SQL::Interpolate, you can just write out normal SQL, and then drop in a Perl data structure  
where you would need to manage a bind variable, or when a hashref would be a handy way to express yourself. It will best illustrated by example: 

<pre>
my ($stmt,@bind) = sql_interp 
"INSERT INTO table", {color => $new_color,
                      shape => $new_shape};

my ($stmt,@bind) = sql_interp qq[
      UPDATE table SET ],
          {color => $new_color,
           shape => $new_shape}, qq[
      WHERE color <> ], \$color
 
  my($sql, @bind) = sql_interp qq[
      SELECT * FROM table WHERE color IN], \@colors, qq[
          AND y = ], \$x
</pre> 

It has some more advanced variations to make this even easier, but I'm satisfied with this technique for now.

<h2>Very nice indeed</h2>

I'll have to read it and its source before I decide anything, but I think I am going to use this for DBIx::Simple's $db-&gt;query method. Or maybe as $db-&gt;iquery, in case it is not backwards compatible. It does appear to be, though.<br> <br>Or possibly as a different method because abstraction hurts performance. I'll have to think about this, and bench it a little.<br> <br>Thanks for sharing this!

Which means I'm not going to use it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(

If it's really that useful, then maybe the author should be poked into putting it on CPAN. He does seem to have a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/dmanura/" title="cpan.org">PAUSE ID</a cpan.org>, but he doesn't seem to have actually have done anything with it, until now.
<p>Perhaps he's just wary of the hassle of putting something on CPAN for the very first time, from scratch. In which case he might welcome a guiding hand.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) (I know I'm like that.)</p>

I've already contacted him, just after writing my previous post. Let's see if we can get this thing into CPAN.

<h2>What about support for joins</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/knowmad/">knowmad</a> on 2004-12-09T05:32:53</h3>
Hey Mark,<br> <br>This looks like a useful module. Thanks for sharing it. It still appears that supporting joins continues to elude authors of SQL interpolation modules.<br> <br>I've spoken with Nathan Wiger, the author of SQL::Abstract, and he'd like to support joins but does not have a good idea of how to implement this support. David does not mention anything about limitations of his module or support for joins. I wonder what his position on this support is.<br> <br>William
