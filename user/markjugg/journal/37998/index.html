<h1> HTTP::Engine drops Moose for Shika, gains massive speedup</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>When I <a
href="http://mark.stosberg.com/blog/2008/11/startup-benchmarks-for-mojo-catalyst-titanium-httpengine-and-cgiapplication.html">recently benchmarked</a> several Perl website development tools, HTTP::Engine had dismal
performance. The slowest performer, it took 1.5 seconds just to print "Hello
World" in a CGI environment and took 14.6 megs of memory to it. 
<p>
Today the first HTTP::Engine release appeared that replaces <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moose">Moose</a> with <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Shika">Shika</a>. Shika provides the
essential class-building tools that HTTP::Engine needs with a Moose-compatible
syntax, and strips out the rest of the magic. 
<p>
The performance improvement was dramatic. The "Hello World" time dropped to
0.19seconds on the same hardware (almost 10 times as fast!) and the memory
usage dropped to 6.6 Megs.
<p>
Catalyst is currently slated to use Moose in the next major version. Now that
HTTP::Engine has switched away from Moose for better performance and memory
savings, will other projects follow suit?

<p>I wonder what would've happened if Mouse was tried first.</p>

<p>... CGI performance is irrelevant, since nobody uses CGI anymore.  Modern Perl trades compile-time speed for runtime speed.  If you think it's a good idea to recompile your application every time there is a web request, then you should probably not use Catalyst or HTTP::Engine.</p><p>FWIW, Shika is being rolled into Mouse, which means HTTP::Engine will soon be both fast and easily compatible with Moose and Moose extensions... and every other user of Moose/Mouse gets that speed for free!</p>

<p>Really? I use Perl in a CGI environment all the time because that is all that is available to me at work and it is cheap (and I do small sites) with hosting providers.</p><p>Is there a cheap mod_perl hosting site?</p>



<h2>Re:Of course...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2008-12-02T13:18:36</h3>
<p>Oh...but I agree I wouldn't use Catalyst for a CGI site because that isn't what it is designed for. I use CGI::Application and I may be trying Mojo very soon as well.</p>

<p><em>... CGI performance is irrelevant, since nobody uses CGI anymore.</em>.</p><p>That's just BS. I use vanilla CGI plenty, and it has never been the source of declaring that an application was too slow or otherwise inappropriate technology. I back up the <a href="http://mark.stosberg.com/blog/2008/11/the-benefits-of-vanilla-cgi-vs-fastcgi-for-perl-apps.htmlbenefitsofvanillaCGI" title="stosberg.com">benefits of vanilla CGI</a stosberg.com> specific details on hosting availability and expected performance limits where CGI quits being a good choice.</p><p>I totally agree that Catalyst apps would run too slow in vanilla CGI, but Catalyst alone does not define "modern Perl".</p><p>Even Catalyst's new competitor <a href="http://mojolicious.org/" title="mojolicious.org">Mojo</a mojolicious.org> (from Catalyst own original author) runs decently in CGI with many of the same features. Clearly taking a long time to load is not a prerequisite for being "modern".</p>

<p><i>Mojo runs decently in CGI with many of the same features.</i></p><p>The features aren't really the same.  Try doing something like <tt>Some::Role-&gt;meta-&gt;apply( $c-&gt;request )</tt>.  A lot of Moose (and Catalyst) imitators steal the sugar, but the sugar is not the power... the internal consistency and extensibility is.</p><p>Anyway, doesn't matter much if all you want to do is get some crap out of a database and add some HTML tags around it.

If someone wants to start with a lighter-weight framework and use it combination with Moose, they are quite welcome to. <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/FAYLAND/DayDayUp-0.06/lib/DayDayUp/Context.pm" title="cpan.org">DayDayUp</a cpan.org> is Mojo-based, and also brings in Moose.
<p>
However, there's no way to use the new Catalyst without Moose, if you don't want the overhead of loading Moose feature which won't be used.</p>

<h2>What&amp;#8217;s the point?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2008-12-03T16:17:47</h3>
<p>What&#8217;s the use of HTTP::Engine when you&#8217;re running under CGI anyway? Might as well cut out the middle men and just use CGI::Simple. At least then you have no worries about latency.</p><p>It doesn&#8217;t provide a sensible upgrade path anyway, since engineering for minimal startup time is so different from engineering for a persistent environment. You don&#8217;t want to just take a CGI script verbatim and run it as a server, even if that script happens to be written against HTTP::Engine.</p>

<p>I think a "use case" might be something like Movable Type. When they distribute it, they don't know ahead of time whether it will be deployed in CGI, FastCGI, or mod_perl, so they code it work in all three, and could HTTP::Engine to abstract which backend is in use.</p><p>I actually use Movable Type in CGI because it was easy to deploy that way, and nearly all the public parts are rendered as static HTML. The admin interface is a bit slow, but I'm not the only user and it's fast enough for me.</p><p>Currently the Movable Type has "$ENV{MOD_PERL}" conditional logic throughout the code base... it's rather messy. Switching to HTTP::Engine (or similar) would be a big improvement for that kind of project.</p><p>I would agree that if you only ever plan to deploy in CGI, than an extra backend abstraction layer is just extra waste and complexity.</p>
