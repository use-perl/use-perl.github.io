Speaking up poor use of technology by large corporations, each month now I get a statement from Cingular Wireless, where I am longer a customer. The statement says that they owe me one cent, and there is no need for me to send payment. 
</p>
<p>
I tried to contact them to tell them this was stupid, but they apparently don't allow former custoe
mers to call them. I'm prompted to put in my phone number, which they don't recognize as valid. 
So, I just recycle the statement and wait for the next one. (Realize: this probably costs them at least 50 cents to mail each month). 
<p>
The penny statements begin coming after I got another peculiar statement: One that said I owed them 11 cents. I called and asked to have that charge removed, which they prompty did, but apparently by overcrediting my account by a penny...
<p>
HEY CINGULAR! I hope you read my blog since I can't call you: <em>You can keep the penny!</em>
