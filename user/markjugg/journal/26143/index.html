<div class="span8">
<p>As I worked on <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/markjugg/journal/26089">a new plugin system for HTML::Template</a>, I recycled code from
<a href="http://www.cgi-app.org/?Plugins">CGI::Application's new plugin system</a>.
<P>

As I reflected on this, CGI::Application has developed a nice plugin system
which is easily re-usable on it's own.
<P>
It is most similar to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Class::Trigger">Class::Trigger</a>, but I think the CGI::App solution is
more advanced for these reasons:

<ul>
 <LI> We look up the inheritance tree for more callbacks to execute

 <LI> We allow arguments to be passed into the callbacks, customizing how each
   callback can work, and creating clearer, more explicit syntax than passing
   through the object.

 <LI> We have a specific callback ordering, and we expect to soon solve the
   problem of making this ordering to be sufficiently flexible to address
   most plugin needs. 

 <LI> Class::Trigger requires your object be implemented as blessed hashref
   (Gasp!). We could solve this in our implementation by adding a method for
   'installed_callbacks()', which could be trivially overridden if the
   callbacks needed to be stored in the object a different way.
</ul>

So I would like to move CGI::App's plugin system into it's own module, which
wouldn't change anything from a user's perspective, except perhaps where the
related documentation is located. 
<p>
I could see what we have possibly being merged into a future enhanced version
of Class::Trigger, which CGI::App would then have it's own plugin for, to keep 
compatibility with the names we've already established.
<p>
Collaborators welcome! Let's keep discussing it on the CGI::Application mailing
list and #cgiapp on irc.perl.org.
<P>
