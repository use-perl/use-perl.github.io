<h1>CGI.pm uploading bugs fixed</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>Some years ago, I noticed an oddity when using CGI.pm file uploads.  File uploading only worked on first object I created. If I called CGI->new() again, the file upload would be gone. <br/><br/>At the time, I considered file uploading to a difficult and mysterious area, and assumed it "had to be this way", so I didn't file a bug report, and learned to work around the issue. <br/><br/>"CGI.pm is very popular" I reasoned. "Therefore, obvious bugs in it would be spotted and repaired." <br/><br/>For years, I avoided the problem by using CGI::Application and related plugins. It loads CGI.pm just once and provides access to it through a "query" method. So, as long as all the plugins use this method and don't access CGI.pm directly, the bug can continue avoided. <br/><br/>Finally, however, it bit me again recently in a way that was very hard to track down. Suddenly, we  were getting weird empty files. This seemed impossible, as the files clearly existed and were being validated by Data::FormValidator::Constraints::Upload. <br/><br/>The files were "disappearing" because they weren't available on a second call to CGI->new. <br/><br/>This time, I had more experience and a different attitude. I decided this might be a solvable bug, and I dove into the CGI.pm guts to investigate. <br/><br/>This time around, I also had an understanding how to write an automated test for a file upload, which had also been a mystery in the past.<br/><br/>The result was that I was able to verify the issue was real, *and* solvable, and those fixes are what's new in CGI.pm 3.29:<br/><br/>http://search.cpan.org/src/LDS/CGI.pm-3.29/Changes<br/><br/>The moral, though, is to not settle for working around weird, mysterious behavior. At least report it to a user's mailing list for the software, or be adventuresome and dive into the code and poke around. <br/><br/>The fix for the issue was not particular hard and the symptoms were certainly obvious to those who ran into it. I can only conclude that the bug existed for years unfixed because other people like me had an attitude that the issue was "just mysterious" or couldn't be fixed. <br/><br/></p>

<h2>Good work!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2007-04-17T19:23:23</h3>
<p>Awesome work!  I hope I someday have the boldness to plunge into code like Net::SFTP::Foreign and fix bugs I've found.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>BTW, an entry on how you did the test would be interesting to people like me, who have a vague idea how they might go about such a test but still probably regard it as black magic.  Is this a test that's going to run every time I and every other installer of this module do a make test?  Is it something that's going to fail if I'm not connected to the net (or required to access the web through a proxy)?</p>

<h2>how to test file uploads</h2>

You can look at t/upload.t in the CGI.pm distribution to see how the test works. The crux of it is that I reverse engineered what the environment and "POST" contents of a file upload looked like, and then I faked it so that a call to CGI-&gt;new() thinks a real file upload is happening.<br><br>If you want to test a file upload in a private project, that's a lot of trouble to go through. I would recommend Test::WWW::Mechanize::CGI instead.<br><br>That didn't exist when I was first figuring out how to test file uploads, otherwise I probably never would have figured out the technique. The only benefit of directly mocking-up the POST is that you don't have all the dependencies of Test::WWW::Mechanize::CGI. That whole dependency chain would be a pain to ship with CGI.pm just for a few tests.<br><br>

<p>
Good work! I think it's always preferable to fix such problems (at least if the source is available and you are allowed to modify it) rather than
work around it.
