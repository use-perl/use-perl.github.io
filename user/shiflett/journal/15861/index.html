<p><p>
Today was as busy as yesterday, and I've realized that it's impossible to give an
accurate account of a day at ApacheCon. This is especially true when I try to
remember everything that happened late at night or sometime the following day.
</p>
<p>
I spent much of the day hacking and was able to meet and hang out with more people -
<a href="http://www.modperlcookbook.org/user/geoff/">Geoff</a>, 
<a href="http://www.stason.org/">Stas</a>, 
<a href="http://www.schlossnagle.org/user/jesus/scriptures/">Theo</a>,
<a href="http://www.coggeshall.org/">John</a>,
<a href="http://www.trachtenberg.com/">Adam</a>,
and <a href="http://www.caseywest.com/">Casey</a> are the people whose faces (and
names) come to mind. <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/gnat/">Nat</a> was speaking opposite
<a href="http://www.lerdorf.com/">Rasmus</a> at some PHP versus Perl (versus Java,
but who cares about Java?) talk at Comdex. Casey and I took the shuttle over there
to listen in, but we discovered that it would cost $1600.00 to watch the talk. That
idea was quickly canned.
</p>
<p>
I went to dinner with Sams. Others in the party were Geoff, Stas, John, 
<a href="http://www.rcbowen.com/">Rich</a>,
<a href="http://www.lyra.org/greg/">Greg</a>,
Shelley (an editor at Sams - the host),
and a few other people. After dinner, we all headed to a bar to hang out but got
separated in the process. Several of us walked over to the Luxor, and Geoff and
I watched a haunted house movie on IMAX, which was very cool (it was in 3D).
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow is my talk (already available
<a href="http://shiflett.org/talks/apachecon2003">here</a>, with all examples
disabled, because they demonstrate security vulnerabilities), so I plan to go 
over my slides, and possibly do some last minute tweaking, before I get some
sleep.
