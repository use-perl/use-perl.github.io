<p>We've decided to go down the route of C#/perl for future projects, mainly due to lack of GUI goodness for perl. I've been prodding slowly at C#, dipping my toes in the water.
<p>
One thing that stumped me for about an hour today is 'optional' parameters. I was trying to call the <tt>Navigate</tt> method for the web browser control. In VB I would have ignored the optional parameters as they are optional (cunning eh?). C# doesn't think this is a good idea, and after a little digging I found you need to do:
<p><tt>
object o = null;
<br>webbrowser.Navigate(url, ref o, ref o, ref o, ref o);
</tt></p>
Which looks plain dumb. Oh well. <p>I should also motivate myself to file some Komodo bug reports, but I feel these should have been stomped on before release. Ho Hum.</p>

The fact that you're using C# tells me that you're using MS Windows and possibly<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET.  If so, you have a few good options (besides Komodo).
<p>
Visual Perl.  If you're using the Visual Studio software, Visual Perl is very nice.  You can get it at activestate.com.  I think it's about $100.
</p><p>
PerlBuilder at solutionsoft.com.  Pretty good, aimed somewhat at CGI programmers.  About $150 for the standard version, $250 for the pro version.
</p><p>
Your free option is <a href="http://open-perl-ide.sourceforge.net/" title="sourceforge.net">OpenIDE</a sourceforge.net>.  Better than Komodo by a long shot, but then it only supports Perl.</p>

We paid out the $495 for <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ASPN_Perl/index.plex" title="activestate.com">ASPN Perl</a activestate.com>. I'm pretty pleased with it so far. I've only really been using Komodo as Visual Studio<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET still scares me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

I'm downloading (very slowly) OpenIDE right now. It looks very cool, and exactly what I've been looking for running on Windoze. Over the last week I've been toying w/ Project Builder on MacOS X, and it rocks! It has all the features you'd expect out of an editor/IDE, and then some. So anything that comes close to PB is a good thing. Thanks for the link.

Have you taken a look at possibilities like <a href="http://wxperl.sourceforge.net/" title="sourceforge.net">wxPerl</a sourceforge.net>, Tk, Gtk or Win32::GUI???<br> <br>
There is enough GUI goodness for Perl!<br> <br>

I have. Tk is pretty much ruled out becuase it doesn't look like a windows application. This might sound harsh, but it makes sense for us. I have experimented with Tk, I sent a small app to a client and he was frustrated by the file open dialog as it had a 'home' button that didn't work and you couldn't choose a disk/networked drive.
<p>
wxPerl looks promising but the lack of documentation is a factor. I'm also not sure if I'm that keen on creating forms without a GUI. The Visual Studio<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET GUI is very slick and impressive. Microsoft always seems to excel at this.</p>

I agree completely on the Tk story. wxPerl indeed lacks documentation (working on it Sir!), but what do you mean by creating forms without a GUI? wxPerl is all about GUI....<br> <br>

You need <a href="http://www.kristi.ca/programming/dirselect.html" title="kristi.ca">Tk::DirSelect</a kristi.ca> (follow the link to downloads and screenshots)</p>

I actually found that today, but couldn't get the code to work. I wanted a widget that could select a directory. Eventually I found some code that got a Tk::DirTree and worked ok (linked towards the bottom of that page). The main problem I have is that Tk programs look icky. Tk::DirSelect looks <b>really</b> amateur compared to today's graduated fills, recessed buttons etc on win32.
