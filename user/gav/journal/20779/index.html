<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068935/">Return of the Dragon</a>: In some ways Bruce Lee's best film, great fight scenes, a classic showdown at the end, somewhat marred by a poor quality print, dreadful overdubbing, and a so-so story. The real highlights are Lee showing off with nunchaku and the showdown in the colloseum with a young Chuck Norris, watched by a cute kitten. Seven-time world champion Norris pits his Karate agains Lee's Jeet Kun Do. It's one of the most impressive fighting sequences on film, and it's worth the wait, even though you know that the good guy can't lose. I've always wondered if the fight had taken place for real who would win.</p></p>

<h2>Ah so...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/zatoichi/">zatoichi</a> on 2004-09-08T09:18:24</h3>
Well, as much as I admire Bruce Lee, I believe Norris would have won. I think there are interviews with one or both that says as much.



<h2>Real?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2004-09-08T13:24:28</h3>
The rumor I always heard was that it wasn't entirely fake.



<h2>Jet Li would beat both their ass</h2>

At least in theory, what with him being a world champion at Wushu (official chinese sport based on kungfu).
<p>
Sadly, I doubt either would last long in the ring with any decent Thai Boxer, Thai vs $any_other_martial_art tends to end with the Muay Thai practitioner doing serious harm to the other party regardless of style or technique.
</p><p>
If you compare any real Karate Tourney footage to that of Muay Thai, its like comparing semi-contact to full-contact all over again.
</p><p>
Saying that, I have studied kung fu under a world full contact champion, and he is impressive, his instructor is even more impressive, and the sifu chief instructor visits in china are more impressive still.
