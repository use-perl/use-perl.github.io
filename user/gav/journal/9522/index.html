<p>This week has been a bit of a film fest. On Sunday I watched <a href="
http://us.imdb.com/Title?0253754">Star Trek Nemesis</a>. It's certainly not <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0084726">Wrath of Khan</a>, though it tries hard to be, but it's pretty good with decent special effects and it's a cut above <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0092007">the crappy one with the whales</a>.
<p>
Tonight I watched Michael Moore's <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0310793">Bowling for Columbine</a>, a poinent look at America's obsession with guns. He delves into the culture of fear in this country and looks for the reasons behind violence. Very much worth watching.
<p>
I've got my tickets booked for the Two Towers (almost wrote Twin Towers there for a second) this Thursday, unfortunately everything was sold out for tomorrow. No spoilers please if you are lucky enough to see it tomorrow :)
<p>
Work wise I had a 90 min conference call to try to secure a deal to develop a Yahoo store for a ex-dot-com who spent a lot of money on a proprietary Java platform and are looking to downsize. It would be nice if we get it, though it would mean a lot of work for the Jan 1st launch! 
<p>
In other news it looks like my boss wants to work on a desktop application instead of a rewrite of some of our web based services which is a bit of a depressing concept. I am also contemplating something nasty for the next person who says "<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/petdance/journal/7575">Can't you just...</a>".
