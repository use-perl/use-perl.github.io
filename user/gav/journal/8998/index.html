<p>Things seem to be coming together now. I've got <a href="http://www.pollet.net/GLterm/">GLTerm</a> working which I vastly prefer over the built in Terminal app. I've got <a href="http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/#vim">Vim</a> replacing the default vi (I tried the <a href="http://macvim.swdev.org/OSX/">carbon vim</a>, but the fonts in GLTerm are nicer). I've build my own Perl 5.8 from source. I've got Chimera installed as my default browser. I've got <a href="http://www.stuffonfire.com/software/">JediKnight2</a> for irc (best free client I could find) and MS Messenger. I've managed to install <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</a>, which took forever and hopefully when that's finished updating, which seems to be taking forever, I hopefully can get ncftp and wget. I'm now attempting to  install MySQL. I feel quite proud of myself.

I clicked on messages to make the exact same comment.<p>

When I "Switched" from Linux/X11 to an iBook, the only thing I couldn't find was an IRC client that didn't make me want to rip out what's left of my hair. I settled on Snak, Jedi Knight really pissed me off.</p><p>

I had used XChat on Linux, and tried it on OSX under XDarwin, but didn't like having to run XDarwin just for one app, and I had cut and paste problems.</p><p>

XChatAqua, even though it's only about 80% of the functionality of full blown XChat, already blows away anything else on OS X. I'm in love. I just noticed that there's a newer version for download, and if it lets me set the background color of windows, it will be damn near perfect.</p><p>

I traded some emails with the Author. He actually rewrote all the GUI portions of it to talk to Aqua instead of X11, this is no hack. And he did an amazing job.</p>
