<a href="http://www.cdnow.com">CDNOW</a> had a great deal where club CDs were an extra 20% off (on top of the $5 credit you get). It worked out that I'm getting 7 CDs for about $52. My <a href="http://www.cdnow.com/taf_gift/gavin@estey.com">wish list</a> now has (only) 20 albums on it. The RIAA should send me thank you letter.  
<p>
I upgraded <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> on <a href="http://www.estey.com">estey.com</a> (to 2.5) which was surprisingly painless. Good job Ben and Mena!
<p>
My new server should be arriving next weekend sometime and I'm anxious to get it up and running so I can have something to test on. It's a dual 550, compared to a single 450 in <a href="http://chicken.bock.com">chicken</a> which is nice, though the load average on chicken barely registers above 0.0. The reason for buying chicken in the first place was so I could have a server to play on without worrying about breaking something important. Now it's running nice and smoothly I'm scared to fiddle too much in case I break it. 
<p>
Work wise, the <a href="http://search.ehobbies.com">search</a> for <a href="http://www.ehobbies.com">eHobbies</a> is now more or less finished. They now have nearly 40,000 extra products in their search that aren't in their store due to limitations of <a href="http://store.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>. 
<p>
I'm going to be doing some work for <a href="http://www.wickedtemptations.com/">Wicked Temptations</a> which should be interesting. They mostly sell what I would call "porn clothing" :)
<p>
I've also started looking into <a href="http://siesta.sourceforge.net/">Siesta</a> which looks very promising. </p>
