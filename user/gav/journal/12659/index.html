<p><p>This week I thought I would be joining the ranks of new car owners. I had enough money for a good down payment, the deal was good (0% finance for 60 months), and I was going to be the proud owner of a new <a href="http://www.saturn.com/ionqc3/">Saturn</a>. My aging '93 SL1 has 148,800 miles on it now and it was time for something better.</p><p>All I needed to do is check to see how much my insurance would be. The increase would be from $108 to $322 a month, nearly 30% more than the car payment would be. Assuming I own the car for 60 months and insurance rates not going up, I would pay 15% more  in insurance than the car was worth. Does the insurance company figure my chance of writing the car off in that time to be 85%?</p>
<p>It looks like I'm not going to have a new car :(</p>

#1 where do you live? I know that Delaware's car insurance is like HALF of what Jersey's is, which is one of many reasons I moved here.<br> <br>#2 What about switching insurance companies and getting a better estimate?

Sounds like you live in an high insurance rate area, and you've picked a very desirable car.  I took a look at the Saturn Ion-3 site you pointed out and the cool doors and the cool-looking instrument cluster make for a car the theives would love to get their hands on.<br> <br>Sounds like a Corolla is in your future.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>(I drive a Ford Taurus wagon, BTW).
