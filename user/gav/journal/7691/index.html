Has anyone ever though of using Template Toolkit to write perl scripts? 
</p>
<p>
I have a set of scripts for different clients that share perhaps 50% common code. Instead of refactoring and moving the shared code to modules I had a crazy idea about using a set of templates to write out the scripts, with the template filling in the shared bits. 
</p>
<p>
My original idea ran something along these lines:
</p>
<ul>
<li>From parameters determine what client is calling script</li>
<li>Pull rule set from database, do transforms on input</li>
<li>Create query, run against database</li>
<li>Push results through client's template</li>
</ul>
<p>
The code generation approach would have a separate script for each client (all running nicely under Apache::Registry of course) generated by the template and updated (rarely) when the client's data changes. In this case there wouldn't be a script and a template, just the script itself.
</p>
<p>This seems an interesting route to follow, though it seems a bit wacky to me. I'll have to think about it a little further and see if I can come up with an example or two. I'm sure there are some big disadvantages which I haven't considered yet :)
</p>
<p>
Any thoughts?
</p></p>

<h2>Templated Perl Scripts?</h2>

Yes.  It's late.  Get some sleep before you start hacking.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
If you've got a lot of common code that's mostly similar except for a few parameters, that's a sign you should centralize your common code in a <i>module</i>, not a template to simplify cargo cult coding (dynamically generated or otherwise).  Your first instincts were correct.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
</p><p>
There are instances where template-generated Perl scripts <i>would</i> be useful.  I've thought about hacking/replacing <tt>h2xs</tt> so it becomes a tool to <i>start</i> common projects -- I want a new mod_perl handler, a new CGI program, a new command line utility, a new SAX handler,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.... and I <b>don't</b> want the static boilerplate (by A. U. Thor<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...)</p>

<p>
Another benefit to modules is that you can pre-load them when Apache starts.  This  has the potential to save quite a bit of memory, sharing them across child processes.  (Modules also tend to be much easier to test than scripts.)
