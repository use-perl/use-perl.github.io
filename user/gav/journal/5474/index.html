Having run out of shaving gel and forgetting to get some while he was at the shops last night gav wandered into work today looking rather scruffy, not aided by the fact that he was a week past the you-should-really-get-a-haircut stage and that his beard tends toward ginger after 3 days or so.

I managed to find some <a href="http://www.shave.com/site/docs/kos.stm">King of Shaves</a> shaving gel. I used to buy this in the UK but haven't been able to buy it here, it's expensive but packed full of methol (really wakes you up in the morning) and clear (so you can see your face). Fantastic stuff, I felt the urge to splash out and buy $25 (inc p&p) of the stuff. Seems strange ordering online, especially due to the site being in the UK :)
<p>
Also while we are on a shaving theme, I'd like to wholeheartedly recommend the <a href="http://www.shaving.com">Schick</a> (silly name, annoying website in a new window thingy)  
Xtreme 3 razor. It looked like a good idea, my face is curved after all, and it works great. 
<p>
I also took the opportunity to take out my clippers and shave my head so I now look like the criminal who has his photo in my passport :) 
<p>
I had to buy a mop as I left mine in a bucket of bleach all weekend and it melted. I was quite confused buy the various mop styles and ended up buying one of those new fangled wring ones (a cheaper imitation of <a href="http://www.rollomatic.com/athome/products/featured.html">one of these</a>). I now have a kitchen floor without sticky patches :)
<p>
After all that hard work I relaxed on my new (second hand) laz-e-boy and enjoyed a few heinekens whilst watching <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0252503">Heist</a> which seemed very similar to <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0227445">The Score</a>. Pretty good anyway, I'd give it 3/5. 
<p>
Hmm... I'll have to find something more exiciting than my life to write about :)

<h2>Shaving Gels</h2>

<p>All the men in  my girlfriends family use King of Shaves, but I don't like it.  I get a <a href="http://www.bodyshop.com/uk/products/mens.asp" title="bodyshop.com">shaving cream</a bodyshop.com> from the Body Shop which has lots of gelatine in it and softens my face up beautifully.  It does require you to use a brush to apply it, but I vastly prefer that to getting my hands covered in icky gel...
