<p>I did mean to write something earlier but sheer laziness has twarted me (yet again!). I need somebody to program something that I shall call SOAP::Brain which allows me to think up journal entries and have them magically appear.
<p>
The first order of the day is a short review. I've just got back from seeing <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0187738">Blade II</a>. Pretty good film, I concur with the 7.2 from IMDB. I'm not sure if it is better or worse than the orginal, if you didn't like that you probably won't like this. The story is a bit silly but it is fun, with plenty of great action scenes and some gory freaky vampire things (called reapers). 
<p>
The cast is pretty interesting, Luke Goss, of the band Bros plays the bad guy. Bros were a kinda local band to where I grew up and went to my high school (how embrarassing). Donnie Yen, who was in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0108148">Iron Monkey</a> (great film btw) has a dissapointing role, he really doesn't get to do much.
<p>
Hmm... other things...
<p>
Have you noticed that British guys get a very strange portrayal in American TV/Movies. They are always the bad guy, see <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Irons,+Jeremy">Jeremy Irons</a> or <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Oldman,+Gary">Gary Oldman</a>. Not that they don't play <b>good</b> bad guys of course! On TV we don't have bad guys we have chick magnets (see 'Off Center' or 'Undeclared'). I'd like to stand up for all the non-bad-guy non-chick-mangent British men... and... uhm... perhaps I should stop digging (*throws down shovel*).
<p>
I guess as this is use.perl I should make some remote effort to mention perl things. Firstly I'd like to thank some people that have made my life easier in the last week:
<ul>
<li>Hal Pomeranz for Text::ParseWords</li>
<li>Gisle Aas/Sean Burke for HTML::TreeBuilder</li>
<li>Ned Konz for Algorithm::Diff (I have plans to attempt cool stuff with this next week)</li>
</ul>
<p>
I have been using <a href="http://www.activestate.com">Activestate's</a> Komodo as my perl ide for the last week (my boss bought me ASPN Perl), replacing textpad as the syntax highlighting was starting to piss me off. I'm quite impressed with Komodo, there are a few bugs but nothing too annoying, the syntax highlighting and auto-compiling (puts squiggly red underlines under errors as you type like word does for spelling errors) are great. It does take up 30 ish meg of memory, but then memory is cheap these days.
<p>
I haven't used much else of the kit yet apart from PerlApp. I love PerlApp, I can bundle perl scripts to clients with no hassle, put together an installer with <a href="http://www.nullsoft.com/free/nsis/">NSIS</a> and not have to worry that they will have perl, the right modules, try to move it to another machine or try to edit it.
<p>
I'm starting on a big project that uses C#/Perl. This is mainly as the thought of not having CPAN to draw on scares me, and that GUI programming with perl just doesn't cut it. I'll be writing more about how well/badly this is going in the next few weeks.
<p>
Well that's about it, can't think of anything else to say :)</p>

Blimey, that brings back memories.  Luke was the drummer wasn't he?  My sister had Bros posters on her bedroom wall back in the day.
