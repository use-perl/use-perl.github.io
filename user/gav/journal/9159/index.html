<p><p>I get four days off work this thanksgiving, the longest holiday I've had since xmas. I am looking forward to moving stuff into my newly painted office. One nice thing about having the iBook is that I can work in my living room, which feels a lot better than working in my room. This is pretty strange as I live by myself, but it seems less lonely than my bedroom.</p>

<p>It's nice to know that the people decorating the office under ours have absolutly no regard for our well being. They've put some kind of varnish or something down (after spending yesterday loudly sanding the floor) which has made most of the building reek of a horrid solvent smell. It's so bad a couple of people have gone home early, but (luckily?) I'm in the back room which is a bit better ventilated. The workmen were nice enough to go home and building management can't even open the windows because the floor is sticky. My suggestion of going outside with duct tape and a hammer to break the windows is being ignored.</p></p>
