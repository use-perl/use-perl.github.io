<p><p>I've seen "<a href="http://asktog.com/columns/062top10ReasonsToNotShop.html">Top 10 Reasons to Not Shop On Line</a>" by Bruce "Tog" Tognazzini linked to from quite a few places. I think he's full of crap. Not that I'm defending poor e-commerce companies, there are a lot out there that suck.</p>
<p>I started writing an explanation of why he's wrong, but after reading through my notes I find that I can simplify it to one bullet point:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tog is full of crap</b></li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Ogg Say Tog Write Bad Crap</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2004-02-17T17:36:25</h3>
<p>Wow.  That was a pretty awful article.  Many of those items apply to meatspace shopping, too (bad promotions and insufficient information).  Sheesh.</p>

<p>In descending order of importantce, here's my top ten list of why you shouldn't shop online.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Security</li>

<p>Except for an oblique and confused reference, Tog missed the boat on security.</p>

Security is one of my least concerns about shopping online. I don't think that it's any less secure to shop online than off.

+1 Insightful:<br> <blockquote><div> <i>So why can&#8217;t I input my credit card number the way it appears on the card? Why do I have to suck the extra spaces out, making it all but impossible to re-scan it for errors? We&#8217;re talking three spaces here, three bytes. We&#8217;re talking a loop to scan for those characters that can be accomplished in couple of microseconds.</i> </div></blockquote> <br>This is pet peeve #41 for me.  Come on, can't anybody do <code>$cc =~ s/\D+//g;</code>?<br> <br>-1 Contradictory:<br> <br>First: <blockquote><div> <i>If you go into a bricks and mortar store, you have at least three sources of information: [...] 4. Bonus: An 800 number printed on the box, accessible on the spot with a cell phone.</i> </div></blockquote> <br>Later: <blockquote><div> <i>American Express is apparently unaware that e-commerce is done with a computer, not a phone.</i> </div></blockquote> <br>Huh?



<h2>Lame</h2>

That whole thing is pretty lame, but when he actually expected me to believe I can get more and better information in a store than online, I Just gave up reading.  Online, I have access to -- almost every time -- the same printed information as in the store, including manuals, and salespeople are almost always wrong about something that I can find out online.<br> <br>It's true that the online stores themselves don't often have all the information, but I can change web sites pretty easily.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
