<p>My new iBook is unpacked and sitting on my desk. It looks so new and shiny. When I have some time I'll work out how to get wireless going with my linksys wap11 (still in the box) and start get things working how I like.

I'm going to have fun this weekend, I'm a kid with a new toy :)

In July I bought an iBook and a Wap11.<br> <br>unboxed the iBook, plugged in an ethernet cable, booted it up, it worked, I was able to surf the web.<br> <br>Went into my basement where my firewall was located, unboxed the wap11, plugged in power, plugged in an ethernet cable.<br> <br>Walked back upstairs and the iBook had already found the wireless net. And that was it.<br> <br>Now, granted, I had a dhcp server in my house that fed the WAP11 an IP, gateway and DNS servers when it was plugged in, but I believe doing all that manually is not incredibly difficult.<br> <br>With the WAP11 sitting in my basement directly underneath the steel beam that supports the house, I still get four bars worth of signal in my bedroom two floors up, and three bars sitting at the end of my driveway.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
