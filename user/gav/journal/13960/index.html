<p>
Dear Mr. Estey:
</p>
<p>
After careful consideration of the circumstances surrounding your accident with our insured, we feel we have enough information to make a decision on your claim.
</p>
<p>
Our investigation determined Mr. XXXX intended to make a right hand turn and when he began that turn you pulled up along the right side of his vehicle causing our insured vehicle to come into contact with your vehicle. Your actions were the proximate cause of this accident.
</p>
<p>
We are only obliged to pay claims where our insured is legally liable for damages. It is our opinion that our insured was not legally liable for this accident and we respectfully decline any payment on your claim.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That just seems like fancy talk for "we don't don't think you'll bother suing us for $300". Bastards.</p></p>

<h2>Do you have uninsured motorist?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/phillup/">phillup</a> on 2003-08-07T00:02:17</h3>
I have uninsured motorist on my policy.<br> <br>I was rear-ended a few years ago and got something like that from the fella's insurance company.<br> <br>I called my insurance company up and pointed out to them that I had uninsured motorist coverage so that my vehicle would be fixed, no matter the state of the other person's insurance... and this seemed applicable to me.<br> <br>My insurance paid to fix the damage (minus my deductible) and then *they* sued for recovery... which got me back my deductible.<br> <br>Might be worth a shot if you have the coverage. (I got lucky...)
