<p><p>Today is going down as a sucky day:</p>
<ul>
<li>I went to do my taxes at H&R Block. I owe $5300 this year. I can't afford to pay that. On a plus side I am due back $1500 from last year as I accidentally forgot to file.</li>
<li>While leaving, I saw the nice traffic cops giving my car a ticket. I ran down the road to discover getting $6.50 fine. Even better, they are coming to tow my car as my cousin got a $57 fine back in August that she never told me about. I managed to convince them that just taking my money is enough punishment and towing was unnecessary.</li>
<li>When I fix my W-4 and pay the right amount of taxes I'll be taking home $300 less a month. Fantastic.</li>
<li>My rent went up $50 this month but I forgot.</li>
<li>I've lost my glasses. I'm getting a headache trying to focus on the screen.</li>
</ul>

<h2>schadenfreude</h2>

not in the complete sense of the word but just a little because I owe about $4,000 in federal taxes (have not done my state yet) and I can just barely afford it. The rest of your day just plain sucks.

The band <a href="http://www.12rods.com/" title="12rods.com">12 Rods</a 12rods.com> has a song that opens with "Today has sucked<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...".  It's called "Glad That It's Over" from their album Separation Anxieties.  You should listen to it sometime.  Maybe you'll feel better<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)



<h2>Tax stuff</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/kjones4/">kjones4</a> on 2003-03-13T03:09:35</h3>
The IRS is good about setting up a payment plan if you really can't afford to pay. They will almost always accept a payment plan if you owe less tan 10,000. Just make sure you file ontime and are honest with them. Make sure previous returns have been filed. So, get last years return filed (you'll get money back, but there is a small penalty for not filing ontime), and ask about a payment plan when you file this years return.
