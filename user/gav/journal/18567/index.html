<p><p>I got an <i>AdelphiaGRAM</i>:</p>
<blockquote><tt>ALL YOUR CABLE TELEVISION SERVICES WILL BE DISCONNECTED ON OR AFTER THU MAY 13, 2004. TO PREVENT DISCONNECTION, IMMEDIATE PAYMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF <b>-2.59</b> MUST BE PAID AT YOUR LOCAL OFFICE BY WED MAY 12, 2004.</tt></blockquote>
<p>After calling Adelphia, I found out that I didn't have to go visit them and pay $-2.59. You'd have thought that their automated billing system wouldn't send out bills to people who were owed money.</p></p>

<h2>Stupid billing systems</h2>

Near the end of my graduate school career, the finance office owed me 4 cents, and they sent me a check for it.  I kept the check in my desk drawer, along with the envelope with the 32 cent stamp on it.<br> <br>After 90 days, they sent me another check for 4 cents, because the other one had expired.  Again, another 32 cent stamp.<br> <br>This happened once more.  I was tempted to go to the cashier to demand my 4 cents, but then I would have to walk across campus.  I much preferred them to keep sending me the check.



<h2>zero dollars?</h2>

When I left my last job, my last paycheck was mailed to me, as most are.  But I opened it and it was for a whopping $0.00.  Gee, tell me what you *really* think of me...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)  Needless to say, the problem was resolved and I got my money, but it was an amusing process.

I don't know know about the law where you are, but here, if you give proper notice (or if you are let go<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:), your last paycheck is due on your last day.
