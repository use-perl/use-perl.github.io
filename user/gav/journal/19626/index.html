<p>
Well first off, what are you defining as a 'web designer'? this can range from a pure graphic designer to a template editing web monkey. Do you want to have freelance designer or someone on a contract/permenant basis? Is it even paid employment?
</p>
It's not an easy thing to hire anyone, but if you work out what exact role they need to fill, then you can look more easily at likely candidates.

I consider a "web designer" to be somebody that is able take a spec, design an appropriate page (or set of pages) using HTML and making accompanying graphics, while a "graphic designer" does the same for print.
<br> <br>
A template editing monkey is something entirely different and in this case would be me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<br> <br>
Sorry for not being clear on this, I was looking for a freelancer designer for paid work.

Rightio... next thing to ask is how much you'd be willing to pay and what quality you'd be looking for within that price range. I know plenty of people who charge around the GBP &#163;20 per hour mark, but that may be a little steep. Another possibility is freelancers.com or that kind of thing.

<h2>Graphic designer</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2004-07-01T19:00:30</h3>
Email me at autarch { AT } urth.org if you're looking for someone to do graphic design / HTML without any programming.  I have a couple friends who are good designers who do freelance work.  They can work with a templating system (along the lines of "don't touch those bits").



<h2>Finding a person to do X.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pjf/">pjf</a> on 2004-07-02T09:43:05</h3>
<p>
In most circumstances, the best way to find a person who does 'X' is by direct referral.  Go to your peers, let them know that you're after a web-designer, and do they know anyone they can recommended?  In posting to use.perl, you've done that in a virtual sense, which is excellent.
</p><p>
The big advantage of referral is that most individuals are unlikely to refer you to someone who they feel is a poor worker.  You're also more likely to get someone who's close to you, and share a number of common social and business ties.  All of those are good things.
 <p>
Local user-groups are an excellent starting point, as are professional organisations such as SAGE.
