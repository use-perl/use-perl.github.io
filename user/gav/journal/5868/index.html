<p>Ack! My back is hurting. I'm tired. This was supposed to be a restful weekend so that monday I could be nose to the grindstone on my current project.
<p>
Today I braved the crowds at K-Mart and got things to pretty up the flat. Our supposedly 'mildew proof' shower curtain had too much mildew on it for me to bear cleaning so I got a new one. I also got a huge can of scrubbing bubbles and sprayed about half of it over the bath. Things shine now.
<p>
I also got a nice Martha Stewart wok set as my $3.99 one is losing the non-stick black stuff. I shall be cooking some exciting chicken and mushoom combination in it later. It looks quite impressive for $29.99 (with a lid and some assorted wooden implements).  
<p>
I've decided that I've got fat over the last few months. Decided to remedy this I'll be joining the health club again (had to cancel my membership due to being so busy at work it wasn't worth the $80/mo). I think swimming every other morning sounds like a plan and it may wake me up enough so I can be productive before 10am.
<p>
The other bad thing is my lack of money. I've worked out that when I get my pay cheque at the end of the month and pay my bills the next day that's 40% of my take home gone. I'm sure that number is too high, it's not that I'm living extravagantly. It doesn't help a great deal that my housemate (my cousin) is jobless and I've had to foot the bill.
<p>
The good news is that I've just won a used 2U box on ebay; p3-450, 512mb and 3x9 gig scsi disks. It's a dual board so I just have to find another cpu and I'm laughing. Work is going to let me put it in their rack for free so I'm going to be able to manage my email and websites myself for the first time (which is pretty scary).
