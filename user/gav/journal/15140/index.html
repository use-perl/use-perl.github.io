<p>Moving to <a href="http://www.redhat.com/software/rhel/es/">Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES</a> at $349 a pop seems a good option as this will be supported for 5 years.</p>
<p>Is anyone else facing the same set of issues?</p></p>

I'm moving two clusters of 25 nodes each to 7.3 because our 7.2 distro is broken (we tweak RH to do our bidding so to speak).<br> <br>I'll be doing some testing on some nodes to make sure 9 will work ok.<br> <br>All the other Linux boxen will be going to RH9 if they aren't already. Really a pain but it beats paying an arm and a leg for an OS. Not sure why we don't use Debian, the guy that started it did go to school here after all...

I've recently been faced with a similar problem, "What distro to move to for a new installation?" I've narrowed it down to the ~ $400 Redhat Enterprise and Suse's newest enterprise product at a similar price. The main attraction of the Redhat product is a guarantee of 5 years of security/bug fixes as long as my friend is willing to fork out $89 a year for the Redhat network. I just started looking at the Suse product and the web-based admin tools look very nice. I suppose webmin would be just as good, but I don't know for sure. The apt system of Debian is nice for the more advanced user, but there are complications with selectively upgrading only portions of the system, so I don't think my friend really wants to deal with that. He'd rather pay for a point and clicky sort of update system. I haven't decided which way to go. Any thoughts on this?

If it's for the desktop, <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/" title="redhat.com">Fedora</a redhat.com> (what will be the free Red Hat) looks promising, with a first release November 3rd. I'll probably be putting this on my home Linux box when it comes out.

Nearly 800 boxes running Red Hat. It's taken us several months to upgrade to 8.0 (from 6.2, which was already EOL). I think we're looking at two options now: roll our own RPMs or switch distros completely. I'm sure RH would love us to by their Enterprise version, but it's just not cost effective for us.

I'm thinking that there is a good opportunity for a 3rd party to keep making errata RPMs for the last couple of Red Hat versions. I'm sure there would be interest in something like this if it was reasonably priced.

<p>I think <a href="http://www.tummy.com/krud/" title="tummy.com">KRUD</a tummy.com> does this.</p>
