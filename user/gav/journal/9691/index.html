<p>I went to the shops last night to buy essentials; milk, rice krispies, nyquil, and shampoo. When I got home I couldn't unlock the door, the key wouldn't turn at all. Luckily Nate saved the day and I crashed at his house.
<p>
I know I can get back in the house as a window is open. The only problem is that I'm on the 1st floor.
This morning I can't get hold of my landlord so I go to my apartments anyway to see if the maintanance guy comes so I can borrow a ladder from him. No show. Then somebody shows up in a truck with 2 ladders on top. Yay! I cry, and give chase. 
<p>
Me: "I'm locked out of my apartment, can I borrow you ladder to get in?"
<br>Him: "No"
<br>Me: "It's just round the corner" *points*
<br>Him: "No"
<br>Me: "Why?"
<br>Him: "If you fall I would be liable"
<br>Me: "Thank you very fucking much. When they are giving out good samaritan awards I'll be sure to mention your name"
<p>
I walked to the payphone and called Tony who came to my rescue with a ladder. It was a little short, and rickety, and on muddy ground but he made it through my window to save the day.
<p>
I took my lock apart and put it back together and it seems to work. I'm just not sure how much trust it now...

I was going to mutter that Australia also uses $[ == 0.<br> <br>Then I realised it varies. Some buildings do, some don't. At my university, the engineering and CS buildings started on 1; the arts and laws ones start at 0. One of the libraries appears to start at 2 (the most common entrance is ground level, just not the ground the library is built on).<br> <br>Actually, one of the malls here, you walk in on the ground, go up a flight of escalators (or in a lift if you're lazy), keep walking and end up walking out on the ground. The joy of hills. Confuses those using the lift.
