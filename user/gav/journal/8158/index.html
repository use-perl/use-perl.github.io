<p>Today started badly. I sat down on my chair and one wheel snapped and I almost ended up smashing my face into the desk but instead fell arse first on the ground. 
<p>
I decided a bit of shopping therapy was in order and bought a pair of Sennheiser <a href="http://www.sennheiser.com/sennheiser/icm_eng.nsf/root/products_headphones_homeuse_cordlessheadphones_04953">wireless headphones</a>. I needed a new pair anyway at work as last week I rolled back to talk to somebody, forgot I was wearing them and ended up snapping them.
<p>
I also found out that it costs about 15 cents a foot to develop 16mm film, which works out at about $15 for a 4-minute shot. I think I will have to develop a frugal filming style to afford this new hobby. I've been bidding on a Krasnogorsk-3 camera from Ebay and have ordered a couple of books from Amazon on the subject.
<p>
Yahoo decided to make my day interesting. There is a field in Yahoo Store called 'softgood' which isn't used for anything. We often use it to load some extra data. One of our clients has had a problem where products (seemingly at random) were marked as gift certificates and would screw up the ordering process. It turns out that all these items had something loaded into the 'softgood' field beginning with 'c'. Technical support told me that we shouldn't have been using the field anyway. I can't see why they would make a change to do something so strange. That's one of the problems with Yahoo, if they change something and it breaks, it's not a "bug" it's something you have to work around. It can be very frustrating.
