<p><p>Verizon have a new profit increasing tactic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cancel DSL but still charge for it. Claim it takes 3 months for the money you paid for a service you didn't get to be refunded.</li>
<li>Give a free dial-up account that costs $19.99/month.</li>
<li>Don't hire enough operators to answer the phone so that it takes 20 minutes waiting on hold to get through. Encourage people to email questions but then tell them their question can only be answered over the phone.</li>
<li>Get people to sign up for automatic payments so you can get the money you think they owe before they get to see the bill.</li>

<h2>A Page Borrowed From AOL</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chaoticset/">chaoticset</a> on 2004-01-05T18:03:07</h3>
I've never managed to successfully quit AOL the two times I tried, either.  AOL literally broke the checking account in one case.  (The second time wasn't my fault, honest.  Laura wanted AOL for some inscrutable reason, and set up a free trial.)



<h2>They do eventually fix things</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/kag/">kag</a> on 2004-01-05T18:29:07</h3>
In June, they offered me a new rate for DSL.  The June and July charges to my credit card were a mess due to partial months.  August was $7 high.  Call in early September (when the CC bill arrived) to get fixed.  (<i>the surprising part</i>)  I got in touch with Billing after only a few minutes on hold, and they quickly agreed that they were mischarging me (for dialup access, even though I indicated I no longer wanted it if it wasn't free).  But they'd already billed me for September.  So a credit would appear in October.  November, the charge is finally correct.<br> <br>Now I just have to keep an eye on it...<br>
