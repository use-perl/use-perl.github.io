<div class="span8">
<p>I'm off on holiday on the 13th so I thought it would be nice to order some books from Amazon so I have plenty to read on the beach. I made two orders, mainly as I decided I wanted a Maui guide book, which I couldn't add to my first order (even though it hadn't shipped), and I added a couple more items to bump it to $25 to get free shipping which wasn't quick enough anyway.
<p>
December 28th: Approx $100 order. The one part I wasn't in a hurry about shipped on the 30th but they didn't give me a tracking number so I have no idea when it will come. I kept checking back everyday to see when things would ship, everything was marked "Usually ships in 24 hours", and Amazon emailed me to let me know that one of the books was being delayed (changed from "24 hours" to "24 hours"!) so I paid even more to upgrade to 2-day and split the package. According to UPS, Amazon shipped it on the 13th December 2000 (!) and they got it on Jan 4th 2003. Amazon claim it will be delivered Jan 8-Jan 14th, which seems pretty crappy for 2-day, which shouldn't by definition arrive in 2 (business) days?
<p>
December 31st: $31.45 items, plus $12.96 for 2 day shipping. I had to change it from Ground to 2-day (estimated Jan 3rd-Jan 4th) as the delivery estimate was Jan 8th-Jan 15th and I didn't want to risk it. I paid for 2-day, but it's the 5th now and the package is still in NH, hopefully that will mean it will be delivered by Wednesday.
<p>
The moral of the story? It would have been a hell of a lot easier (and cheaper) to go to my local Borders (or B&N) and just buy them there. I'm just used to buying things from Amazon. The other thing is, if the books don't come by friday, I'm going to go to the bookshop anyway so I'm not caught bookless.</p>

Good idea. Slightly edited story on the way to them. I wonder what the response will be...
