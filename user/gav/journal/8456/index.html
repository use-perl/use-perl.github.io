<p>I quite liked the idea of <a href=" http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=02/10/14/1454253&mode=thread&tid=9">Mark-Jason Dominus'</a> Perl quiz of the week; I'm using it to start some team coding/reviewing here at work. I passed the two questions out and on Monday we're going to review everyone's (3 of us) solution and discuss things over pizza (my boss' contribution). I'll report back on how it went.
<p>
In other news I've given up on Redhat 8 for my new server. The Perl that it ships with doesn't want to work with new XS based modules (Compress::Zlib for example) and I couldn't build my own version of Perl from source as it failed a couple of tests. I think this might be related to some kind of Unicode or Locale issue. The RH 8 console prints screwy characters in "man", which just smacks of a lack of testing. I'm going to install RH 7.3 instead.

<h2>Perl 5.8 tests</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2002-10-18T18:47:50</h3>
On my Solaris 9 box, the lib/Config test went into some sort of endless loop which resulted in an "out of memory!" error.  I just skipped the tests and installed it anyway.
<p>
My point is, I think the tests themselves may be broken.</p>

IIRC, lib/Config.t was added in the test suite just a few weeks before the release of 5.8.0. Thus it wasn't extensively tested&nbsp;; -- however I didn't heard about this kind of failure. If some tests are broken (reproducibly broken, it may be sensitive to the load of your system or to other parameters) you may want to help to fix them.

<h2>man fucked in RH8</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2002-10-18T22:18:18</h3>
It's intentional.  If you want it fixed, do "export LESS=-R".  See the <a href="http://groff.ffii.org/#grotty" title="ffii.org">release notes</a ffii.org> for the latest groff.

<p>At some point, I <i>will</i> figure out why this doesn't happen by default.

</p><p>And of course, it's all locales causing the problems at the heart of it all.  I could actually care less, but the fucking things break the sort order of ls.  How crap is that?

Somehow:
<blockquote><div>export LANG="POSIX"</div></blockquote>
fixes it too
<p>
My fix was a little more drastic. I am installing 7.3<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
