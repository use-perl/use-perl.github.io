<p><p>I'm having a little landscaping done because the place looked a bit of a disaster. They came with a Bobcat today and leveled the front garden a bit and dumped a bunch of topsoil about. I have flower-beds which will soon contain actual flowers. It's quite exciting.</p>
<p>The mailboxes for this end of the street are on the edge of my property. They decided to pick them up and move them so they wouldn't be in the way. My neighbors were a bit upset about this and within 15 minutes about 10 people complained to the Post Office (what are all these people doing in the middle of the day?). The Post Office sent somebody round to see if we were going to put the mailboxes back but didn't seem too bothered. Then when I got home the Postmistress came to visit. She turned out to be a very nice lady. I think they prefer that you ask before you go near mailboxes with forklifts.</p>

<h2>topsoil</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mary.poppins/">mary.poppins</a> on 2004-05-22T08:40:24</h3>
Composted kitchen scraps are great for making super-rich<br>topsoil.  Here's the recipe:  Accumulate leaves, grass<br>clippings, and kitchen veggie scraps in a pile.  Add new<br>stuff in the center.  If it gets really dry, add water.<br>Stir occasionally.<br> <br>It's really easy.  Just don't put in sticks; they take<br>forever to decompose unless you actually put some effort in.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>



<h2>City owned</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/KM/">KM</a> on 2004-05-22T23:34:53</h3>
Actually, the city usually owns between 5 and 10 feet of easement from a street into a property. This allows them to make sidewalks, put up mailboxes, dig sewers, plow snow and do other things without having to ask you.<br/><br/>I was at my town hall last week talking with someone while getting mosquito dunks and he was talking about that. He said some guy was being a real jerk, calling the town and telling them that he wants them to replant the grass that the snow piles killed in his yard. He said he told the guy "We won't replant the grass, and we won't allow you to do it either."<br/><br/>Don't mess with the city<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) But, messing with neighbors is ok.
