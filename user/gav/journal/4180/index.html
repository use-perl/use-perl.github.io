<p>The last few weeks I've wondered what it would be like to be married and have kids. As half the people at work are I feel left out. Maybe I'm having some sort of hormonal imbalance or something, I shouldn't feel broody should I? <p>The thought of commitment, kids, and mortgages scare me so I don't think it is going to happen soon (especially due to my lack of a significant other).
<p>Hmm... me as a dad, I can't see that working... /me wanders off for more beerage
<p>
p.s. I apologise for the drunken pointless update, normal ranting will continue tommorow.</p>

As it is probably a key thing in this jumbled rant, I forgot to mention that I'm going to be celebrating my 23rd birthday in ~6 weeks. I feel older though. I think I look older too, starting to shed hair at 18 does that to a guy<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Also I've now got no exciting birthdays (like 16/18/21) left until I'm 40. Well I guess that gives me a while to plan. Maybe I should form paragraphs without using the word 'guess'.

<p>The way you talk, I thought you were 30 or 40!  Cheer up; I just turned 24.  Got a mortgage, but no sigoth or kids etc.  People like you and me are two young to be married and have kids.  (Grin when you say that to your coworkers.)</p>

<p>"too" young.  I'm not usually this stupid; only when I'm in front of a screen.  Oh, wait...</p>
