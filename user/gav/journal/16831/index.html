<p><p>It seems that every time I have to deal with customer support it turns into some painful saga.</p>
<p>I'm expecting a package shipped to my house via UPS to arrive Tuesday. I've been tracking the package to see where it was. Tuesday they attempted to deliver the package but claimed the address was invalid and had to be corrected. They attempted again today but the package was refused, which I found odd because nobody was home to refuse it. I called up the nice folks at UPS and found that they "corrected" my address from "1 Porterwood Drive" to "543 Porterwood Drive" because that's what the computer said to do. Why nobody thought this was odd is beyond me, especially as they've delivered a couple of packages to me since I've moved here. I confirm my address, give directions in case finding the first house on the road is too difficult, and ask that they leave it on my deck because I won't be in. Like normal people I'm not in during the times when UPS deliver. I get home and find a message on the machine saying that the driver won't leave the package on my deck because he feels it's not safe enough. I have to call back and reschedule the delivery for Friday at work.</p>

The sounds about right for UPS.<br> <br>They ended up returning two different packages that were meant to go to my home address within a couple of days of each other. Why? Apparently their computer told them to deliver the packages to an office I worked in over two years ago (that I guess I must have had a package redirected to at some point). The company I worked for doesn't even occupy that office anymore. And here's the kicker: This was without even attempting a delivery to my home. Yay smart!



<h2>crapwitted delivery services</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rjbs/">rjbs</a> on 2004-01-15T10:06:38</h3>
All the delivery companies are, as far as I can tell, crap.<br/><br/>UPS does the sort of thing you said.  Also, they tend to happily deliver to unsafe locations, but never to good ones.<br/><br/>http://rjbs.manxome.org/debug/entry/2003-09-15 and following tell the story of my amazing ordeal with getting my iPod delivered.  In the end, it was only luck that I managed to get it.<br/><br/>I ordered office supplies before my current business trip, to be delivered to my home, and they went to the office, despite the address on the box --- and the fact that I was sitting around waiting for them.<br/><br/>Is there a<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/good/ delivery service that I don't know about?  What will it take to get major businesses to use it?

just opt to pick it up at their distro center. It may be
out of the way and inconvenient but at least I get
packages.
