<p><p>The fun with Verizon continues. I can't login to the dialup number they gave me.</p>

<p>V: This is the Verizon automated system, I can understand what you say. Please enter your phone number
<br />M: XXX-XXX-XXX
<br />V: What is the problem?
<br />M: I can't log in
<br />V: I'm sorry you can't get your email. You can find help on www.verizon.com
<br />M: Arrrgh 
</p>

<p>[ hang up, call again, finally get a human ]</p>
 
<p>V: What's your phone number?
<br />M: XXX-XXX-XXXX
<br />V: Business or residential?
<br />M: Residential
<br />V: What's the problem?
<br />M: I can't log in with my username and password
<br />V: Is this DSL or dialup?
<br />M: Dialup 
<br />V: Sorry this is the DSL technical support number, let me transfer you to dialup
<br />M: Ok
</p>

<p>[ and the buck is passed again... ]</p>

<p>V: What's your phone number?
<br />M: XXX-XXX-XXXX
<br />V: Business or residential?
<br />M: Residential
<br />V: What's the problem?
<br />M: I can't login
<br />V: You don't have a dialup account
<br />M: I should do, when you guys helpfully turned off my DSL you set up a free dialup account for me. I was even given the number to call.
<br />V: You need to speak to billing...
</p>

<p>[ annoying call music ]</p>

<p>V: Can I confirm that your DSL number is XXX-XXX-XXX
<br />M: (nearly dies of shock) Yes
<br />V: What's the problem?
<br />M: I can't log in. Tech support says that the free diaup you set up for me doesn't exist.
<br />V: It doesn't start until Monday
<br />M: But you disconnected me last Monday!
<br />V: Yes but it says Monday in the system and I can't change that.
<br />M: But you're a technology company!  Surely you can move the date forward 3 days?
<br />V: I can't do anything, it's set up by your local branch and it will work Monday.
<br />M: Can I speak to your supervisor?
<br />V: They're all busy and wouldn't be able to get back to you tonight. And they couldn't change the date anyway.
<br />M: So you can't do anything?
<br />V: I can not charge you for the week you haven't had DSL.
<br />M: That's mighty kind of you.
</p>

<p>[ awkward silence while we wait for system to accept changes ]</p>

<p>V: All done. My role is to provide excellent customer service, have I done this for you today?
<br />M: Well you've done your best but your company has provided piss poor service.
<br />V: I'm sorry

<h2>Verizon sucks so much... it's a black hole</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/neuroball/">neuroball</a> on 2003-11-22T04:49:29</h3>
Gav, sorry to hear about your pains... <br>
<br>
If I would have paid attention a bit earlier I might have been able to help you. Until today I worked for Verizon Online... the people who build the web pages for a big part of Verizon.<br>
<br>
A. Verizon sucks, especially for you, because you live in a GPS state. What is a GPS state? A state that is neither clearly east nor west. (Verizon was founded by a merger of BellA (e) and GTE (w)).<br>
<br>
Because of restrictions between this former companies some customers location (east or west) can just be found out through the phone number).<br>
<br>
Now to the Dial-In Numbers: I hope that you are an east customer... than one of my legacy applications could help you.<br>
<br>
Go to: http://www.verizon.net/pands/dial/availability.asp and choose DELAWARE as state of your choice. You will then get the Dial in number screen asking for your area code and prefix.<br>
<br>
wish you all the best.../oliver/
