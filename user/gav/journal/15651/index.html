<p><p>I've been merrily going along writing screen scrapers for all my bank accounts and credit cards but I've hit a major road block. I can't get anything to connect to Capital One.</p>
<p>I've tried LWP (both with Crypt::SSLeay and IO::Socket::SSL), w3m, links, curl, and wget. It works fine on Internet Explorer and Netscape but that's not much help for screen scraping from my linux box. I'm faking my user-agent string so I'm guessing that it's looking for something in the SSL handshake.</p>
<p>I don't know enough to work out what's going wrong so I'm going to offer a $20 reward (and my eternal gratitude) to the first person who can help me get LWP working with this site*.</p>

<h2>No Safari, but IE4!</h2>

They say Safari isn't compliant when going to that page. I guess they don't like Safari's 128-bit encryption, or just don't care about us Mac users.<br> <br>They suggest:<br> <br>"We suggest Netscape version 4.08 or higher or Internet Explorer version 4.0 or higher. For Macintosh users, we suggest Internet Explorer version 4.5 or higher."<br> <br>But, I like this:<br> <br>"We regret any inconvenience this may cause but, with these policies, we strive to keep your account information as secure as possible."<br> <br>Yet, they suggest you use IE version *4* or higher. VERSION FOUR.. ON WINDOWS! How is this making sure your info is as secure as possible? They don't care if you are on a broadband connection and not using a firewall. They don't care if you have all your files shared to the world. They don't care if you are using an unpatched M$ product (or OS) which is vulnerable to known trojans/works/virii. They don't care if you have have your account info on a Post It on your monitor. I don't use them, but I'd wonder if they email you your password at any time unencrypted (on account activation or a "forgot your password" thing). Heck, even IE on Mac (OS X) is at 5.2 or so with some security patches.<br> <br>Yet.. they strive to make sure your account info is as secure as possible by saying you can access the site using IE 4 or higher (meaning, IE 4 is good enough to keep you secure). Every one of my banks is compatible with Safari, so I'm curious why Capital One thinks (or chooses) Safari is not combatible with their online banking system.<br> <br>Something else that was interesting is that when you go to the front page, and click 'register', it seems to want to take you through the online registration just fine. No mention of the browser being used not being compatible with their system. Plus, if you go to the FAQ you only see info on your browser needing 128-bit encryption.. nothing about not being able to use Safari (or any other popular browser). So, I guess you could just find this all out by registering, then trying to log in.<br> <br>Sorry.. this doesn't help you with your problem<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) I'm just curious what they have against Safari. I assume your attempts to login get you a page with the message I saw.

<p>Looks that way, I just got this email back from them:</p>
<blockquote><div>
Thank you for contacting Capital One.  We appreciate the opportunity to
review your recent inquiry.
<br> <br>
We regret, we do not currently support the Safari browser.  Please check
our website periodically for additional information.
<br> <br>
We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.

So.. why do they let you register while using Safari?? The first page of their 'registration' should say "You can register with your browser, however it isn't supported with the ONLINE BANKING YOU ARE REGISTERING FOR!"<br> <br>Crap like that ticks me off.
