<p><p>I have a credit score that sucks ass. The only part of it that is my fault is the lack of time I've been in the US. One of the things that pisses me off most is the Capital One adverts on the TV, the no-hassles card that has all these nice features and a low 9.9% APR. I don't have a fucking no-hassle card, I have the version for people with bad credit, the full-of-fucking-hassle-card. I have to pay 19.8% with a credit limit of $200. What makes this even worse is that they have $100 of my money to secure it. </p>

<p>Anyway, the plot thickens. I got not one, but two letters from them in the last month. They want to give me a new credit card. Rejoice! They are going to thank me for being a good customer for 18 months and extend my credit. I have my "Priority Notification" and it says:</p>

<blockquote><i>You have built up a good relationship with us. As a result, you are Confirmed for an additional credit card offer- a new Capital One Platinum MasterCard with a credit line up to $2,000 and a low 14.9% fixed APR.</i></blockquote>

<p>(spot the capital 'C' in Confirmed)</p>

<p>I rush onto the internet and apply online. I'm only 15 business days from having a credit card with enough credit to buy something on it.</p>

<p>Of course stories in real-life never have such a happy ending.  I'm  declined for my new card. I have insufficient credit history, blah, blah. Capital One should know this, they know I had no credit history 18 months ago, and I'm pretty sure they would be aware that I would have cancelled my crappy $200 limit card approximatly 30 seconds after I had a credit history. Not only do I not have a shiny new Platinum card, but my crappy credit limit is probably even lower with this added rejection.</p></p>
