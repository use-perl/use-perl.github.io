<p><p>About a week ago the raid-1 partition on my linux box (RH 9) went tits up, I had screens full of DMA errors and one of the two disks was toast. I thought the problem was a bad (or too long, it was 24") cable and that the second disk was really ok. I swapped out the cable hoping this would fix things. No luck, adding it back into the raid set would just give DMA errors (bad CRCs mainly).</p><p>It's an IBM (Hitachi) Deskstar and less than a year old so I ran the drive fitness tests today hoping it would fail so I could RMA it. This reports that there are no errors. Now when I try to reboot it with the drive plugged in I get the same bunch of errors and the boot grinds to a halt and dies trying to re-initialize the controller. It did work fine and I've got no clue what could be causing the problem. Any ideas? The only thing I can think of is that the PCI ATA-66 card is fried but that seems unlikely to me as my main drive is connected to it.</p></p>
