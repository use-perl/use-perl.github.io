<p><p>My iBook took a 4 foot plunge from the counter to the floor with the screen open. The battery fell out and the end of the power connector got a bit bent but everything seems fine. Considering the amount of damage this poor iBook has taken, it's a testament to Apple's good engineering. </p></p>

Just before OSCON mine took a plunge off the couch right onto the power connector.  It, too, seemed ok with the power connector just a little bent out of shape.  About a week later the logic board failed.  The logic board had failed twice before, so this may have be a coincidence but when the Knowledgable Guy at CMU Repair saw the state of my plug he hypothesized that it might cause some power flucuations and fry the logic board.  When I sent it back to Apple they replaced both the power and logic boards.  Its worth getting it checked out.

The problem is that I don't have AppleCare so I don't have a better option than just crossing my fingers and hoping it doesn't go wrong. It's been a week now so I'm hoping it's ok...
