<p>I've been doing a bit of javascript hacking the last few days and I'm ashamed to say, I've been enjoying it :)
<p>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596000480/">JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</a> is a great book and it's 
helped me get my head around the W3 DOM stuff. 
Most of the sites I work with are <a href="http://store.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Stores</a>
which means that you are basically working with
static pages. I've worked out how to do some
little tricks which have enabled us to do somethings we didn't think possible.
<p>
Today I worked on a little script that parses the shopping cart page so we can know what the visitor has got in it. This means we can do some neat things that you take for granted if the cart was yours.
<p>
The best thing is, all this stuff seems to work on most browsers (IE 5+, Mozilla, NS 6+). The only downside is that IE on the Mac doesn't work nearly as well as the Windows version. This was a bit frustrating, especially as one site I've been working on is for a client who only have Macs.
<p>
On other news, I've been starting to use <a href="http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/">RT</a> more. I've started by pestering my boss into adding all my tasks into it :) </p>
