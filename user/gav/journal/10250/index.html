It's a little after 6am (Tuesday) and I'm writing this from Washington as I wait for my connection back to Burlington. I've had a fantasic two weeks in Maui and I'm somewhat sad to be returning. It's cold and dark out, Maui was a loverly 60-90F and it's a little odd to be wearing a jumper (sweater) again.  

</p>

<p>

I managed to get a good deal of reading. I'm a sit on the beach and read kind of person, I don't know how those people can just sit there and sunbathe. I burn too easily anyway. I also did quite a bit of movie watching thanks to my iBook and NetFlix (I changed my membership so I could take 8 DVDs with me).

</p>

<p>

Anyway, I was going to go write more but I'm too tired. I need coffee. Somebody should go and invent something that can read my mind so I don't have to type my thoughts. Then you could read about how I hate the 757-200 and how glad I am to have got a 777 back. I think the idea of spending at least a couple of weeks next January (to escape the brutal VT weather) back in Maui is a very good one indeed.

I am reading Wizardborn by David Farland... is there really two books of the same name?

Good catch, thanks<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br/><br/>The Runelord series is quite promising, I wonder when the next one will be out.
