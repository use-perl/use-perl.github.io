<p>One of the things I like most about the journals on use.perl is that I read something interesting and keep it tucked away in the back of my mind. I've just had a cunning idea about pipelines (I may be stealing what OpenFrame does, I must download and investigate).
<p>
Basically what I'm thinking is:
<ul>
<li>input <li> data <li> add template burners to pipeline
<li>call $burner->process() on each one
<li>output results
</ul>

I'm not suggesting that this is the most revolutionary or interesting thing, but it seems exactly what kind of design will best fit my latest project.

<p>

I'm working on what we like to call the 'editor'. It's a tool that allows clients to basically work on and modify services they have. At the moment it is a scary 11k lines of perl. It doesn't use templates and most of the client code is stuck in the single .pl file. I'm trying to work out a nice solution that uses templates and is more modular.

<p>

I also did a bit of thinking today about patterns. Basically I'm not sure if this whole pattern business is any cop. I'd rather think about the problem and try to think of a solution rather than  trying to fit a solution to the problem. It seems like banging square blocks into round holes. Sure you can get it in but you end up having to use a big hammer.</p>

<h2>Pipelines</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/james/">james</a> on 2002-08-15T08:40:33</h3>
Check out OpenFrame, it should do pretty much what you want (esp. 3.00).  If it doesn't at least have a look at the Pipeline module -- its designed so that through judicious use of subclassing all sorts of Pipelines can be plugged together, even if the Pipeline segments are not plug-compatible.<br> <br>If you're interested, pop on to #openframe on rhizo and have a chat with us, we're on there most of the time (i.e. unless we're asleep and we'll be happy to help out).<br> <br>Cheers,<br>James.<br>
