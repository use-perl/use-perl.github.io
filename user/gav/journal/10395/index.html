I would really like a Canon EOS 3 with the 28-135mm USM IS lens; all I need to do is work out how to scrape together $1200. I have been putting off buying a new camera for a while now because digital has tempted me but I just like 35mm too much. The last straw with my Pentax SLR was my Hawaii pictures where there were too many shots that the exposure wasn't quite right.
</p>
<p>
I paid my insurance finally today, though I couldn't do it over the web because they had set a new maximum password length of 8 and this was rejecting my 9 character password. I had to resort to human contact and pay over the phone. They are going to try to change my payment date to a more sensible 10th of the month, which is nice of them.
</p>
<p>
I'm going to be in LA on the 25th for a week. My boss OK'd me to go to <a href="http://www.yapc.org/America/">YAPC NA</a> in Boca Raton, my ever Perl conference. Yay!
</p>

Might want to check out the 7e.  Probably a decent chance you could get a used 7e + 28-135is lens on ebay for about $600.  Half the price and 90% of the capabilities (IMHO).<br/><br/>--John C

Thanks. The 7E is about $500 new for the body vs $800 for the 3. I'm more tempted by the 7E now I've looked at it a bit, the thing that I like is a on-camera flash, handy for emergencies and simple fill-in.<br> <br>I think I'll get a 7E until I can afford a 1V and a speedlite<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
