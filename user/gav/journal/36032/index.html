Well, to get the letter from Tim's lawyers, you'd have to excerpt from the essay and not just the copyright notice. You'd have to quote something like "The fact that it&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s thousands of pages long really isn&#226;&#8364;&#8482;t that much of a usability problem", then have some sort of transformative effect like saying "Tim is deluded if he thinks thousands of pages is a usability problem, since I know that I can't get most people to read a 300 page book on learning Perl". You might also quote "There&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s a decent chance that the publication of OOXML will help build an open ecosystem for people who want to write tools to read and write office documents, which would be good for the world and Microsoft too", and note that "never in my experience has anything that benefited Microsoft benefited the world".<br><br>You also have to leave off the link to his essay. You didn't violate his rules because you linked to the essay. You can cherry-pick as long as you link, apparently.

<p>I think Tim Bray&#8217;s &#8220;I&#8217;ll pull out the lawyers&#8221; is lame.</p>

<p>But at the same time, the spirit in which he meant the threat (&#8220;it&#8217;s abuse to cherry-pick this to serve your agenda if you prevent your readers from getting the full picture&#8221;) seems obvious and reasonable to me. So all the people skreaking and bouncing like chimps at the mere mention of lawyers look equally lame to me.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the point: he wants readers to have the link, so he&#8217;s threatening writers/journalists who quote selectively without linking. His threat is toothless, of course, but I certainly understand what compelled him to include it, considering how highly political the subject matter is.</p>

<p>Pointing out that he&#8217;s wrong merely makes you somewhat of a lawyeristic nitpicker (which won&#8217;t make me think less of you than I think of him for posturing with lawsuit threats); actually disrespecting his request and then mocking him, however, makes you a rowdy 15 year old. Have a bit more maturity than that.</p>

<p>What I said wasn't intended to sound mocking.  I just don't think like he thinks at all.  He and I see the burden of making people understand as falling in such completely different places that his request seems absolutely unreasonable and completely unworthy of respect to me.</p>

<p><div class="quote">His threat is toothless, of course<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... Pointing out that he's wrong merely makes you somewhat of a lawyeristic nitpicker</div> Well, aside from the fact that you just called youself a lawyerlistic nitpicker (sounds like a demon from the Mountains of Ignorance, cf. The Phantom Tollbooth), I think there's nothing whatsoever wrong with pointing out the fact that he is wrong.  Is not truth of its own value?<p><div class="quote">actually disrespecting his request and then mocking him, however, makes you a rowdy 15 year old</div> Nonsense.  If we pretend that he has a right to enforce that request for the sake of "maturity," then at some point he might.  I firmly believe that all unwarranted assertions of restrictions of liberty should be met by expression of precisely that liberty.  If someone says you cannot depict Muhammed, then you should do precisely that.  If someone says you cannot own a gun, you should buy one.  If someone says you must let in the police without a warrant, you should refuse.  This is how liberty is protected in the long run.<br><br>

<p>Yes, there is nothing wrong with purposefully misquoting someone who is writing about highly politicised matter and therefore asking to be quoted only in a particular fashion&#8230; because the request was accompanied by a toothless &#8220;or else.&#8221; And the right approach to life that will ensure you life in freedom is to maximally spite everyone who makes an unreasonable request.</p>

<p><div class="quote">Yes, there is nothing wrong with purposefully misquoting someone</div> See, again with the straw man.  No one did that.<p><div class="quote">asking to be quoted only in a particular fashion</div> Nope.  Let's be honest here, please.  He was demanding that we give up our rights, under threat of legal action, not merely asking.<p><div class="quote">And the right approach to life that will ensure you life in freedom is to maximally spite everyone who makes an unreasonable request.</div> Nope.  Not maximally, only enough to make the point, and only when rights are at issue.<p><div class="quote">Respect.</div> Exactly.  I respect the liberty of all people, including those that come after us, enough to fight for it whenever necessary.  And the most insidious way we lose our rights is when we voluntarily do it because someone else just thinks we should for some made-up and illogical sense of "decorum" or "maturity."<br><br>You and Tim Bray do not respect liberty much -- obviously, since you take such great pains to say he isn't saying precisely what he is saying, and what he emphasizes he is saying -- so you don't see this as valuable.

You are saying that defying his bullying is "immature."<br><br>He doesn't have to actually go through with his threat to disrespect liberty: simply making it is enough.

<p>If I had something to say about Tim Bray&#8217;s actual subject matter, I would have summarily quoted from his posting without feeling the need to either comply by his terms or to comment on my disregard thereof &#8211; but last I checked, none of those who I saw commenting on his posting had anything to say about what it was actually about.</p>

<p>I am asserting that it should be obvious that these commenters are therefore automatically outside of the group of people for whom Tim Bray would even consider making good on his threat. It follows that none of them have demonstrated anything interesting about the regard or alleged lack thereof for liberties that Mr. Bray may or may not have. All the short-breathed, red-faced posturing over liberties has done nothing more than make the commenters look ignorant of either the context, their own insignificance, or both.</p>

<p>How it follows from my expressing this observation that I disregard liberties is a mystery that only Chris Nandor can fathom.</p>

You're the pot calling the silverware black.<p><div class="quote">How it follows from my expressing this observation that I disregard liberties is a mystery that only Chris Nandor can fathom.</div> So you are incapable of reading, then?  I never said you disregard liberty, I said you disrespect it, and I explained how quite clearly, and that you refused to directly address it shows that you are either illiterate ot dishonest.  I shall unnecessarily repeat myself: you explicitly rejected the notion that giving in to unwarranted assertions of limitations of our liberty harms our liberty.  Indeed, you claimed that NOT giving in constitutes "immaturity."  It goes without saying -- for rational people -- that not respecting liberty enough to defend, and even OPPOSING such defenses of liberty, is a de facto disrespect of liberty.<br><br>What's more of a mystery is why you keep digging your hole deeper.<br>

<p>Digging myself in deeper? I wish! That would muffle the droning diatribe.</p>

<p>I explicitly reject the notion that refusing to give in to a limitation someone posted on his blog about what you may or may not do with his words on yours, when their limitation was obviously toothless to begin with and you have nothing else to do than yammer about the limitation itself, does damn-all for liberty. Also, I explicitly hold that failing to recognise this and pretending that challenging response does any great things for liberty makes you look like a self-important fool.</p>

<p>That is what I did and do.</p>

<p>Yes, I did that. It wasn&#8217;t stated that well, initially, but you took from there and managed to mangle those statements beyond all recognition, multiple times over. I have little doubt your next reply will be another iteration of the same.</p>
