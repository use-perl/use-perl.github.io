<p>I came across <a href="http://www.spidereyeballs.com/os5/perl/small_index.html">Extra Strength Perl</a> which contains pictures of perl people from OSCON 2001. It's quite nice to be able to put a face to a name :)<p>
<p>
I also spotted <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2002/06/20/skimpy.html">Skimpy Forum: An Application of Perl and XML</a>. I have always has the issue with XML that it seems interesting but there were very few examples of simple but useful XML/Perl applications (I think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735711143/">Perl for the Web</a> by Chris Radcliff does well in this regard).
<p>
The thing I take issue to is the <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/onlamp/2002/06/20/examples/example1.html">code</a> which I feel is a bad example of perl programming. It does these things which I consider <u>bad</u>:
<ol>
<li>Has a monolithic if-elsif-else controlling block rather than using a hash of code refs as a dispatch table.</li>
<li>The #1 offence you can commit, not using CGI.pm.</li>
<li>Embedding HTML in a perl script. Come on, this is 2002!</li>
</ol>
<p>
On other news I woke up this morning and had a thought (which is an exciting event in itself, any thinking before 10am is rare) that we need a good equivalent to <a href="http://www.cgi-resources.com/">The CGI Resource Index</a> which has an impressive collection of 2997 perl scripts. Instead of going for quantity I would rather have 300 listed that were considered of high quality by the community and showcased things such as Bricolage, AxKit, Template Toolkit, OpenInteract, Slashcode, etc. In the past I've rolled my own scripts because I haven't had the mental strength to search through the mire of shite that is out there. Any comments?</p>
