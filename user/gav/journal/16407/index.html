<p><p>I went to the Post Office on the way to pick up some certified mail. I was quite happy because I was expecting the deposit back from my rental. Not only did my old landlord have the audacity to charge me $4.42 for posting it to me, but he forgot to put a cheque in the envelope! That and he's added charges of $339.42 for "cleaning" has really pissed me off, doubly so because I made such an effort to leave the place spotless.</p>  </p>

<h2>Threaten</h2>

This is one of the things apartment complexes love to do with people who have moved out - nail them for "cleaning fees".  Most people won't fight it.
<p>
The last place I was at in Minnesota tried to pull this with me (to the tune of about $800).  However, I had gone through a "checkout" list, so I had a receipt that everything was ok from the manager.  That, and I sent the company a nasty letter threatening to sue (the only time I've ever done that) and said some rather nasty things to one of the secretaries.
</p><p>
At the end of the day, I got my money back.  For the amount of money that you're talking about, I would definitely consider legal threats followed by small claims.</p>



<h2>anger management</h2>

I prefer to reserve choice words for those who make the money to compensate for hearing them.



<h2>Ask for things</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/KM/">KM</a> on 2003-12-18T19:53:17</h3>
Ask for receipts for what they did for cleaning charges and what was cleaned. Also look in your lease for what it says about it.<br> <br>Whenever I left a rental I took photos of how I left the place. One place charged me for new carpeting, and I made them produce receipts for it (since I couldn't prove they did it). They produced receipts which were far less than what they charged me for, and I got some money back. I'm surprised you didn't get a checklist upon leaving. One landlord tried charging me $500 for cleaning fees. In the lease it said they would charge $15/hour for any cleaning. I asked her to provide what cleaning was done in a 600^ft apartment for 33 hours of time, and showed photos of how I left the place.<br> <br>Anyways, ask for receipts and proof of what needed to be cleaned, and how long it took and the breakdown of the charges. If they can't provide it, threaten to sue.



<h2>Threats</h2>

I had a "bad landlord" who withheld a deposit from the couple living above us (they got it back in court, I believe).  He didn't do the same to us, and I think the reason why is because at one point, I told him he would not pay him rent until he fixed a termite problem he had promised to fix for months, but never did.  He said, "I don't think that's legal," and I said, "oh yes, it is: it's a health hazard, and we have no obligation to pay rent if you refuse to fix it."  Maybe he got the picture after that, that we wouldn't bend over for him if he tried to screw us on the deposit.
