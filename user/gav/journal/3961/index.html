<a href="http://www.fox.com/24/">24</a> rocks and I have been quite addicted.
<p>
This week I have come to the conclusion that users don't understand <b>data</b>. Most people can't seem to grasp that computers 'see' things differently to them. I was trying to explain that it is pretty hard to write a program that can tell a size from a color, no matter how easy it is for you. Yesterday's gotcha was that that you can't just stick 1/4", 1/4 (6mm), 1/4" ( 6mm) and 1/4",adjustable in the database and expect to be able to search them sensibly.
<p>
/me goes to look for <i>A dummies guide to data</i></p>

<h2>A dummies guide to data</h2>

When I worked at KAOS, one of the seat-warmers who styled himself a "database programmer" ("I learnded FileMakers!") once came sobbing to me that he couldn't take a plain string "4/5/99" and subtract a plain string "3/20/99" and get 16, and why doesn't it work, huh Torgo?<p>I started to explain that you have to convert them to... and he interrupted me and started moaning "I JUST WAAANT IT TO WOOOOOOORRRRRRRRK!!!".  As if I would stop what I was doing, pull a <cite>Clifford the Big Red Dog Does Date Conversion For You</cite> book off the shelf, and do "story time" with him.
</p><p>I don't know what he's doing these days, but I hope he's selling reconditioned fax machines in Tangiers, and nursing an airplane-glue habit.</p>
