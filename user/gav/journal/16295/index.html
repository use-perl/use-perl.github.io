<p><p>The <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=t&s=%5EDJI">Dow Closes Above 10,000</a>! Hopefully this is a sign of the economy getting better. Looking at how well some of our e-commerce clients are doing this xmas, it looks like things have got better already.</p></p>

It still remains to be seen if DOW breaks this 10k line. That it finished once above it doesn't mean much. The Nasdaq was above 2000 already, and sinked back... If DOW stays for a few days above 10k with a rising average, things are good.

<em>It still remains to be seen if DOW breaks this 10k line. That it finished once above it doesn't mean much.</em> <br> <br>Well, technically speaking, no matter where it is doesn't mean much.  It's just a number, and has no real relationship to the market, except what we perceive it to have.<br> <br>That said, it closed at 10,129 today.

<h2>Divining the Dow</h2>

I think the Dow is starting to factor in a Bush defeat next year. The Market doesn't like borrow-and-spend politicos.

yudel, since when?  The Market liked it when Reagan did it.  I think you suffer from a bad case of Wishful Thinking.<br> <br>All that really matters in terms of Bush and the economy is jobs; you need companies to have money before they can create jobs; and right now, companies are gaining money.  It remains to be seen how well jobs will benefit from this.  It seems likely that there will be a net job loss under Bush, but people care less about absolute values than they do about direction, so if the jobless rate is headed down at a good rate, people will be happy about the economy.<br>

Ah! My out-of-thin-air assertions are challenged!<br/><br/>OK, let's see if I can find some graphs of the market and Bush's popularity over the past four years to see whether I'm right or not....
