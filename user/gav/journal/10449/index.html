<p>What is up with the message on this new anti-smoking advert? I know trying to stop kids smoking is a good idea but this is crazy. 

It's ok to sneak out the house, steal your parent's car, go to a party and drink underage, but smoking is wrong?
<p>
While I'm on the subject, does anyone else think that the anti-drug adverts are also somewhat alarmist? Smoking pot won't lower your inhibitions so you get pregnant any more than drinking and one ecstasy tablet probably won't kill you. Does the ends justify the means?</p>

Well, they both make you hungry, only for different things.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-P</p>

Good point, after drinking you run the chance of going and getting a kebab which I'm certain has more serious health risks than most drugs.

<h2>Anit-pot ads considered harmful</h2>

I so agree. These comercials are utter garbage.<br> <br>One says that pot is evil but having a loaded gun sitting on a desk in a house with children is fine.<br> <br>Another implies that pot is the cause of teenage pregnancy, completely forgetting about liquor which is infinitely more likely to lead to it.<br> <br>If they really wanted to show the dangers of pot they should focus on loss of motivation, which is the biggest drawback of the substance.<br> <br>The basic fact is that alcohol is far more debilitating than pot. It has far stronger and more dangerous effects on the body. It causes far more judgement loss. It causes far more motor skill loss. And while pot induces a paronoia that throttles the dangerous things you might otherwise do, alcohol has the opposite effect.<br> <br>Pete
