<p><p>A few weeks back I bought a <a href="http://www.karate-mart.com/cenwav.html">Century Wavemaster punch bag</a>. It just sat in the corner because I was too lazy to get to Home Depot and buy a hose to fill the base with water. Last night I finally summoned up the courage to face the Depot and came away with a hose (which I had to duct tape to my kitchen sink because they sold me the wrong fitting) and filled it. I had so much fun punching the crap out of it. Ten minutes of substained violence makes me feel much less stressed. I'd recommend a Wavemaster for anyone who doesn't like the idea of hanging a punch bag from the ceiling.</p></p>

<h2>Halo</h2>

This was essentially the goal of my time spent replaying Halo's lower levels -- grab a gun, blow the shit out of something, fire bullets into the corpses when they don't die after the first salvo hits.  There are days that it feels good to watch corpses fly after a grenade goes off.
<p>
This, along with screaming curses and advising these various nonexistent enemies to die in various ways, would qualify me for psychiatric care in a heartbeat, if it were not for my strange little universe being shared.</p>
