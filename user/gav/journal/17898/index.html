<p><p>After not having any problems for 2 years my iBook won't boot. It froze up on me and I had to take the battery out and reboot. It restarted, everything was looking ok and then I got a kernel panic. Since then I haven't been able to get it to boot, the screen stays black. I can't even make it boot off the install cd. Any ideas?</p></p>

<h2>Logic Board Problem.</h2>

Are you sure that it's not booting? There is a well known problem with iBooks and their Logic Boards. So well known that Apple is repairing any of the affected ones (even those outside of warranty). Details are available <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/ibook/faq/" title="apple.com">here</a apple.com>.I know a number of people who have had this problem, including my wife.

Thanks for the tip. My iBook's serial number was in the range that could have problems so I called up Apple.<br> <br>One thing to watch out for is that if your iBook is out of warranty they'll charge you $49 to get to talk to them. You do get that back if they think the problem is the logic board. The other thing that annoyed me is that they charged me $49 to back up my hard drive. As I can't turn mine to boot I had to pay. There's no way to say "only charge me if you have to give me a new hard drive".<br> <br>

When my wife's died, I was still able to SSH into it and copy the important files off. You might want to give that a try.<br>Her's was still in the 1 year warranty period but outside of the 3 month call in period (we did purchase AppleCare before the 1 year was up just in case). They seem to be flexible on that point if they don't have to talk to you for long. I was referred to a local repair shop that answered more questions and completed the problem determination.

Sounds like a logic board failure, yep.  Almost everyone I know with an iBook has had a one.<br> <br>When my logic board failed I brought it to my local Apple dealer from which I purchased it (Mac Force) rather than trying to deal with Apple directly.  They eventually sent it on to Apple, but Mac Force backed up my hard drive as a courtesy, so I didn't have to pay any ransom money to Apple for my data.<br> <br>Moral of the story: buy your Apple equipment from a good dealer, let them deal with them.<br>

You might want to take a look at an apple support file called <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=14449" title="apple.com">Reset the Power Management Unit (PMU)</a apple.com>.<br>

I tried that and it didn't work because the documentation isn't right. For my model (800mhz 32VRAM) you don't hold it down for 5 seconds, you hold it down until it chimes 4 times.
