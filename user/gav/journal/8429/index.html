<p>This week has felt long. I've been here until 7-8 all week. I don't
think I've accomplished nearly as much as I should have. Things are 
pretty busy for us in the lead up to xmas, it's the busiest time of the
year by far for our clients. Jeremy Zawodny mentions that
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/000237.html#000237">Task Switching Sucks</a>
and I agree. It's killed me this week. Anyway, less whining, more 
content...
<p>
<a href="http://store.yahoo.com">Yahoo Store</a> got a facelift this week
(apart from the <a href="http://www.estey.com/im/yahoo-facelift.png">info page</a>).
It's nice to see that two of the four featured stores, 
<a href="http://www.strouds.com">Strouds</a> and <a href="http://www.alight.com">Alight</a>
are <a href="http://www.bock.com">ours</a>. I've worked extensively on both and
I'm proud of the results.
<p>
I got two strange (<a href="http://www.estey.com/im/mess1.png">here</a> 
and <a href="http://www.estey.com/im/mess2.png">here</a>) windows messaging spams
over the weekend as I left my work pc on (see slashdot article on 
<a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/askslashdot/02/10/10/1945240.shtml?tid=111">NetBIOS spam</a>).
The strange thing is that port 139 is firewalled off here, so it looks like somebody connected
a machine to our network which was re-broadcasting these messages. Something to
investigate further...
<p>
My new server, dual P3-550, 768mb, 9.1 gig scsi, 2U rack (only $345 from Ebay!) came
Tuesday and I'm testing RedHat 8 on it. 8 seems to install a lot more crap than 7.3,
but a quick visit to <tt>chkconfig --list</tt> and a bit of <tt>rpm -e [rpm]</tt>
easily rectifies that. The more disturbing thing is that I think Perl is broke on it
(they ship 5.8) as I can't get Compress::Zlib to install. Arse.
<p>
Anyway, must get back to work. More updates later.

<h2>netbios spam</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2002-10-18T08:14:26</h3>
I got a network message popup advertising some useless product and.or service when at the console of our main webserver.
<p>
The webserver is supposed to be secure but what with having a bunch of dodgy php, asp and other components and shareware installed on it I am thinking its a pretty weak link in our network.
</p><p>
I am unsure if its NetBIOS getting thru the firewall which is a big concern or if it came from the LAN, but it didn't appear anywhere else on the LAN so probably the former - eek!
