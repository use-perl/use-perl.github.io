<p>Today I got what I thought was a renewal notice for one of my domains from Verisign, asking $29 for another year. Fair enough I thought and started filling out my credit card details. Then I thought, hang on, I wasn't in the country on May 15th (deadline printed at the top of the page). Closer inspection reveals that I was just about to transfer my domain to them (it's currently handled by <a href="http://www.lowcostdomains.com">Low Cost Domains</a>). I can't believe Verisign are stooping to this unethical behaviour, I can imagine these landing on the desks of secretaries or busy people (like me) and them paying for it. This kind of thing should be illegal. I'm quite vexed by this.

/me goes to find somebody to write to and complain</p>

You should probably complain to the FTC.  www.ftc.gov, I believe.

I read about it somewhere (probably Slashdot) a while back.  Various fly-by-night domain registrars have been doing that sort of thing for years.  I was a little surprised to see VeriSign doing it, though, since their whole business is based on trust and since they're the AT&amp;T of registrars.  Usually the default, high-priced company in a particular industry contents itself with having poor customer service and doesn't stoop to fraudulent marketing practices.  But then marketers are scum, and becoming scummier all the time.
