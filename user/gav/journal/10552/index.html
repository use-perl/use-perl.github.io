I have a new addiction; CNN. I like to think of it as my gateway to terror and fear. I'm glad that the war on terror is going so well that I can tune into channel 35 and have pure fear pumped into my home.
</p>
<p>
Now it seems that Homeland Security are worried that we aren't scared enough. We should be concentrating on the unknown threat from unknown parties and getting prepared. Personally I'm about to run to Home Depot and buy enough duct tape and plastic sheeting so I can suffocate while watching the terror on CNN.
</p>
<p>
As long as I'm in constant fear I can thank God that we aren't letting the terrorists win. I'm just hoping we can get on with the war in Iraq so that the world can be a better place. The main problem with these terrorists is that you don't know that somebody is a terrorist until they've blown themselves up. I'm pretty sure that George W. is going to round them all up as soon as those damn Europeans stop getting in the way.

I caught some of the "advice" pertaining to surviving a "terrorist" attack. I'm with you about the suffocating bit. If I duct tape and use plastic sheeting to create a "safe room" I'll be dead sooner from lack of breathable air than from the attack.<br> <br>I'll take my chances and just drink all of the whiskey in my house so I won't feel the nasty terrorist attack killing me.

I'm going to use the tip I learnt from watching <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0066769" title="imdb.com">The Andromeda Strain</a imdb.com> and get really drunk (I have a bottle of vodka in the fridge for such emergencies).
<p>
Either that or use the skills I learnt from <a href="http://www.mrbillsadventureland.com/reviews/e-f/freddyphR/freddyphR.htm" title="mrbillsadventureland.com">Freddy Pharkas</a mrbillsadventureland.com> and build a gas mask out of a can and some charcoal.

Who said that movies and video games weren't educational?</p>
