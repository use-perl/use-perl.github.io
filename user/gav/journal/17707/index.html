<p><p>So I want to get a list of the previous orders I've placed with Apple so I can print out the invoices. I log in to find that you can only retrieve an order if you know the order number. After calling Apple I get all my past order numbers. Then I find that you can only find out shipping information. They don't want to remind you how much you paid each time. I then have to call up and waste 15 minutes getting them emailed to me, which can take up to 12 hours to get here. It's sad when a technology company can't use it's technology to make customers happy.</p></p>

<h2>Apple Store Suckage, con't</h2>

Agreed!  Worse, if you place orders with them<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/online/ you can get the order information fairly easily.  They just don't associate your phone orders with your apple store login, so you can't get those easily.<br> <br>The online Apple Store experience has many of the problems Apple tries to avoid elsewhere.  It's depressing!

If I placed telephone orders I could forgive them for not associating them with my login. But if they force you to log in and create an account you should be able to get access to your order history, otherwise half the point of logging in is gone.

Aha!  I was going to note that "you<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/can/ see your history," but now I see that you only get 90 days of it.  I guess I'd never looked for more.  Lame!<br> <br>Makes me want XML Receipts.
