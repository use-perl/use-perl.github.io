<p>Ok, so I've finally worked out how to send myself my password so I can log in. <br/><br/>I guess I should write a little bit about myself. I'm a brit who got lost while adventuring around the world and ended up getting a job as a perl programmer in in Vermont. <br/><br/>Most of my day to day stuff is hacking at Yahoo store writing data munging and spidering thingies. You're most likely to spot LWP or one of the HTML::Parser modules (I have a particular preference for HTML::TreeBuilder) at the top of one of my scripts. You'd be surprised at how perverse Yahoo store is, they use lisp closures (who'd have thought of lisp cgi scripts?) for most of the links which change from page to page and some other tricky things which means I've stared at LWP debugging output until I've gone cross eyed.<br/><br/>I just worked out that Text::ParseWords does a great job of parsing Yahoo options (why do I always seem to forget about this module?) so I'll have to get back to hacking at things.<br/><br/>Gav.<br/><br/></p>

<h2>TreeBuilder</h2>

        HTML::TreeBuilder</em>
<p>Oh, so <em>you're</em> the one who's been using it!  Neat!</p>



<h2>Awesome intro</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-03-14T22:08:06</h3>
<p>Sounds like you're into some really neat stuff.  I'll be looking forward to hearing more.</p>

<p>I've heard about that LISP system before; slashdot had a link half a year ago to an article by the original author of the code, now moved on from Yahoo.  A memorable quote was his explanation of what he looked for in a company: if their job descriptions were looking for LISP, he knew they were innovative and were going to be doing good things and worth investing in.</p>

<p>Oh, shoot.  Given my sig, I guess I'm obligated now to find out if it's "LISP," "Lisp," or "lisp."</p>

Aha, I see I'm not the only use.perl.org Brit on <b>this</b> side of the pond then.  I wound up in Arizona though.



<h2>Finally found the link</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-05-09T15:46:40</h3>
<p>As a result of <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/ziggy/journal/4791" title="perl.org">ziggy's latest journal entry</a perl.org>, I finally found the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/lib/paulgraham/sec.txt" title="paulgraham.com">link</a paulgraham.com> to the article by the guy who wrote the Yahoo store code.</p>
