<p>I went to Kmart today to pick up some random household items. I prefer Kmart over Walmart because it's closer, smaller (I can actually find things) and the tax is 1% less (Walmart is in a different town). 
<p>
There are two things that Kmart do that <b>really</b> annoy me. Firstly they have about half the amount of staff they should have so that the queues at the checkout are frustrating and you can never find a staff member to help you. Secondly they put things on sale but don't allow you to buy them at sale price. The problem is that the sale starts tommorow but markdowns are shown a day early. If I came back tommorow and got the shower curtain I got today I would have saved $2. This does nothing but frustrate me.
<p>
If my local Kmart is representive of the whole company, I am not surprised that they had to file for Chapter 11. When you are competing with heavyweights like Walmart you can't afford to slip up.
<p>
One thing that did impress me today was the first episode of the <a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/cmp/black.html">Animatrix</a>. It's well worth the download.
