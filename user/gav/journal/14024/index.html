<p><p>On the radio today I heard "Diamonds and Guns" by the <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=A96vsa9ygw23f">Transplants</a>, an intriguing mix of punk, rock, and rap. I also head something by <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=Bhs1gtq6zpu4o">Audioslave</a> for the first time. I thought it reminded me of Soundgarden,  I didn't realise it was Chris Cornell until I looked them up. Then I remembered that both Jane's Addiction and Drugstore have new CDs out so like a good consumer I bought these four from the nice people at <a href="http://cheap-cds.com">cheap-cds</a>. </p>

<p>If you like fantasy I can wholeheartedly recommend Terry Goodkind's "Sword of Truth" series. I've finished the first four novels and am relishing the remanding three. Unlike Robert Jordan who crawls to some impossible conclusion with his "Wheel of Time" series, each novel is an enjoyable self-contained story within the overall story. I also have recently finished Alastair Reynolds' "Chasm City", an involving sci-fi with twists, turns, and mystery a-plenty. </p>

<p>While I was in Border's spending my life's savings I also spotted that the <a href="http://www.intothematrix.com/">Animatrix</a> DVD is finally released. I really liked the free episodes so I thought I might as well buy it. Well I've helped the enconomy enough today so I think I deserve a beer.</p>
