The thing I didn't like about <a href="http://rc3.org/cgi-bin/less.pl?arg=5040">Rafe's comments</a> was that it allowed people like <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/03/17#When:3:59:05AM">Dave Winer</a> to make idiotic remarks: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<i>Rafe Colburn explains why Algol-like languages are far superior to Perl for working on large scale, multi-programmer, long-term projects.</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
My feeling is that it's unfair to consider a 135-line script like Blosxom and use that as an example of things that would be bad for larger projects. You can get away with a lot in a short script and I consider that one of the <b>strengths</b> of Perl. Some of the Blosxom code is a bit more compact than I'd write but that isn't the point, you'd not get much done in 135 lines of Java. 
</p>
<p>
I also find the one line of Perl a lot easier to understand than the 15 lines of Java. I think it is a lot easier to maintain shorter programs even if the code is more complex (though there is an upper limit to how complex it can be before this isn't the case). I would definitely have put wrapped the code in a function if I was going to use it more than once.

<h2>blosxom style</h2>

And blosxom is not really the most lucid code around.<br> <br>It's full of some very 'unclean' code. It works, which<br>is great. I don't intend to disparage Rael, but his<br>code is somewhat crufty and is also (slightly) hindered<br>by it having to work on early perls, not just 5.6+.<br> <br>I keep meaning to do some tidyups and submit them to<br>Rael, including having it able to run under<br>Apache::Registry, but never get around to it.<br>



<h2>Algol-like?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TorgoX/">TorgoX</a> on 2003-03-21T02:29:56</h3>
"why Algol-like languages are far superior to Perl".
<p>I thought Perl <em>is</em> an Algol-like language.  It's been ages since I heard the term "Algol-like", but I always took it to mean syntax mostly like C or Algol, with blocks with statements inside, as opposed to very different syntaxes like Lisp or Forth, or the mush that is COBOL syntax.</p>

<h2>Re:Algol-like?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gav/">gav</a> on 2003-03-21T02:59:03</h3>
I've always thought Pascal more Algol-like than C style languages. I guess Java is like <a href="http://cgibin.erols.com/ziring/cgi-bin/cep/cep.pl?_key=Algol" title="erols.com">Algol</a erols.com> to the same degree that English is like Latin, that is after you drink several beers and squint.

<h2>followups</h2>

reading his <a href="http://www.rc3.org/cgi-bin/less.pl?arg=5043" title="rc3.org">followups</a rc3.org>
It seems he still doesn't get it.
<p>
blosxom is a drop-in perl script you certainly can't use it represent a project in which a novice is taking part.
</p><p>
Worse he misses the point about abstracting code in functions - essentially your senior or experienced developers will encapsulate harder code and the the junior or novice developers will use the API's provided.
</p><p>
This means the senior developers can use perl to full effect while juniors can be productive with simpler perl.
