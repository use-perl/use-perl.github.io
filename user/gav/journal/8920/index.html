<p>Living in an apartment does have a advantages but sometimes I wish I had a nice house to live in. Usually these thoughts start when the garbage truck reverses past my window at 6am (beep! beep! beep! beep!) but tonight it was washing. Laundry involves real effort when you don't have a washing machine. I went to the bank, picked up $10 of quarters, sorted my laundry, lugged it down the hall and in it went. The real joy was an hour or so later when I noticed that the tumble-dryer wasn't working, it was spinning but without any heat. It was even more fun picking out my wet clothes as opening it didn't stop the spinning. I now have two loads of dripping wet clothes scattered about my apartment.</p>

<h2>selling point</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/koschei/">koschei</a> on 2002-11-13T04:36:15</h3>
One of the major selling points of where I live at the moment<br>(other than being a 3 minute walk from work; admittedly it's<br>a job I obtained *after* I started living here), is that the<br>apartment came with its own laundry bit. So I don't have to<br>share. It's great.<br>
