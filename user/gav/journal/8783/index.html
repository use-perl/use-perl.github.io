My copy of the <a href="http://www.masonbook.com/">Mason book</a> came in the post today (from <a href="http://www.bookpool.com/.x/SSSSSSPRIM/sm/0596002254">Bookpool</a>). I've added that to my reading list as I am keen on using it for a largish project I'm going to be embarking on in the next couple of months. It joins Vanessa Donnelly's "<a href="
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201674688/">Designing Easy-to-use Web Sites: A Hands-on Approach to Structuring Successful Websites</a>", which I have been flicking through in the rare few minutes of spare time I've had. I was interested because it uses UML extensively and the fact that I found it for $6 brand new from one of Amazon's "Used & new" sellers made it too much of a bargain to resist.   
</p><p>
I've also printed out the latest editions of <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com/">The Perl Review</a> and <a href="http://www.tpj.com/">The Perl Journal</a> (hopefully worth my $12) to add to my bed time reading collection. On top of that I'm currently trying to read Alastair Reynolds' "Revelation Space". A quick check of the TV reminds me that <a href="http://www.fox.com/24/">24</a> is on at 9pm. 24 was great last season, I hope this season is going to be as good as the last.
</p><p>
On life related adventures, my housemate has finally moved out. I didn't realize how many of the  household essentials were hers. I've had to go out and buy a microwave, a vacuum cleaner, a complete set of pots, plans, glasses, dishes, and cutlery, various cooking utensils, a phone, an answering machine, a water filter, and a light (for some reason there are no overhead lights in my apartment). That made a nice big dent in my credit card, and leads nicely to the next exciting news, I was approved for my 3rd credit card with a whopping $300 credit limit. My first two are $200 and $250. I'm gaining credit over here at an almost frightening rate of $50 every six months!
</p><p>
Does anyone know of an alternative HTML editor that can treat links like cross references? Recently I have found myself writing my entries in AbiWord (strangely a word not in the AbiWord dictionary) so that I don't have to suffer the confines of a TEXTAREA and get to use a spell checker. Basically I copy and paste all my urls at the end of the page and go back through and replace them when I'm done. Otherwise I find all the HTML very distracting. Any ideas?
</p><p>
p.s. I just got a reply back from Bookpool, I inquired about the permanency of their URLs, and they were kind enough to write back within 15 minutes (thanks Susan!) and let me know that they are more permanent than they look. That's great customer service.
