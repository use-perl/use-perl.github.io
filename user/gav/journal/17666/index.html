<br />I understand that you think MySQL is garbage. If you tell me so I will first assume you are a Postgres user. Listen up guys, get over the popularity contest.

<p>I'm a happy Perl and MySQL user, both tools have advantages and disadvantages compared to other tools. I'm sure a different person would use a different toolset to solve the problems I solve with them. I'm just happy that we have these choices.</p>

For a long time, the only game in town was Matt Wright, and Matt's scripts got a lot of airplay and mindspace.  But the NMS project rewrote them, and now there's no reason to use Matt's scripts now that NMS is out.  But that doesn't stop people from continuing to suggest Matt's stuff, only because they don't know any better.
<p>
MySQL is there mostly from inertia now.  Other than legacy compatibility, there's really no reason to use it.  So for new starts, I'm trying to help set the record straight, in the NMS vs MSA manner.</p>

I still don't understand your issue with MySQL. It's not like it's a big security risk which was the reason to avoid Matt's scripts. What is wrong with MySQL?

The main point in the nms vs Matt Wright thing was not the security issues (most of those have been cleaned up in even Matt's code), it was that people who knew Perl knew that Matt's programs weren't good Perl.<br> <br>It's the same with MySQL vs PostgreSQL. People who know databases know that MySQL isn't a good database. Sure it does the job if your requirements are simple. It probably looks great if you're coming from something like MS Access, but if you're used to using a "real" relational database system like DB2 or Oracle then MySQL just doesn't cut it. It just doesn't have many of the things that people who design real databases see as essential. A few of the most obvious ones are:<br> <br>* Transactions<br>* Sub-selects<br>* Stored procedures<br>* Referential integrity<br> <br>Without these features you are just playing at database design.<br> <br>I know that some of these are about to be or have recently been added to MySQL, but they've been in PostgreSQL for years. They are stable features in PostgreSQL but cutting edge in MySQL.<br> <br>So if you want something which is basically a cut-down version of SQL for accessing data stored in very simple tables then ue MySQL. But if you want something that looks and acts like an Open Source version of Oracle, then PostgreSQL is the way to go.

<p> <i>* Transactions</i> </p>

<p>There is a lot of interesting things on the horizon for MySQL users, especially due to the merging with SAP DB. You can use MaxDB which has a lot of these features working now.</p>

You can still add a foreign key that doesn't have an associated primary key value or delete a primary key that has existing foreign key values.<br> <br>Sounds like it's getting there, but PostgreSQL is already there - and has been for some time. That's my main point.

<p>That's fair, but Randal's point is that SQLite and PostgreSQL have superseded MySQL at the things MySQL is good at.  If I were to apply your rule above to that situation, I could fairly claim that SQLite and PostgreSQL are getting there but MySQL is already there and has been for some time.</p>

<p>Is that a facile analysis?  Absolutely.</p>

<p>Still, the whole debate seems to be that "MySQL doesn't have these features!  Well, okay, but they only just added them!  Well, okay, but it doesn't have all!  Well, okay, but they're not stable yet!  Well, okay, but they haven't had them for years and years!  Well, okay, but it's still a toy!"</p>

<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2004-02-28T09:53:04</h3>
<p>That's a terrible analogy.  It's no secret that Matt's scripts are poorly written (is MySQL poorly written?), with no support (does MySQL have support?), numerous security flaws (is MySQL insecure?), and no active development (has MySQL stopped progressing?).</p>

<p>I'll tell you reasons to use it over PostgreSQL: better support on Windows, nicer client interface, better documentation, from the project itself as well as from third parties, and a much saner upgrade scheme.  I also hear that its replication support is much nicer.</p>

<p>Hey, there are reasons to choose MySQL over PostgreSQL too, especially if you're already familiar with triggers and constraints, if you want to use the inheritable tables, or you're migrating from Oracle.  Those are also good reasons.</p>

<p>It's not 1998 anymore, though.  I think people deserve better explanations than "it's teh old b0rked!"</p>

Neither of the options Randal presented would be satisfactory for Slashdot: SQLite is too lite, and PostgreSQL is too slow.  We have transactions when we need them (which is seldom), we don't need or want stored procedures.  Lack of subselects sucks, but you take the good with the bad.  So, whatever.

<p>search.cpan uses MySQL. It's never been a performance star but, then again, neither has Perl. I also use MySQL for a lot of other stuff. The only gripe I have with it that I've begged Monty for rather shamelessly is the lack of cascading deletes. </p>
