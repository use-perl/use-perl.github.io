<p>My DSL isn't working. It's rejecting my password. I call the nice folks at Verizon to find out what the matter is:<br/><br/>[ long hold time ]
Verizon: what's your phone number?
Me: XXX-XXX-XXXX
Verizon: Business or residential?
Me: Residential
Verizon: Is that a dial-up account?
Me: No
Verizon: Sorry this is the dial-up technical support number, the automated system must have transfered you here by mistake.
[ music ]
Verizon: what's your phone number?
Me: XXX-XXX-XXXX
Verizon: Business or residential?
Me: Residential
Verizon: What state is that?
Me: Vermont
Verizon: Sorry this is west coast support, I'm unable to lookup your details.
[ transferring to another department ]
Verizon: what's your phone number?
Me: XXX-XXX-XXXX
Verizon: Business or residential?
Me: Residential
Verizon: Can you confirm your name?
Me: Gavin Estey
Verizon: Can you spell it?
Me: G-A-V-I-N E-S-T-E-Y
Verizon: Thank you Kevin.
Me: No GAVIN
Verizon: What state are you in?
Me: Vermont
Verizon: Sorry I can't help you I'll have to transfer you to the east coast support number...
[ long hold... helpful automated messages telling me to reboot my machine ]
Verizon: what's your phone number?
Me: XXX-XXX-XXXX
Verizon: What's the problem?
Me: I can't log in. I get a PPPoE authentication error.
Verizon: Your DSL account has been deactivated.
Me: That was supposed to happen on the 24th.
Verizon: That's the date it's going to be moved to your new address.
Me: So why is it deactivated now? Can't you un-deactivate it?
Verizon: Sorry that's impossible. We can give you a free dial up account though.
Me: Thanks. So am I being billed for my DSL now you've turned it off?
Verizon: I can't find that out. You have to talk to our billing department who are closed now.
Me: Ok. So can I check to see what address you are going to send my new modem to?
Verizon: You need to talk to sales... but they close at 6pm.
Me: Ok. So as you've already de-activated my DSL can you move the date up from the 24th.
Verizon: You'd have to talk to the cancellation department... but they're closed.

What a bunch of tools! I hate places that when you call support, they can't seem to support anything!<br> <br>At least they thought your name was Kevin. Maybe someone will one day call me Gavin and complete the circle of stupidity.

I think it's a tree, not a circle.  I get called Kevin as well, and my name is Keith.
