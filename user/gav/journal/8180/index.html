<p>After getting the "Free service limited due to high load" message from <tt>up2date</tt> on my RedHat server one too many times, I installed <a href="http://apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org/">APT-RPM</a>. I works great, with that on my server and Ximian's Red Carpet on my desktop box, I am sorted.
<p>
Went to see the bank about a mortgage and pretty much decided that I'm not ready at the moment. After 14 months in the country I still have no credit rating which would make things difficult. I think a year of saving will help and they suggested that I get a loan so that they could see me making regular payments which means I have an excuse to buy an iBook :)
<p>
I am going to be moving out December 1st. I'm not too keen on the apartment I have and I'm not keen on my new landlord (who bought the building a couple of months back). So I'll be apartment hunting.  </p>

<h2>No Credit</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vek/">vek</a> on 2002-10-04T22:26:38</h3>
I know <b>exactly</b> what you mean.  I've been in the US for just over 5 years now so I do actually have a credit rating of my own.  When we first moved to the US I was told that having no credit rating was (in some ways) worse than having a bad credit rating.  Luckily the ol' wifey had a good credit rating so we were still able to get car loans etc.  Once I'd built up good credit rating of my own we were able to buy the house we wanted.  It just took a little time.
