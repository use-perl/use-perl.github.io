<p><p>I watched the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0235737">Salton Sea</a> <a href="http://www.estey.com/archives/000032.html">again</a> last night. It's a great film starring Val Kilmer which is a rare thing. It has a fantastic crank fueled flashforwards sequence involving the theft of Bob Hope's stool stample, which should have won an oscar for best use of a DustBuster as a weapon. The shoot out at Pooh-Bear's is so Dirty Harry it brought a smile to my face. You must go and rent this film.</p>
<p>I finished reading "Stormrider", David Gemmell's fourth Rigante novel. I've enjoyed reading his books since I first read "Legend" and while this doesn't have a character who can compare with Druss, it's still a great read. I like that the Rigante series is almost historical in nature with the Rigante as the wild Scottish clans fighting against the Roman might of the Varlish. Throw in a classic good versus evil storyline, magic and witchcraft, interesting characters, and dramatic battles; this is heroic fantasy worth reading.</p>
<p>I also finished  William Gibson's "All Tommorow's Parties". If you like his previous novels you'll probably like this one. Short snappy chapters lead you though this fast paced story. Something is going to be happening in the near future in San Francisco, something that seems to entangle a diverse set of characters as they converge on the bridge, now a chaotic shantytown.  Perhaps after 8 years, William Gibson can be finally forgiven for the pain he caused with <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0113481">Johnny Mnemonic</a>, this is another book worth picking up.</p></p>
