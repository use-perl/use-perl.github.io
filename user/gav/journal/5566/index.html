<p>As I'm in the process of getting a notebook, I've decided that I no longer need to have windows on my home machine. The main reasons is that all I use this box for is perl hacking, irc, web and email. 
<p>
I've decided on <a href="http://www.redhat.com">RedHat</a> 7.3 and burnt all 3 cds at work (beauty of being able to download at 150k/s). My to do list before d-day is:
<ul>
<li>Get a new soundcard, I have a Turtle Beach Montego II OEM from Dell, and it seems the chances of it working are minimal. Looks like a $20 Creative Labs PC128 should do the trick or is there a more reliable model about?</li><p>
<li>Work out what to do about hard disk situation. This machine only has space for 2 disks (since I put a cd-writer in). Both are 20 gig, one is full of MP3s the other half full. Been considering some kind of external USB kit so I can take it back and forth to work. They claim 900k/s which is more than fast enough for MP3s. No idea if they will work in Linux though. Buy shiny new 40 gig disk.</li><p>
<li>Never used a cd-writer in Linux. Worry for a second that it won't work. Realise that you haven't used it in months anyway.</li><p>
<li>Feel glad that you paid the extra money for a DSL Router/Firewall so you can use DHCP and not have to worry that RedHat will try to sneak in as many services as possible :)</li><p>
<li>Go and find out where to get PC100 memory and upgrade to 256mb. Prepare to marvel at how cheap the stuff is</li>
</ul>
I've been contemplating wussing out and installing Win2k just because I know it will work, but that does seem the cowardly way out...</p>
