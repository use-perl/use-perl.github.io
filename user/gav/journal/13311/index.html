<div class="span8">
<p><p>I'm sure this is obvious to a lot of people, but it's a trick that has come in handy for me. Often you want an sequence field that's a bit more clever than just an <tt>auto_increment</tt>, for example if you want to control the starting point of the sequence (actually you could just insert and then delete junk rows).</p>
<p>The problem I had is that I couldn't just create an <tt>auto_increment</tt> column as the table had multi-column primary keys and the sequence was based on one of these keys. For example, given this table:</p>
<pre>
CREATE TABLE widgets (
  line varchar(250) NOT NULL,
  id int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (line, id)
)
</pre>
<p>With this data:</p>
<pre>
(foo, 1), (foo, 2), (foo, 3), (bar, 5), (bar, 6)
</pre>
<p>Each line of widgets has it's own sequence of ids so we need a table to keep track of the next one:</p>
<pre>
CREATE TABLE next_ids (
  line varchar(250) NOT NULL,
  next_id int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default '1',
  PRIMARY KEY (store)
) 
</pre>
<p>Which then just has one row per sequence:</p>
<pre>
(foo, 4), (bar, 7)
</pre>
<p>Then it's just a simple matter of locking the table and grabbing the next id:</p>
<pre>
LOCK TABLES next_ids WRITE;
SELECT next_id FROM next_ids WHERE line = 'foo';
UPDATE next_ids SET next_id = 5 WHERE line 'foo';
UNLOCK TABLES;
</pre>
<p>The advantage of using a separate table rather than doing a SELECT MAX(id)... on the widgets table is that we can do things like skip ids or take advantage of Perl's magical ++ to have alphanumeric keys.</p>
<p>I'm sure people who are using "real" databases are laughing at this malarky :)</p></p>

I haven't used it, but MySQL auto_increment columns are supposed to work that way already, aren't they?  Define a multicolumn primary key where the last part is an auto_increment, and it works.<br> <br>Oh, <a href="http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/example-AUTO_INCREMENT.html" title="mysql.com">I see</a mysql.com>.  It's only for MyISAM (which I use) and BDB (which is dead).  Maybe you're using InnoDB.

You are right, I should have mentioned that.
<br> <br>
The real reason for doing it the complicated way was that I needed it for order ids and I needed to be able to finer control over sequences.
<br> <br>
I've also used it to port a MS-SQL database where products had positive ids and sub-products had negative ids and I needed to have both in the same table.
