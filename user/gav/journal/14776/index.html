<p><p>So I buy the correct USB thingy and now my TiVo is all networked happily so I can remove the 30ft phone cable. I went out and got <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/tivohks/">TiVo Hacks</a> and have been flipping through it for the last two days. I then went and borrowed my friend's USB-to-Serial adaptor so I could hack it and get <a href="http://tivo.lightn.org/">TiVo Web</a> installed which looked pretty cool and a lot better than paying $99 for the <a href="http://www.tivo.com/4.9.asp">Home Media Option</a>. Tonight I noticed a little note on page 56, "Those of you with Series 2 machines are a little out of luck". Well thanks a fucking lot. You can't do most of the hacks in the book which makes it a $25 waste of money. <b>Don't buy this book unless you have a Series 1 box</b>. I'm pretty pissed off at ORA for not making this more obvious. Bastards.</p></p>

<p>See pages <em>xv</em> and <em>xvi</em> of the Preface.</p>

<p>(See also <a href="http://hacks.oreilly.com/" title="oreilly.com">the Hacks homepage</a oreilly.com> for an update that just may help.  Remember, though, I know nothing.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Who reads the preface anyway? It's not obvious enough, especially if you are buying it online. The book really should be called "TiVo Series 1 Hacks", especially as the TiVos sold now are Series 2. I'm sure I'm not going to be the only one caught out by this.
<br> <br>
Luckily <a href="http://www.bookpool.com/" title="bookpool.com">Bookpool</a bookpool.com> will accept my return, though I'll end up paying shipping both ways. I'm still a bit pissed at ORA, I'd expect better of them.

<p>I know people don't read the preface when they buy online...</p>

<p>I'll admit O'Reilly may have flubbed up here, but I don't let one mistake condemn them forever.  (Although I'm not the one out the cost of shipping * 2.)</p>

<p>Seems like I was aware of the fact that the book applied only to older Tivos.  I'm not sure where I picked up that information, especially since I don't own a Tivo and haven't looked into buying the book.  It's possible I saw that somewhere on O'Reilly's website, so maybe they didn't technically flub up; maybe they just didn't make it prominent enough.</p>

<p>Maybe I didn't hint strongly enough.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p> <em>If you can wait a couple of weeks; there's an easy way to hack the Series 2 using just software, not a soldering iron.</em> </p>
