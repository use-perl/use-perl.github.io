I wish I could be at TPC (and YAPC) as it seems fun (and it would be nice to meet some perl people, there don't seem to be any in Vermont) but money and my general workload has made that impossible. Next year I'm hoping to make it to YAPC and <a href="http://www.geekcruises.com/home/pw3_home.html">Perl Whirl '03</a>. I'm hoping that planning a year in advance will help me get my act together.<p>It was nice that <a href="http://www.bock.com">we</a> were mentioned in the latest Yahoo Store newsletter and it seems exciting things are on the horizon.<p>This week I've been busy setting up my own server. It's been a challenge but I've learnt a lot more about linux, apache, et al. Uninteresting sites <a href="http://chicken.bock.com">here</a> and <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a> set up <a href="http://www.estey.com">here</a>. MT is definatly an impressive piece of software.<p>On the project front I've been working on member history and a (better) multiple ship-to option for a Yahoo store which has been fun. It is my first big project that makes heavy use of Class::DBI and Template::Toolkit and I've found both to be fantastic. One strange thing, our client uses a 1 digit year field which seems very daring :)<p>The next big project is a wedding registry which looks interesting.<p>I've been thinking more about working on a project like nms, but targeted more at developers so it uses things like MySQL and Template Toolkit etc. For example I was thinking that it would be nice to have a mailto script that you could configure over the web, setting things like validation and email addresses to send to, etc.<p>
I've been also drawing pretty pictures and making notes about the work on our mass mailer. I was thinking that it would be nice to open source it, but I'm thinking it is too risky to let it out in the wild (you can do too much damage with it). Any thoughts?</p>

<i>One strange thing, our client uses a 1 digit year field which seems very daring<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> </i> <br> <br>During my second work term at university I was fixing the one-digit version of the Y2K concern. (This was in 1970 and the new decade had just triggered some problems.)<br> <br>This was in the customer records for an oil company.  They kept records for a few years of history, but also had to sometimes deal with dates that had a future year (don't deliver any fuel oil to my house next February).<br> <br>Using mod 10 arithmetic, (up to) five years previous, the current year, and two years in the future were allowed, leaving two years that were treated as invalid to catch items that were going out of range.
