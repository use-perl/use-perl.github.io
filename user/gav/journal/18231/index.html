<h2>I wouldn't hire them</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/phillup/">phillup</a> on 2004-04-07T19:34:54</h3>
if they really wrote "Java Script" as two words.<br> <br>I think anyone that has really done that much coding wouldn't make that mistake. (If they made that mistake on a resume... they aren't detail oriented enough for me.)

<h3><a href="/user/tinman/">tinman</a> on 2004-04-07T21:32:17</h3>
<p>I've used most of those (PeopleTools, I don't know), but I definitely wouldn't put them on a resume; because I don't think I know enough.
</p><p>Is that person implying frequent use or familiarity ? Passing "I've seen what this looks like, read some code, fiddled with it" type answers are certainly possible.. Developer level, I-dont-need-no-stinking-reference-manual type knowledge.. ? umm, wow.</p>

<p>That's why I extend linguistical concepts to my resum&#233;, based on my (perceived) ability to read (understand) and write (produce) some technology: fluent, literate, conversant, and familiar.</p>

<p>Most interviewers have commented favorably on that approach, although I have had to explain it more often than not.</p>

I think I'm going to steal that idea. I split my skills into similar categories, they just didn't sound as impressive. I still think I need an extra category for "acronyms beginning with 'X' I call bullshit my way through", is there a proper linguistical term for that?

<p>
Just mark that down as "fluent", just like the next guy.</p>

"Perl/CGI<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... PHP". Is he implying he knows "Perl/CGI", or has used Perl only for CGIs? Does he not think PHP is CGI? Is CGI just implied with saying PHP and needs to be specified with Perl?

At least he didn't commit the sin of writing "C/C++", though calling HTML a language is almost as bad.
<br> <br>
The real shock to me is that somebody would claim that they had working knowledge of so many disparate technologies.

Yeah, I'm always skeptical when too many odd combinations are listed.  I think those resume sections need to be targetted for the job under consideration.  If the job was such that all those Java, Perl, XML skills are listed, why bother cramming in Dreamweaver, too?  I usually don't care if my programmers know MX or not.
