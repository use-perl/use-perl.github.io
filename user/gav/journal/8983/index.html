At first I really didn't like the way the screen looked. I was wondering if buying the 12.1" screen was a mistake after all. I tried 800x600 but that made things look really sucky. I fiddled about a bit with the anti-aliasing which made a bit of an improvement, but then I worked out the real problem. I had the screen titlted forward a bit too much. My only gripe at the moment is the "delete" key is "backspace" and "delete" seems to be missing. Why is "capslock" so big anyway? Does anyone really use it?

My next task of the day is to get some applications so I can start using this. I'm going to be sticking to free stuff for the next few weeks as until my pay cheque comes I'm feeling poor, after spending over $2000 in hardware this month, I should be frugal in something at least.

I've got a <a href="http://www.zipstorage.com/exfirdual35i.html">dual firewire enclosure</a> with two 20 gig drives that came from my old windows box. It was a very painless installation process, open case, screw in disks, connect power and IDE cables, connect power cord, connect firewire cable to iBook and then watch them get magically mounted. It's a great way to have access to all your old PC files and I'm very impressed in how easy it worked.
