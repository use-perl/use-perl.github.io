<p><p>Finally got round to watching "<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0289043">28 Days Later</a>" tonight. I really liked it, I'm a big fan of horror that doesn't need to use gore to hide the fact it's not scary.</p></p>

<h2>Zombies redone</h2>

I liked how they made zombies super fast instead of shambling buffoons. I really like zombie flicks (Living Dead series was great and I liked the Return of the Living Dead series for some reason as well).<br> <br>Sure I could punch holes in the story, but it was hooked together enough to be fun. In action flicks and such I just want the story to be internally consistent. It doesn't need to be possible just consistent. Which is why I don't like Episode 1. I didn't need an explanation for the Force. I just need to know it existed and whom it was strong with.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>Then again, I like to have nightmares. They are dreams that are very hard to forget.

I thought that, overall, this was a pretty good movie as well.  I think the "who are the real monsters" message near the end was a little overbearing and dull, though.
<p>
The one internal consistency problem I had with the movie was this - if these people are so damned enraged by the virus, why don't they attack each other?  But, other than that nitpick, pretty good flick.</p>

<h2>Ending</h2>

Apparently <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Movies/07/25/sprj.cas03.film.28.days.ap/" title="cnn.com">they've changed the ending</a cnn.com> since it came out.  I saw the less dark version, which was worth seeing.  I agree with you absolutely about restraint in use of on-screen, clearly shot violence (which usually ends up looking silly).  Goo and gore technology has ruined horror movies.

<p>A bit of goo can make a film though, for example <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0092610" title="imdb.com">Bad Taste</a imdb.com><nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
<p>I got to see both endings. I have to admit that I'm a sucker for a happy ending but I also liked the alternative - it ended with a really well done shot which seemed to fit the film better.</p>
