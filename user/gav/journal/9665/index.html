<p>So Christmas has passed and we're in the limbo time before the new year. Christmas was good, it's always nice to get together with family (though half my family is an ocean away) and get fat on turkey.
<p>
I'm been busy working on a e-commerce site, and churned out a fraction under a thousand lines of Perl in the last three days. I'm converting a site that used Java to static product pages (on <a href="http://store.yahoo.com">Yahoo Store</a>) and a Perl back end. It was originally developed with a pretty scary MS-SQL database by people who were crazy about normalization. As things are so normalized you need to do a join across three tables to get simple information like minimum order quantity or the title for a user. I've written a nice layer above this so I don't have to worry about the madness, even if it is a bit <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html">leaky</a> in places.
<p>
I'm going to be off to sunny <a href=" http://shorl.com/fyfrinytygryvi">Maui</a> on the 13th, so I need to do some shopping for summer clothes. I also need to get a spare battery for my iBook so I can watch DVDs (14 hours of flying!). I upgraded my NetFlix membership so I can have 8 out, so I will have plenty to keep me out of trouble. Hopefully my Amazon order will get here before I leave so I'll have some reading material too (I ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0156027607/">Solaris</a> by Stanislaw Lem).
<p>
I am a bit worried about the flight. My carry-on will include plenty of electronics: iBook (with spare battery), DVDs, CDs, Discman, headphones, my SLR (with extra lens and lots of film), etc. I'm sure they'll mark me for extra harassment.
<p>
I met a friend of a friend who was showing his indie (a word missing from the Microsoft Word dictionary!) film in the town hall on Friday. It's really given me some motivation to start learning how to use my 16mm camera and shoot some interesting footage. I all I now need is some spare time!
<p>
Anyway I'm off to the cinema in a bit to see "<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0264464">Catch Me If You Can</a>" so I have to get moving.</p>
