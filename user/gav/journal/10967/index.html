<p><ul><br/><br/><li>Drank <a href="http://www.stella-artois.com/">Stella Artois</a></li><br/><br/><li>Watched a fantastic performance by Richard E. Grant in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0097531">How to Get Ahead in Advertising</a></li><br/><br/><li>Saw the <a href="http://www.kcot.net/">Ken Clark Organ Trio</a> play some magnificent blues, swing and jazz. Buy their cd or <a href="http://www.kcot.net/gigs.htm">go see them live</a> if you are in the area.  Ken plays the organ like a demon, pounding out some great bass lines on the pedals.</li><br/><br/><li>Drank <a href="http://absolut.com/">Absolut</a> and cranberry juice</li><br/><br/><li>Discovered that Appleworks 6 does not understand CSV files. What the fuck are Apple thinking? Attempted to install <a href="http://porting.openoffice.org/mac/ooo-osx_downloads.html">OpenOffice</a>. Couldn't get it to run. Is there a decent spreadsheet or datatabase application for OS X that can work with simple CSV files (and doesn't cost a lot of money)?</li><br/><br/><li>Started hacking on some kind of Yahoo-ish web-enabled-database-thingy to try to counter the fact that I've got bookmarks distributed over half a dozen browsers on three machines and I'll probably never find anything again anyway. Decided that this would be a good place to try and make a definative list of slides from perl talks from shambles that is my bookmarking attempts.</li><br/><br/><li>Installed <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/camino/">Camino</a>. Liked it.</li><br/><br/><li>Thought I was rich when I checked my bank balance. Realised my rent cheque hasn't cleared. Still in fear about the at least $4000 I owe in taxes. Must call <a href="http://www.hrblock.com/">H&R Block</a> tommorow.</li><br/><br/><li>Washed the clothes I took on the trip I got back from two weeks ago. Made some attempt to tidy up, mainly in a panic because I lost the remote for the cable box. </li><br/><br/><li>Decided that $53/month is too much to pay for cable. Discovered that my bill will increase by $22 next month when I have to start paying for HBO. Also investigated getting rid of digital cable, I can either pay $13 and not get Cartoon Network/TLC/SCIFI or pay $43. Fantastic.</li><br/><br/></ul></p>

<br>We finally dumped cable a few months back. It's amazing how much more time you have when you only get two channels<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>It's a bit rough at first, but once you get past the withdrawl, it doesn't hurt anymore.<br> <br>-matt<br>

Funny you should mention your CSV spreadsheet woes, a friend of mine ran into this last week. <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/" title="versiontracker.com">Versiontracker</a versiontracker.com> is your friend. My friend found <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/moreinfo.fcgi?id=14066&amp;db=mac" title="versiontracker.com">BC Spreadsheet</a versiontracker.com>, which gets the job done, but not too fancy. I have not tried it myself, so I can't comment.
