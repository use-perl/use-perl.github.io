<p><p>I wanted to post this on <a href="http://www.axis-of-aevil.org/">Axis of Aevil</a> but since they don't have comments, I'll post it here, it might be helpful to somebody.</p>
<p>There are two secret tips I learnt about caulk. Firstly a wet finger (with kitchen roll to wipe it on) does wonders to make a nice smooth joint. When it comes to removing the stuff, if you take a razor blade and bend it into a curve it makes a fantastic tool for scraping it off.</p>

<p>A wet finger doesn't succeed the same way a good even bead does. I managed to get much of it to look nice except one corner which I ripped off and re-caulked. So, wanna come over an channel bob vila and fix my house?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  I'm <i>really</i> quite sick of painting, cleaning windows, etc. after 3 weeks of it.</p>

<p> I hung a new light fixture in the bedroom on sunday and I had to remove the old tape from the 1920s which also had some kind of pine tar-like stuff that had fossilized. In attempting to remove it I managed to stab myself good and proper with a sharp pair of scissors in the palm. The light looks good, my palm doesn't. I can't wait to be an apartment dweller<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<i>A wet finger doesn't succeed the same way a good even bead does.</i> <br> <br>Aha, but I beg to differ.  I just finished <a href="http://vek.perlmonk.org/cgi-bin/photo.pl?showpic=entrance_set.jpg&amp;section=house" title="perlmonk.org">tiling</a perlmonk.org> our bathroom.  Of course all the trim boards had to be removed and then re-attached/caulked/painted etc.  The ol' wet finger trick is a <b>life saver</b> - especially if you are as crap as I am in creating that sodding even bead<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>looks good<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Bob Vila whispered in my ear telling me that a moistened drinking straw works even better<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) </p>

I can't wait to be a house owner<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Just as soon as I can convince the bank to give me money and find a suitable place (neither is proving easy).
<p>
I think the main reason for moving is that I've spent the last year in an apartment with off white walls and it is driving me crazy!</p>

<p>I wouldn't mind owning a home either in downtown or outside of suburbia but owning a home in suburbia where crap amateurs have really done a bodgy job of keeping the place together isn't my cup of tea. It's better than some of the new houses I've seen slapped together but I have an innate loathing of suburbia which taints everything<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Owning an apartment in downtown where regular maintainence has occured on a regular basis over the last 100 years or so is far more appealing. Also, never underestimate the value of being able to move without the hassle of having to sell the house. If this longshoremen strike continues and the US goes to war soon I could be seriously fucked for selling it before we leave the country which would be very sub-obtimal.</p>
