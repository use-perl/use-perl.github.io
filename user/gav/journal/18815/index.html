<p><p>Using <a href="http://www.pubsub.com/REST/">PubSub's REST API</a> I have a little cronjob that makes <a href="http://www.estey.com/perl-news.html">a page full of Perl news</a> collected from the interweb.</p>
<p>Now and again there's something interesting but most stuff is random nonsense (though there's often some handy knitting news to keep me entertained) about how Perl is slow/ugly/write only/outdated etc and how PHP/Python/Ruby/Java is going to take over the world. These amuse me most. Mainly there seems to be masses of evangelical Java programmers who are so insecure in their choice of language they must sneak a snide comment about Perl into every 7th paragraph.</p>
<p>I like it when they have <a href="http://www.delusions.de/daily/archives/2004/05/17/messed-up-good/">Messed up good</a> trying to replace 1000 lines of Perl:</p>
<blockquote><i>I have lost the grasp of what everything is doing. I have already spent two days in a row just refactoring some of the stupidities I have implemented. I am pretty sure that my threads are probably out of control, I have non-reproducable errors creeping up every once in a while. The web interface is nowhere near finished and I had planned on being done this wednesday. Alas, there is no real deadline. Fifth error by the way.
<br /><br />
I have started trying to improve, myself, my methods and of course my project. But by now itÃ¢â¬â¢s around a 100 classes big Ã¢â¬Â¦. I donÃ¢â¬â¢t really no where to continue.</i></blockquote>

Wow it would be interesting to see tha original 1000 line perl script.  You have to wonder what kind of CPAN modules the script used and what percentage of the code he's writing we normally don't think twice about because it just works.
