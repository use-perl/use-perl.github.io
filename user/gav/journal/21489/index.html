for to renew our subscription.  My wife and I suspended our account while renovating our house and moving into it (which I handled like a bad project manager, underestimating everything<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>We were just talking tonight about how we might be ready to renew our subscription.<br> <br>-- Douglas Hunter

<h2>The truth...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/KM/">KM</a> on 2004-10-27T14:50:56</h3>
"Since the price increase, we heard from a lot of customers. We basically ignored that, since we knew you would keep paying it anyways. But, since Blockbuster came out with the same service plus a free in-store rental per month, for 2 bucks cheaper a month.. we decided we needed to stop losing market share and have now become 2 bucks cheaper than them.<br> <br>No wait, sorry. Forget that. It's really because we listened to you, our customer."



<h2>Blockbuster</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/KM/">KM</a> on 2004-10-28T14:32:17</h3>
FYI.. Blockbuster lowered their price to $17.49, and now has two free in-store game/video rentals a month.<br> <br>However, they can't seem to figure out how to make www.blockbuster.com and blockbuster.com go to the same place.
