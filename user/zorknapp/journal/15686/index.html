<p>You know, since I haven't written since the little black bear appeared on campus, my reading public has most likely been wondering if I had perhaps been EATEN by Mr. Bear.
<p>
I can safely say, FEAR NOT, my fellow humans!  The bear did not make the treat out of me it may have wanted to.  No bear bites on my bottom.  Yet.
<p>
Since August, I've been both lazy and busy.  Lazy about writing, and busy with work.  The combonation of the two of course conspires to keep me away from blogging.  This perhaps is not the <a href="http://www.blogforamerica.com/">Blog for America</a>, but the blog for lazy bastards.
<p>
Hearing Mr. Jjohn's <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jjohn/journal/">music</a>, along with songs I played on quite a bit of time ago, has made me realize that I really haven't written anything musical in recent times.  The creative bug just hasn't been biting.  I have had opportunities to play music with other people.  That has been fulfulling, but I need to do more.  I have been picking up the bass more in the past few weeks than I have before then, in order to get the strings back under my fingers.  There is just more pulling me away from the music now than in the past.
<p>
My hope is after my wedding in February, that I'll be able to devote more time to non-wedding related activities.  Honestly though, the wedding hasn't been what is taking me away from being creative, it's just the lack of motivation to be creative.  
<p>
I've been reading much more, and I'm beginning to get the writing bug again.  However, I don't seem driven to do anything about it.  My ideas are half formed, and I find it difficult to come up with the dramatic twists that would make certain ideas more compelling.  More to think about with these ideas.
<p>
On a totally other subject, I have seen <a href="http://www.elfmovie.com/">"Elf"</a> and <a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/">"Matrix Revolutions"</a> over the weekend.  "Elf" was much better than the third installment of the Matrix.  The battle scenes in the third Matrix were tremendous, but the plot/characterizations left much to be desired.  "Elf," on the other hand, was funny, entertaining, and although the sweet ending at the end was fairly predictable, it's a friggin' Christmas movie, it's supposed to have a happy ending.
<p>
Now, for happy endings, here comes <a href="http://www.lordoftherings.net/index.html">"Return of the King"</a>!  Can I mention how much I'm salivating for this film.  In fact, jjohn, my fiance, and myself, along with some others, will be attending the <a href="http://www.theonering.net/features/newsroom/files/102003_trilogytuesday_aftermath.html#part1">"Trilogy Tuesday"</a> massive showing of "Fellowship," "The Two Towers," and "Return of the King" all in a row.  
<p>
Some have asked me if seeing three movies, and long ones at that, in a row will be overwhelming.  I say, "Yes, but it's supposed to be overwhelming!"
<p>
Alright, enough yakkin for now, I'll try to write on a daily basis for now, and I won't just whine about being uncreative.
<p>
Cheers!</p>
