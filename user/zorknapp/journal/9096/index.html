<p>Hello!  I haven't written in a bit, mainly because this week has been hectic with work.  I finally got my new computer at the end of last week, and I've been adjusting my work habits to take advantage of the expanded power at my fingertips.
<p>
We're nearing the end of the academic term here.  Thanksgiving break starts on Wednesday afternoon, and when students come back, there's only about 1.5 weeks left.  Exams are on people before they know it.  I've been telling my staff that while they're working on exams, I'll be working on their performance appraisals.  Fun stuff...
<p>
I talked with jjohn on the phone last night, and I made a prediction that if Osama bin Laden is caught by US forces, he may be the first execution broadcast on television.  So, you heard it here first. 
<p>
Personally, I don't go in for the death penalty.  I'm more for locking someone in a small room for life, and sliding food into them under a small hole in the door.  No human contact, no interaction, no sunlight.  Is that more cruel and unusual than the death penalty?  Personally, I don't think so, but hey, what do I know.
<p>
I was initially told that when my computer got switched, my music files would not get transfered.  However, they're all on here, so I get to continue to listed to Ben Folds, Yes, Pete Townshend, Dana Gould, King Crimson, Lewis Black, George Carlin, and the other cd's that I had transfered to the IMac I had.
<p>
It's the holiday time of year again, and have you all made your wish lists for this year?  I have, and it's DVD heavy.  The Babylon 5 box set, the 4 disc Fellowship of the Ring set, the Law and Order season 1 box set, and perhaps some others.  I tend not to put cd's on my holiday list, because I tend to listen to some more obscure artists, and it's just easier to buy those myself.
<p>
My stepsister, brother, and I have decided not to do gifts amongst ourselves this year, which makes the holidays so much easier.  I'm pretty much done with my shopping, although I do still have to get something for my dad.  He has yet to offer me some suggestions, but I'm sure they're coming soon.  They better!
<p>
I just finished reading Kiln People, the new novel by David Brin.  If you're interested in a science fiction detective story, I recommend it highly. 
<p>
Okay, I think that's enough for today.  Sometimes I feel like I'm writing a bit like Larry King's column in USA Today.  Very rambling, whatever comes to the top of my head.  But hey, it's my log, I can cry if I want to. 
<p>
Cheers!</p>
