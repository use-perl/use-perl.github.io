<div class="span8">
<p>So, I was walking around campus a few weeks ago, and saw a squirrel.  Then, shortly after that, I saw some crows standing around.  Because my mind may choose to wander down unfamiliar, or frankly, odd paths, I thought to myself:
<p>
"Hmm. Squirrels and crows are about the same size.  I wonder which animal would win in a fight."
<p>
The crow has the advantage of flight, but are its beak and talons/claws enough to overcome the tenacity of an enraged squirrel?  Could a crow pick up a squirrel, and drop it on a rock, like some sea-birds do to crabs?
<p>
Could the squirrel, on its own, climb a tree, and attack from the air a crow feeding on the ground?
<p>
Does the advantage go to the attacker, whichever creature goes first, or is there some inherent ability in one animal or the other that would lend it the ability to achieve victory no matter the situation?
<p>
At first, I know you're thinking, "What a stupid question."  But, you're going to be lying awake tonight, or tomorrow, or sometime, thinking to yourself:
<p>
"A squirrel's teeth are sharp, but could they really get through the crow's feathers to the flesh below?"
<p>
"Yes, the crow can dive bomb a squirrel, but how sharp is that beak, really?"
<p>
Your thoughts, ideas, and strategies are encouraged.  I think I have the beginnings of a book here.
