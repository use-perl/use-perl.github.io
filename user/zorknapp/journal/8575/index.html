<p>It's getting near the end of the day here.  Some of you may be wondering what goes on during my day.  
<p>
Today, I started off my morning with a staff meeting, of the professional staff in the Office of Residential Life.  It's not terribly long, but I wasn't able to get food before it, so that's no fun.

My morning consisted of meetings with 2 of my staff members, and one resident who had roommate issues.  Much of my time with students is spent talking about the problems people have.  I'm like Mr. Wolf in Pulp Fiction.
<p>
I solve problems.
<p>
The afternoon was filled with more meetings, with students and other professionals.  I met with one of the deans here, to get a better sense of how he goes about doing his job, and I met with a student, who was looking for funding to start a women's discussion group in her building.  
<p>
I'll get more specific about some of this as time goes on.  Today was a day of not really being productive personally, but more about helping others be productive.
<p>
Cheers, I'm off...</p>
