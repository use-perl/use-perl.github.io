<p>This is a very exciting day!  I've finally got the Babylon 5 season 2 DVD's in the mail!  
<p>
This is a show I have only just gotten into.  I actually bought the first season DVD's, and have watched them all.  I can't wait to see some questions answered on this set that have been plaguing me since the first viewing, such as:
<p>
-Whatever happened to that loveable scamp, Jinxo, who worked on all 5 Babylon Stations?
<p>
-Will there be any more run-in's with that arch criminal, the Preying Mantis?
<p>
-I need more of Mutai, and I need it NOW!!!!
<p>
-I certainly hope we get this whole assination thing over with quick.  I don't think it's going to be that important to the show...
<p>
-I want to see more of Londo's cool tentacles!  He's like a squid man, but on land!
<p>
-What will Delenn turn into?  I think she's just taking a long nap, but some others are telling me that she's changing into something.  I think they're getting distracted from the main storyline, but what do I know?
<p>
-I don't know about you, but I think there's more to this Dilgar plot than meets the eye... 
<p>
-Will Franklin kill any more kids?
<p>
-The Psi Corps seems like a distraction from the main stories, these great one time characters that come around (except for that Morden guy, he's creepy, I don't like him).  Walter Checkov does an okay guy playing him, but I can tell that his russian accent creeps through into his voice every once in awhile.  I never realized that it would be hard for someone to keep up an American accent.
<p>
You know, I feel jealous of all of you who got to watch the show in its first run.  You already know the answers to all these questions, while I still have to discover them.  
<p>
I'm a bit puzzled though, by something on the cover of this box set.  There's a picture of someone who looks like that guy who played Scarecrow on some doofy show back in the 80's on the cover.  Maybe it's just a really bad picture of Michael O'Hare, but I'm not sure....
<p>
Happy viewing to all, and as the Vorlons say, "Keep on Truckin!"</p>

<p>The interesting thing about Babylon 5 is that the story you think it is isn't the real story.</p>



<h2>You forgot some important people, Zorky</h2>

Other plot threads worth noting:
<ul><br/><br/>  <li>Security officer Welsh.  What's the deal with all the bald guys in security.  This can't be a coincidence.</li><br/><br/>  <li>Vir Cotto's annoying relatives.  Surely, JMS is going to introduce us to Vir's uncle, right?</li><br/><br/>  <li>I need to see the homeworld of the "sac" people.  Who are these freaky aliens that would rather their kid die than be treated by science?  Are they part of the League of Non-Aligned Worlds?  Glad we don't have freaks like that on Earth!</li><br/><br/>  <li>Wow! I can't get enough of Mimbari poetry!  I hope more bonehead poets drop by the station in Season 2!</li><br/><br/>  <li>The "Ikarrans" were a powerful alien race that created wicked cool bio-tech weaponry, but that ep was way too scary.  I hope there isn't more of that creepy organic tech in future eps.</li><br/><br/>  <li>"Parliment of Dreams" showcased the religious beliefs of aliens and humans.  I hope they do this every season.  More drunk Londo please!</li><br/><br/>   <li>Col. Ari Ben Zayn is one bad mofo!  When things go south on B5, I know who to call!  Get in line, hippy!</li><br/><br/>   <li>That whole "great machine" thread was SO <i>Forbidden Planet</i>.  Why the hell was that a two parter?  Enough with the homages to sci-fi classics.</li><br/><br/>    <li>The best part about B5 is that even though the station is manned by the military, Sinclair skillfully uses diplomacy to get out of sticky situations.  After all in the premier ep, one tiny explosion sent the station careening off axis.  I can't imagine B5 in a sustained firefight with really powerful warships.  I'm sure the Earth Alliance will install more powerful engines so that B5 can make fast getaways from hostiles.</li><br/><br/>    <li>I love the war paint on the star furies!    I beat we'll see some pretty tricked-out paint jobs in the future!</li>
