<p>Hello!  I'm heading down to NJ tonight, to go to the NEARFest concert I have mentioned in past journals.  A rocking time will be had by all, I'm sure.
<p>
Speaking of rocking, I saw Peter Gabriel a week ago today.  Another great show!  For an old dude, Gabriel can get out there and put on a show with energy and focus.  
<p>
On the work front, I'm going to be moving to a different area of campus for this coming academic year.  I've been tapped to run the college's residential program that brings faculty and students together in the residence halls.  It should be a fun time, although moving is always a bit of a pain in the butt.  I figured out last night that since 1996, I've moved 7.5 times.  
<p>
The .5 is from when, at my last job, I moved, but it was to a different apartment in the same buildling.  It's a move, but wasn't a huge one.
<p>
So, all is well in the world of Zorknapp.  Hope all is going well with you in the world of Perl out there...
<p>
I'll be back on Tuesday, and I'll be sure to write up a review of the NEARFest for you all.  </p>

The band I used to work for, <a href="http://www.gep.co.uk/iq/" title="gep.co.uk">IQ</a gep.co.uk> have played there a few times and having nothing but good things to say about it. Great music, great people and a great time.
<p>
Have fun<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
