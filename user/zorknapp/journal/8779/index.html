<p>Sometimes, when I sit down to write this little log, I feel that I'm going to be repeating myself a lot.
<p>
For the sake of argument, if you are reading this, you can safely assume that I've spent part of this day:
<p>
1.  Meeting with my staff
<p>
2.  Eating
<p>
3.  Organizing schedules/room/lounge reservations
<p>
I'm going to try to use this space for more deep thinking, exploring areas that might be useful to have some written thought processes out there in the world.  Or, I'm just going to spout off about whatever comes to mind.
<p>
So, with that, here's my deep thoughts for today.  
<p>
It's election day, and I hope you've all gone out to vote.  As I walked to the polling place today (the local high school), I reflected on this tradition, the idea of having a say in how we get to run the town, state, country, whatever.  I really do think that voting is important.  We can hem and haw over whether we think our vote "counts" or not, but if you don't vote, it's sure to not count.
<p>
Also, in this post-9/11 world, voting is perhaps one very obvious way we are different from those who would choose to fly planes into buildings.  We choose who we vote for, and if the person who wins isn't our candidate, then that's okay, because we'll have time to throw the bastards out when the next election comes around.   We don't pick up guns, and storm the seats of government.  
<p>
Although, after the last Presidential election, I'm sure some were tempted... 
<p>
I feel like I'm not getting to the crux of what I'm thinking, about the differences between our system and others.  I don't even know if it's relevant today.  But I do feel, that anyone who was moved by what happened on 9/11, and still doesn't vote, they need to think long and hard about what happened.  Because the attacks were about wanting to destroy the fundamentals of our way of life, and that doesn't mean that the attack was only aimed at economic or military targets.  The attacks were meant to produce fear, and fear brings inertia and inaction.  
<p>
Okay, soapbox mode off now... I need to think a bit more about this.  I'm forming a lot of thoughts in my head now, and I'm not sure how well thought through some of them are.  And that's how I'm different from our President.  I'll admit I need more time to think about something! ;)
<p>
Cheers!  Now, go vote, you bastards!</p>
