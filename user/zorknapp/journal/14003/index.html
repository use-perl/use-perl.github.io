<p>It's been a few weeks since the last entry for me in this journal.  I could claim busyness at work, but let's be honest, it really doesn't take much time at all to do these daily blogs.  I'm just inherently lazy about writing, and I'm coming to terms with that.
<p>
There, I've come to terms with it now.
<p>
Anyway, since my last installment, I've continued to get more settled into the new apartment with my fiancee, we've done some wedding registry work, and I've seen a couple good/middling/bad movies.  They break down thusly:
<p>
Terminator 3:  Better than I thought it would be.  The ending isn't as happy as it could have been, which is a good thing.  It was a surprisingly satisfying film, perhaps because my expectations were so low.
<p>
Tomb Raider 2:  A dopey movie, that had no real purpose other than to show off that Angelina Jolie can act badly, even with an Academy Award to her name.  I know it's not to be taken seriously, but it just wasn't that believable, much like a bad James Bond movie.  
<p>
Johnny English:  Fun, although a bit thin on the plot.  The movie also shows that even the cultured English think getting rained on by poo is funny.
<p>
American Wedding:  Another surprise for me.  Very funny, in a sick/crude way.  I enjoyed every minute of it, although I thought the jokes could have been tied together with a plot that made a bit more sense.  But hey, what do I know...
<p>
On the music front, I received my copy of Peter Gabriel's Encore Series from the Mansfield, MA show, which I attended with my fiancee and jjohn.  A cool show, and it's even cooler to have a great clean copy of the audio from the show.  What I would like to see in the future is DVD's of shows like this, since most shows at summer sheds like Great Woods/Tweeter Center have cameras running for the punters on the lawn.  Can it be that much harder getting the video recorded of a show like this, along with the audio?  Perhaps some techies out there can correct me on this. 
<p>
Can I also mention that one of the joys of doing this blog here, as a "non-techie," is reading blogs like jjohn's, where I hear about these big issues in the computer programming world that I wouldn't even know existed if it weren't for me coming here to check out blogs every day (even if I don't write as much as I should).
<p>
I also know that I really should put more links in here than I do, but that turns too much into work for me.  I only do it in instances where there's a real need for it.  If someone wants to look up the Peter Gabriel Encore Series, they can google it themselves, that's what I say!  
<p>
My work now is consisting of a lot of writing, in order to generate a manual for our office, along with preparing for our student staff training in September.  Busy, but not hectic.
<p>
That's all for now.
<p>
Tally Ho!
