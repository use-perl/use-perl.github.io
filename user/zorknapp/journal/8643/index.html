<p>Writing and lunch, two activities that always go together, except when they don't.
<p>
First off, thank you for the comments that I've recevied already on the weblog.  I appreciate the comments, both from jjohn and others.  Do I have one of the most thankless jobs on campus, being in Residence Life?  In some ways, sure.  We have to deal with situations that most people don't run into in their daily routine, like people taking dumps in showers, riots on campus, conflicts amongst roommates, health and safety issues, and whatever else is out there. (All of those items I list, I have had to deal with in my professional career, and more.)
<p>
On the other hand, it's not like someone is forcing me to stay in this career.  I enjoy the majority of interactions I have with my residents, with my co-workers, and others in my work life.  Generally, education is able to get through ups and downs in the economy with a minimum of layoffs.  Not that we're immune from economic crises, but generally they hit us a bit less harshly than others.  Also, I get to live on campus for free, with my lovely fiancee, and I get a meal plan, so I don't have to pay for meals on campus.  Not a bad deal at all.
<p>
A comment I read mentioned people hacking into computer systems on campus.  We had an issue last week with the campus internet connection being slow, because 3 student machines on campus were accounting for about 75% of the traffic, with file sharing.  The tech people thought that perhaps some of the computers were being hacked without the knowledge of the owner, but who knows.  All I know now is that the connections are back up to speed.
<p>
I have to go finish lunch now... Perhaps I'll write more later, but if not, I'll see you tomorrow... 
<p>
ps-Just some mandatory computer content:  We're switching from Macs to Dells over the next few months.  </p>
