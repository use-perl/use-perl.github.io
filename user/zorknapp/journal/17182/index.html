<p>So, there's all this hoopla about Janet Jackson's boob being exposed during the Super Bowl.
<p>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3453855.stm">Photos of boob here.</a> 
<p>
There is a lot of clamoring happening to have an "investigation" into this exposure, and of course, cries of the "children" being hurt by this.
<p>
All this during a game of pummeling, hitting, and focused violence.  I'm sure that's not damaging to children at all, it's SPORTING!!!!
<p>
This is just another example of how much some Americans hate their own bodies.  We can't see a breast on TV, because it'll cause some sort of moral decay.
<p>
I would gather that most humans on the planet have seen a naked breast at some point in their life, and yet somehow, society hasn't collapsed.
<p>
Strange, that.</p>

<p>I think that I as the parent would rather control when/if/how my children are exposed to such things. I happen to believe that what she did was immoral righfully banned.</p>

<p>Context is everything my friend.</p>

I agree.  It is not that I have a problem with breasts -- far from it! -- but I want control over what I see, and what my children see.  Of course, I had the common sense to realize than an MTV halftime show -- regardless of nudity -- would be inappropriate for my family, so we watched Winged Migration on DVD instead.  On one level, damn, if you're watching MTV, serves you right.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>But still, it was clearly wrong <em>because it was unexpected</em>.  It is not about which is worse, nudity or violence.  It is about parents being able to make the decisions about what their kids are exposed to (and adults controlling what they themselves are exposed to<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I was watching the game with my parents-in-law, and I am quite sure my mother-in-law wouldn't have wanted to see it) and as there was no real warning, they did not have that choice.<br> <br>If there was a real level of informing the viewer beforehand, I am sure there would not be nearly as significant an outrage.<br>

No offence taken.  My point is that, why is this even an issue?  I find that the issue with children seeing breasts, or skin of any type, is, to me, less of an issue of watching a game where people are engaged in acts of violence.
