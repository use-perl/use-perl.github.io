<p>Hello journal friends, hope all is well in your segment of the world today.  It's semi-sunny and nice here in New Hampshire.  We're still working with students here, as the residence halls don't close until next week.  Exams are happening now for the students, and it's great to not have to take any tests myself.
<p>
Right now, I'm waiting until next week to see if I will get a position here at the college that would be a nice promotion.  The limbo of patience is sometimes easy to slip into, and other times, it's a sticky wicket with which to deal.  I'd say that this is somewhere in between.  In my interview, I did as well as I believe I could.  I feel more relaxed now than I did before the interview.  I know that I've done all I can do to show that I'm the best person out of the other two internal candidates.
<p>
We'd all be good workers, but I believe that I'd be better.  Of course I would, or else why apply for it?
<p>
Anyway, I hope to have some news on this by the middle of this coming week.  At least then, I'll know one way or another.
<p>
Other than that, life is progressing nicely.  I'm traveling to <a href="http://www.mvol.com/">Martha's Vineyard</a> in July, my dad and stepmother have rented a house for a week there.  It'll be nice to go and relax there for awhile.
<p>
If you haven't yet, you should all find any comedy by <a href="http://www.danagould.com/">Dana Gould</a>.  He's a funny guy! </p>

I am leaving the Cape Cod area next week, I will miss you!<br> <br>What does a Zorknapp look like, anyway?  How many appendages?  Do you need supplemental breathing tanks in Earth's atmosphere, or certain parts of it?

If you want to see what a Zorknapp looks like, go to  <a href="http://www.aliensaliensaliens.com/" title="aliensaliensaliens.com">A3</a aliensaliensaliens.com> to check out Zorknapp's page.
<p>
Of course, that Zorknapp pic is not actually me, it's someone pretending to be Zorknapp.</p>

Yes, I have seen that, but I am unconvinced abstract art is a good way to convey details.  Perhaps a difference of our respective cultures?  When you pay for groceries on your planet, do you just sorta estimate?<br>
