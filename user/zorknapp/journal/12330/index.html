<p>So, I get to meet with someone today at 2pm.  It's a meeting to talk with a student about why they didn't get a student staff position for the coming year.  
<p>
It's really not going to be a bad meeting at all, but it is one of those times when you have to rationalize why someone didn't get hired for a position.  The simple fact is that we have too many qualified people for a limited number of positions.  It's a microcosm of the bigger issue facing many job searchers today.  
<p>
Other than that, it's a simply beautiful day today here in sunny New Hampshire.  My fiancee and I have our dance lesson later today, and I may be heading down to Boston for the day on Saturday.  I will be chaperoning a school trip to the big city, but other than making sure everyone gets back on the bus, I don't think I have any real responsibility.  I'll find out for sure later on.  
<p>
I have been playing an awful lot of <a href="http://www.firaxis.com/smac/">Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri</a> recently.  In fact, I just installed the expansion pack, Alien Crossfire, a few days ago, even though I bought it a few years back.  I enjoy these "god" games, they're terribly addictive for my personality.  If I could get a job just playing these games, I'd do it.  That's why sometimes I just stop playing the games for months at a stretch.  Otherwise, I get too sucked into the game itself.
<p>
Okay, I'm off to read the file for the meeting now.  Enjoy the day, wherever you are.</p>
