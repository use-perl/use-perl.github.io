<p>Ah, it's Friday.  I'm listening to a great comedy CD by a guy named Stephen Lynch.  He's a musical comedian, which I usually don't like, but this guy has talent.
<p>
Fridays at work are usually pretty laid back.  I've had some one on one's with my staff members, checking in with how they're doing, and how their floors are doing.  Are people getting along with each other?  Are classes overwhelming?  No one's smoking up in the halls?  Fun stuff...
<p>
I'm heading into Boston for the weekend, to get away from campus for a bit, and to also hang out with friends.  We'll probably watch Farscape, eat bad food, and other sundry bad things.  Also, I'll be most likely heading to a 12 hour Halloween movie marathon at the Coolidge Center cinema on Saturday night.  Granted, I'll be tired afterwards, but hey, who cares? 
<p> 
An amusing part of my job is tracking damages in the residence halls, and getting people to take responsibility for the damages that occur.  Usually, there's basic stuff, like trash in the hallways, garbage strewn everywhere.  Then, we get the nasty stuff, like people missing the toilet, dumping in the shower stalls, or urinating on the counters and floors, basically anywhere but the urinal or toilet.
<p> 
You'd think that most college students, even under the influence of alcohol, would be able to tell the difference between a toilet and a shower stall, but I guess the youth of today haven't been able to make that distinction.
<p>
In the world of the arts, one of my faboo bands is Yes.  They're touring now, and are playing in Durham, NH on November 7th.  So, all you techy-Yesfans out there should get your tickets now.  Run, don't walk!
<p>
Okay, I've rambled enough here for today.  Enjoy the weekend, and rock on...

</p><p>What is it with you and your rules, man! You're always getting heavy on me not to do this,
or not to do that. What's your problem, man! Who made you the final arbiter of what <em>is</em> and what <em>is not</em> a toilet? Why don't you get a pull-through with a Christmas tree and leave us creative types alone. I can see a million for all kinds of stuff.
</p><p>DON'T PUT ME IN YOUR BOX, MAN!</p>

<p>you have one of the most thankless jobs on Campus. You have to also watch out for the wannabe hacker types who think they're sneaky and steal cat5 ports for their little war3z box they think noone knows about...well, until a large company sends the cops over to the Campus to arrest the little wanker. Ah, a wistful sigh, those were the days.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I miss academia as even if it didn't pay well and often frustrating is was never dull.</p>

<p>Welcome Zorknapp. I have been an A3 fan for a while now. Nanu Nanu.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
