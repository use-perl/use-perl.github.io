<p>My apologies for being away so long from the land of Blog.  I will do my best to be sure to book tours here more often.  I like to visit, but I'm inherently lazy, so I don't jump at the chance to write as much as I should.  
<p>
Since my last captain's log, I've been to a student affairs conference in Minneapolis, MN.  At first, upon taking a taxi from the airport to the hotel in downtown Minneapolis, I thought the city would be quite a pit of despair.  Upon further review, Minneapolis isn't that bad of a place.  Decent restaraunts, some bookstores, and better weather at the time than New Hampshire was getting.  How could I go wrong?
<p>
Of course, after being in Minneapolis, I had to go over to Iraq, to help liberate Iraqis from their oil.  Good times.
<p>
Then, after that, I made my way back to New Hampshire, where I have been plowing my way through work.  That's another reason why I haven't written so much.  Traveling and work.
<p>
Jumping back to Minneapolis for a second, have any of you been to conferences where the only food available within easy walking distance is at the conference center itself?  That's was the only real big negative about Minneapolis.  No other food except for snack bar burgers and dawgs at the conference center.  Not that I was complaining too much, I'm a carnivore as much as the next person, unless they're a vegeterian.  I would have liked a bit more selection or options though.  I eat enough at a cafeteria when I work.  
<p>
In fact, when I finish writing, I'm going to be going to the cafeteria to grab a bite to eat.
<p>
Next writing, I'll talk about the dance lessons I'm taking with my fiancee.  I'm pretending to be cultured. ;)
<p>
Tally ho, enjoy the warm/neutral/cold weather!</p>

<h2>Dance Lessons</h2>

My wife-to-be and I took dance lessons for about a year, so that we could dance a waltz together at our wedding.<br>Hate to say it, but I didn't enjoy it.<br>Hope you do; I was (am) never able to <i>loosen up</i>.
