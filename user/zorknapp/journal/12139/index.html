<p>It's a Monday, on one of my "off" weeks.  I try to schedule my meetings with my student staff, who I meet individually on a bi-weekly rotation, so that I'm busy one week, and lighter the next.  So, this is one of my off weeks.  The main work item I have to do are the end of year evaluations for my staff.  Fun stuff, I just need to sit down and write the damn things! 
<p>
Which is why I'm writing in the journal now.
<p>
I hiked a bit of the Appalachian Trail yesterday, a co-worker and I drove about 5 miles off campus, and walked the trail back into town.  We thought it would be downhill most of the way, but there was a section where we had to climb about 150 feet at a 30 degree or so angle.  Maybe this doesn't sound too bad to the mountaineers out there, but for me, it was a bit of a haul.  But, after the feelings of vomiting passed, it was good.  A great day for a walk outside.
<p>
For those of you into genealogy, I finally made the leap across the Atlantic, and have sent letters to some churches in Poland, trying to find information on the families of my great-grandparents on my mom's side.  I found some templates online to write letters in Polish, so I cut and pasted to my heart's content on Friday, and posted the letters on Saturday.  Of course, it may take up to a year or longer to hear back, but I'm a patient guy.  At least I finally sent the letters.
<p>
I also sent out today some letters to churches in NJ where some of my family went back in the day.  It'll be interesting to see what comes of those.  
<p>
I thought I would get more of a response to my humorous B5 journal entry before, but c'est la vie!
<p>
I have nothing much more profound to say now, so I think I'll get back to work now.  Bill Hicks is playing on the computer, so I will reflect and laugh soon...
<p>
More later...</p>
