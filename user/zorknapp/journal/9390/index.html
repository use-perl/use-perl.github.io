<p>Hello!
<p>
The end of the semester here is fast approaching.  Students are leaving, I'm checking rooms for people who are moving over the break, to make sure they're out, and generally just getting things done.
<p>
I've got 14 more evaluations of my staff to do, which need to be done by next Friday.  Shouldn't be that much of a problem, I simply need to sit down and do them.
<p>
I don't remember if I mentioned this, but I got a program accepted at the two major student affairs conferences going on in March 2003.  Unfortunately, I can only go to one of them, so I have chosen to go to the conference in Minneapolis.  I have never been there before, so I thought it would be an interesting place to see.
<p>
No news about the other job yet.  The more I think about it, the less I'm sure I want to go back to being at the same college I was at before coming here.  While the opportunity is great, perhaps there are other opportunities around the corner, which if I take this one, will disappear.
<p>
It's easy to talk myself out of anything. 
<p>
However, if the offer is good enough, assuming it's made, I'll just have to see how it feels in the moment.
<p>
I've been talking with one of my co-workers here about starting up a student affairs weblog site.  More to come as it develops, if it does. 
<p>
I'm off to an end of term holiday party here.  So long!</p>
