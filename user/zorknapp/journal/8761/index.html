<p>Has anyone else here been captured by the music of Ben Folds?  If you haven't, I recommend you pick up the recent live album of his, released just a few weeks ago.  Excellent.
<p>
Work since my last entry has been good.  Busy, which is why I didn't write.  I would like to write *something* every day, but I'm not in the discipline of that yet.  
<p>
I get to serve on our student staff appreciation committee here at the college.  It's something I honestly have little to no interest in.  Not because I don't think staff should be recognized for the hard work they do, but I do think the "institutional" recognition matters less than those little moments where a supervisor, or someone else simply says, "good job!"
<p>
But, in our lives, we have to do what we have to do, so I am a member of this committee.  I actually have yet to meet with the other members, but I will be doing so later this week.  Perhaps I can be subversive, and make recognition something a bit different than what res life folks usually take as normal.  The norm is to do things that allow residents of the buildings to leave little notes on staff members doors.  We prepare small slips of paper that residents then write messages on, and put them on the door.  Perhaps your high school did this, on special days, as fundraisers.  I know mine did.
<p>
Anyway, I really don't like this method of recognition, mainly because it sets staff apart from the rest of the residents of the buildings.  I think that a general apprecation of other residents could be useful, and maybe I'll do that on my own, where the recognition is not limited to the staff members.  Where students can drop these notes at other students doors, just for the sheer bloody fun of it... 
<p>
My day today has been, and will be mainly about getting ready for the rest of the week.  I'm keeping up on basic administrative tasks, and will be meeting with some of my staff members in one on one meetings later today.  Great fun, I love talking with my staff.
<p>
Saw two movies this weekend, Red Dragon, and Jackass.  Red Dragon was much better than Hannibal, but not as good as Silence of the Lambs.  Jackass was simple fun for simple people, and there are times I enjoy that.  You got a problem with it!  Good.
<p>
I think it's time for food.  Off to eat lunch now.  See you all tomorrow.</p>

I was just commenting today and yesterday about how much Ben Folds kicks bootay.  I am likely going to snag his new one, though I generally don't spend money on live albums.
