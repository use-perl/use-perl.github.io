<p>Hello!
<p>
It's been busy here, with approaching the end of the term.  Evaluations to write for student staff, prepping for the work we have to do while students are gone, and just general end of year work issues.
<p>
I've had an interesting opportunity drop into my lap.  I've been in contact with people at my last position, and it seems that the Director of Residence Life position there is open.  My friend has asked if I would be interested in having my name dropped into the pool of candidates, and I said, sure, why not?  I have nothing to lose by doing this.
<p>
Now, I have to see what will happen.  I have sent in my resume and cover letter.  However, I have committed to being in my present position through the academic year.  Therefore, if it was offered and I accepted, I would not be Director at the other college until June or July 2003.  
<p>
Of course, none of this may happen at all, so I could be thinking about this for no other reason than to make myself crazy.  But oddly enough, I have an "interesting" feeling about this.  Not good or bad yet, just interesting.
<p>
More reflections on this to come...
<p>
Cheers!</p>
