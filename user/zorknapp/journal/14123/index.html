<p>So, today on campus after lunch, I'm walking to the main Residence Life office, and what is happening on campus?
<p>
We had a bear on campus!!!!  A little black bear.  And when I say little, I mean as compared to other bears.  The beastie was probably as tall as me when it stood against a tree, and was bigger than the biggest dog out there.
<p>
I was excited, as I had heard stories of different wild creatures on campus, but hadn't seen any.  Last summer, there was a moose running around, and I missed it!  But now, I can safely say that I encountered a real bear, although at a distance.
<p>
My hope is that they tranquilized the bear, and can bring it back into the wilds of NH, but I don't know what procedure is.  I'll keep people updated as to the status of the bear.
</p>

<h2>My understanding</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjohn/">jjohn</a> on 2003-08-14T19:29:18</h3>
I thought the standing policy was to put the bear in the room of the Residence Life director who blogs about it.  When you go back to your room, you may want to knock first.



<h2>What a difference word order makes...</h2>

On one hand, a coed bear.  On the other, a bare coed.<p>Either way, college can be exciting!</p><p>John</p>
