<div class="span8">
<p>It's been awhile since I've written, not because I haven't had anything to write about, but because it has been a bit hectic up here in the land of the disappearing <a href="http://www.mutha.com/oldmanmt.html">Man in the Mountain</a>.  
<p>
I mentioned in one of my last journals that I had put in for a "promotion" here at the college, but unfortunately, it didn't work out for me.  However, now I have the opportunity to move areas on campus, and work in a different residential cluster.  
<p>
I'm going to be having more conversations with individuals over the course of this coming week, to see if this is something I really want to do.  I was asked to do this by my supervisor, which is never a bad thing.  It's good to be considered the "go to" guy, as long as I don't get taken advantage of in the process.  
<p>
This move would not entail more money, but it would involve different responsibilities, and perhaps a more visual role within the Office.
<p>
So, that's the work end of things.  But I'm sure you're saying, "Zorky, there's more to life than work.  What about fun things?"
<p>
Well, voice in my head, I'm going to see <a href="http://www.petergabriel.com">Peter Gabriel</a> this coming week, down in Massachusetts.  I'm also, at the end of the month, meeting up with one of my old college roommates to go to <a href="http://nearfest.com/nearfest/">NEARFest</a>, the Northeast Art Rock Festival, taking place in Trenton, NJ.
<p>
One of the headliners at this festival is <a href="http://seventhrecords.com/MAGMA/biomagmauk.html">Magma</a>.  They're a French band who sing all their songs in the invented language of Kobian.  So, it's going to be a rockin' time.
<p>
Keep on keepin' on.  More to come!</p>
