<p>Hello all!  I have returned from a week's vacation on Martha's Vineyard, and from moving apartments.  Pardon my absence in this time, I'm sure you were all wondering where I was.
<p>
I've decided that I don't really mind packing, or unpacking.  It's the physical act of moving boxes and other things that I don't really like.  Fortunately, the college had some movers who were able to transport most of my really heavy pieces of furniture, along with all the boxed books, cd's, dvd's, and various sundry items.  Now, the unpacking begins.
<p>
I enjoy not labeling the boxes, because then it's like your birthday every time you open a box!
<p>
"Wow, I didn't know I would get a box of CD's!  And I like all of them!"
<p>
It's a small joy, but I'll take what I can get...
<p>
Martha's Vineyard was tremendously enjoyable, in a very relaxing kind of way.  The great thing about going to MV is that if the weather is great, you can do a certain set of fun things, and if it's not, you can do something else that is equally as fun, just different.  
<p>
I got a sunburn on the beach, went out to eat quite a bit, wandered around Oak Bluffs, Edgartown, and some other locations, ate, went to Chappaquiddick (I probably spelled that wrong), and just generally relaxed.  
<p>
My dad and stepmother rented a house off of Old County Road, and the group was myself, those two, and my stepsister with her husband.  My fiance joined us on Friday for the weekend, as she had to work during the week. 
<p>
The friends of the family who used to own a house on the island now own a 55 foot yacht, which we visited often.  It was a great boat, and I like sitting on the water in something like that, even if we're just tied up to the dock.  There's something romantic about being on the water.
<p>
Now, it's back to the grind of work.  Not that it's really bad, but it is work.  I have to pack up my office belongings to move to my new work area, but I won't be totally moved until next week.  There's no rush to move, as we haven't hired someone for my old position yet.
<p>
More soon, once more happens. 
</p>
