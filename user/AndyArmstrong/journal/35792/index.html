<h1>Perl debugger: stop at a specific test number</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>I like data driven tests. The general pattern is a big array of test cases
and some driver code at the bottom that loops over the cases applying the same
assertions to each of them.</p>

<p>That's all well and good until you want to use the Perl debugger to step
through test #1967 of 2673. There's no good place to set a break point because
the driver loop will execute many times before it hits the test you want to
single step through. You can fake it like this:</p>

<pre>
if (Test::Builder->new->current_test >= 85) {
    $DB::single = 1;
}
</pre>

<p>Setting <code>$DB::single</code> to a true value makes the debugger break
at the following line. It'd be much nicer though to be able to set a magic
breakpoint in the debugger that'd stop at test #1967. Add the following code
to your ~/.perldb and that's exactly what you'll be able to do.</p>

<pre>
my @opts = qw( windowSize=30 );

if ( $] >= 5.010000 ) {
    push @opts, "HistFile='" . glob( '~/.perldb_history' ) . "'";
}

parse_options( $_ ) for @opts;

@DB::testbreak = ();

# Monkeypatch cmd_b (set breakpoint)
my $cmd_b = \&DB::cmd_b;
*DB::cmd_b = sub {
    my ( $cmd, $line, $dbline ) = @_;
    if ( $line =~ /\s*#\s*(\d+(?:\s*,\s*\d+)*)$/ ) {
        my %seen;
        @DB::testbreak = grep { !$seen{$_}++ }
          sort { $a <=> $b } ( split( /\s*,\s*/, $1 ), @DB::testbreak );
    }
    else {
        $cmd_b->( @_ );
    }
};

sub afterinit {
    $trace |= 4;    # Enable watchfunction
}

sub watchfunction {
    if ( @DB::testbreak && exists $INC{'Test/Builder.pm'} ) {
        my $next = Test::Builder->new->current_test + 1;
        if ( $next >= $DB::testbreak[0] ) {
            shift @DB::testbreak
              while @DB::testbreak && $next >= $DB::testbreak[0];

            my $depth = 1;
            while ( 1 ) {
                my ( $package, $file, $line ) = caller $depth;
                last unless defined $package;
                last unless $package =~ /^Test::/;
                $depth++;
            }
            $DB::stack[ -$depth ] = 1;
        }
    }

    return;
}
</pre>

<p>It modifies the debugger's 'b' (breakpoint) command so that you can
type:</p>

<pre>
  DB<1> b #1967
  DB<1> c
</pre>

<p>That'll run the tests until immediately after test #1966 and then stop,
ready for the setup to the test you're interested in. Regular breakpoints
still work as normal.</p>

<p>It's a little rough and ready. It decides which scope to stop in by
unwinding the call stack skipping past any packages that are called
<i>Test::*</i> - if your package naming doesn't work like that you'll have to
hack it about a bit.</p>

<p>If you have any improvements please let me know.</p></p>

Doesn't just plain "b Test::Builder-&gt;new-&gt;current_test &gt;= 85" work?<br>

<p>You can type that if you want, but I'd much rather type 'b #87'.</p>

<p>Yeah, it's not as generic as what you've written, but at the end of the day, I want a lot more people playing with the debugger so they can, er, debugger it.</p>

<p>Also, no - it doesn't work. You need a line number or subroutine name before the condidtion.</p>

<p>You can use:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>&nbsp; w Test::Builder-&gt;new-&gt;current_test &gt;= 87</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>which is nearly the right thing - but that halts inside Test::Builder - so then you have to hit r a few times to get back to the debuggee.</p>

<p>So it's sugar, it gets you to the right place simply, and in my case - because I have the debugger set up to take my editor to whatever file / line it stops on - it stops a lot of spurious windows containing the source of Test::Builder and whatever is layered between Test::Builder and the debuggee from opening.</p>
