There have been many journal posting about the talks (<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme/journal">acme</a>) so I shan't bother going into details. The conference was great - very well organised, Birmingham.pm have a lot to live up to. I really liked the dinner, to which everyone was invited, but this maybe hard to do in the UK, just because of the cost.
</p><p>
I've talked to people about all sorts of things; Multilingual website design, how crap SOAP is in general, someone would like authentication adding to SOAP::Lite::Simple, but from what I understand it's not supported in SOAP::Lite, although Jesse said it was possible, you have to do some very nasty hacks to implement it. I've learned about <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/pajas/XML-XSH2-2.0.2/">xsh</a> which allows you to walk an valid *ML document as if it was a directory structure. I also talked to Paul (pjcj) about integrating Devel::Cover with Test::Nightly.
</p><p>
One of the things I like about conferences is having a peak at what apps other people are using, I started
<a href="http://osx.oholic.info/wiki/doku.php">http://osx.oholic.info/wiki/</a> when a geek friend of mine first got his iBook and didn't know what apps to install. There are so many out there, but actually having someone recommend 'cool' apps is much easier than hunting for stuff  - especially when you're not searching for something specific. The best were <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium</a>, an IM client and <a href="http://www.kitzkikz.com/Sogudi">Sogudi</a> - a Safari plugin for short cuts to search results.
</p><p>
Modules to checkout if you are not aware of them:
SVK and Debug-ebug, Debug-ebug-HTTP were the best modules, and RunApp is interesting, Devel::Cover is cool, oh and if you are a CPAN author you need to check out <a href="http://cpants.dev.zsi.at/">http://cpants.dev.zsi.at/</a> - turn those red's green! (well if you can).
</p><p>
The Auction was great - I managed to spend the Euros I wanted to donate on stuff; 50 Euros for
acme's ability to wear orange at next years YAPC and 50 Euros on a signed conference cap - not sure what I'll do with that but as they say "it's all for a good cause" and I didn't spend 500 Euros on a T-shirt - which my wife was very happy about.
</p><p>
So.. see you in Birmingham 2007 - if not before!
</p></p>

It'll be good to see people in Brum anytime - Barbie does a terrific job organising socials and technical meetings on a regular Basis.<br> <br>
The Organisers did a fantastic job this year - everything from the welcome pack to the meal was
of incredibly high calibre. Top marks to Alberto and Jose for putting on an amazing event.
