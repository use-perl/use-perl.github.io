<p><p>In response to <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2006/05/mvc_frameworks_in_perl.html">Dave's</a> post about there being too many modules on CPAN that do the same thing, but no clear reason why a newbie to Perl would use one over the other; and my personal annoyance at some of the pointless perl modules (where Authors haven't looked at existing modules). I am proud to announce <a href="http://perl.cuckoo.org/">http://perl.cuckoo.org/ - The ultimate Perl module list</a>.</p>

<p>
If you are looking for a module, you should look at this site first, only then should you check CPAN.
</p><p>
I did consider trying to use Kwality ratings etc, but at the end of the day I think it's about the modules that you use in day to day life that matters.
</p><p>
So, enjoy - I'll update it from time to time, I may even add tags and other external URLs, but the main point it there is now a single place where I can point people who are starting out in Perl and let them know the basic modules they should be aware of.

which is why in the hell would a so-called newbie, who can't figure out module a from module b, know your website and/or trust it or, really, be arsed to bother to look at it? For years and years and years I have pleaded and pitched to deaf ears that people wanting to endorse certain modules should make Bundle::. People always do so much dumb stuff in the name of the noble and elusive 'newbie' when, if they gave it any thought at all, they might remember how it was to be one.

<p>The point was so that if someone asks me (or maybe others that know me) what modules they should be using I could point them to that site. I agree people new to perl are not going to just stumble across that site, but I'm hoping to make it into a talk for YAPC::EU and hopefully develope it further so that the content can be agregated if people want to stick it somewhere else.
</p> <p>
As for Bundle:: - I don't really see how that would help.
