<p><p>First off, I'd like to thank all those in organising the LPW, it was great! I got there for about 9:30, wondered round talking to various people. Dave Green did a really cool opening speach - with a song as promised.
</p><p>
It was good to see so many people I didn't recognise as well as so many I did. The word was obviously spread in the right places, I wonder what effect it will have on the London perl comunity and perl in London Companies.
</p><p>
The talk times seemed to work well, 30 mins for the learner track and 45 for the advanced. Enough to give you a taster and pointers where to look for more information.
</p><p>
I did my talk in the afternoon <a href="http://leo.cuckoo.org/projects/lpw/">Pages, results and caching</a> I was a bit nervious, this being my first talk to such a large group of people. I realised after (heignsight being such a wonderful thing) that I should have said I was just covering some aspects of the modules I covered and people should read the docs to find out more. I didn't have any questions asked when I asked, I don't know if this was because I explained it so clearly, or people didn't have a clue what I was talking about :)!
</p><p>
I guess I'll see how bad it was when the video comes out!
</p><p>
It did spark a few conversations after the talk, so at least two people were listening!
</p><p>
There was then much drinking, a dodgy Chinese and more drinking. 
</p><p>
I'm of for Xmas hols on Tuesday so have a great Christmas (or "Holiday Season" if thats your thing) and a fantstic New Year</p></p>
