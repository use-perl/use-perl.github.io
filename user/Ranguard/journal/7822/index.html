<p>Fantastic conference so far... interesting talks yesterday, practical web programming was a bit basic for me and then Scvhwerns Advanced Testing was.. umm.. broad ? Many topics and people talking.
<p>
Went to the bar near the hotel after and speant a few hours there. We tried to read the menu in German, then the bar man brought over and English version and we cheered.
<p>
Simon Wilcox and I left the others to it at about 10 and went to discuss how to redo the LPM website. We've come up with a load of cool stuff, but more on that when it's actually on a computer rather than a note pad! I do like discussing perl and approaches to development with other people of a similar technical level, you learn so much. We ended at about 1 in the morning heads still buzzing but needing sleep.
<p>
So far today, I did the Creating Dynamic Sites in a flash with TT, though I had mean't to be in the Imaging with Imager talk but got lost!
The talk was good though my only worry being that some people new to TT will think that the approach is the only way to do TT.
<P>
James Duncan did a good talk on Pixie which was impressive, both for the technical content and the fact James was really croaky from the nights merities (I'm in the room next to Grep so heard a lot of it!).
<P>
Just setteling on for Stows talk on SOAP which I have a feeling will be low on technical content (he didn't goto the speakers dinner so he could write the slides, and was in Greps room at 2 am, still not having written the slides) but high on humor / heckeling.</p>
