<p><p>Another London Perl Work shop survived and I was very impressed - I had been sligtly worried that the beginner track wasn't going to be interesting enough over all, but most of the talks we great or at least good.</p>

<p>Leon, Ben and I went for lunch, only to find we had 5 mins to eat it when it arrived as we had to be back on time for the afternoon talks as the presenter was using my laptop!</p>

<p>Leon and my talk about <a href="www.mightyv.com">MighTyV.com</a> seemed to go down well, I've put up a <a href="http://leo.cuckoo.org/projects/mightyv.pdf">PDF</a> version if anyone want's it.</p>

<p>
MJD was the talk after us - I now understand what all the fuss was about - he's a great speaker - covering the basics and even as someone who thinks of themselves as a seasoned programmer I learnt a huge amount</p>

<p>A few of us (probably about 80 or so - decanted to the pub and then after Fotangos money ran out moved on for food - Sea Urchin is a new one for me, and not something I'll rush out to try again - but interesting none the less :)</p>

<p>Due to popular demand Leon and I will be opening up the code for MighTyV in a little while - we need to do a bit of code cleanup before then</p></p>
