<p>I thought I should post an entry, just because I've never done it before, and because 2shortplanks mentioned me in his post and I didn't get highlighted (hmm, maybe you need to do something clever to get that to work, I guess I'll find out.
<P>
Popped into the London.pm meet last night, was good catching up with everyone after the new year. Usual sentiment that it was good to see acme back in one piece.
<P>
I've been working for foxtons and we're about to launch their new site (preview at <A HREF="http://www.foxtons.co.uk" target=_new>http://www.foxtons.co.uk/</A>) though I'm unhappy with a lot of it (bloody designers and their large quantities of JavaScript and poncy 3d icons).
<P>
I should be working on the servers now, though i've just realised that I've never really done much performance tuning at the level I need to now. So, interesting learning stuff but slightly late in the day as it launches on Monday! - though I have a get out that the company was a month overdue with specs and copy (well, I was still getting copy changes at 5:30 last night!). But then what's new!
<P>
Usng Apache::Registry for the main search, I really must look at doing a propper mod_perl handler one day.
<P>
Anyway, enough ranting, hope you weren't too bored.</p>

  There is no automatic highlighting of nicks, he would have needed to put a link around your name to highlight you.
