<p>Slightly late write up of my Birthday...
<br><br>
It was my Birthday last weekend.. and I got older.
Had a BBQ - of course on the one day in 2 weeks that it
was actually cold and not magically sunny.
<br><br>
There was much drinking and eating and people getting
to know each other (this is the first party I've had
in our new house - the old one being a large shoe box).
<br><br>
I would just like to point out that being given the
bumps at ages 28 is an odd experience, and my bruises
are just about healed! I do however think that I came
of better than the 10 people who decided to do it. I
thought they were about to give up after number 12, but
to get 'em credit they carried on!
<br><br>
I managed to get a nasty cold the day after
and have been off ill since (I hate being ill, especially when looking at a screen hurts your eyes!).
<br><br>
In perl related news I'm working on <a href="http://leo.cuckoo.org/projects/Business_vCard/">Business::vCard</a>
feed back welcome, more work still to be done before it's
ready for CPAN but it's almost there.</p>

<h2>Net::vCard</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjott/">jjott</a> on 2003-04-25T18:16:20</h3>
Check out Net::vCard - I have debated this module for a couple of months - and finally got off my butt and uploaded it to this space. Business::vCard was one of the candidate names but got nixed by the folks on Perl Module Authors mailing list. Net::vCard was the best alternative I came up with given it parallels Net::iCal which is its big cousin.<br/><br/>It too is incomplete but functions for what I need.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

I've just uploaded the version I finished off last night (before reading this), check it out and we can discuss joining forces!

A quick search on CPAN uncovers:
<ul>
<li> <b>Net::vCard</b> - Read and write vCard files (RFC 2426)</li>
<li> <b>XML::SAXDriver::vCard</b> - generate SAX2 events for vCard 3.0</li>
</ul>

<p>I suggest you check them out before uploading to CPAN.</p>

Cheers!

Arrrgg!!!<br> <br>
I had seen XML::SAXDriver::vCard and taked with the author, it works very differently.
<br> <br>
As for Net::vCard it wasn't there when I started the module a few weeks ago. I'll contact jjott to see if we can do some colabaration.
