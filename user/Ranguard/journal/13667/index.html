<p>Lots of other people have commented on what's been happening so I won't go into detail. Lots of good talks.
<p>
Was very good to see the over view of XML modules and SAX as I've played with a lot of them, but my general approach was just to try different modules until something worked, but I feel more confident in choosing the right module for the job now. I still hate UTF-8, but realise it's somethng I'm going to have to understand more and get used to using.
<p>
As usual the best part of YAPC is talking to people about what they are doing, talking through ideas, the CPANTS BOF was interesting for example, and Visser persuaided me to go to his talk about using wxPerl and creating perl Applications as I can already see several places I could use this at work.
<p>
The Tequiela - ummm, I mean Siesta talk it about to start, you'll understand my confustion over the title later on!
<p>
Once again I am convinced that where there not this wonderful community I could not be the programmer I am today, and even if I was, it wouldn't be half as much fun.</p>
