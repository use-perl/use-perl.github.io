<p><p>So it's that time of year again where the internet steps in to make my life a whole lot easier - Xmas shopping, and on the whole it just works, you find stuff and you give your credit card details, and it gets delivered</p>

<p>Now this year I wanted to buy something for my brother, so used one of those price comparison sites (which are usually rubbish as you often can't order by price and more!), and found the store I wanted to order from. I go through the whole register process and then go to pay.</p>
<p>After entering all my credit card details (using a HSBC payment system) I get told that my card has been rejected and to contact the company, so the next day this is what I do. My phone call is answered by a very nice person who tries to be as helpful as possible, but tells me they don't have access to why my card was rejected, but that maybe it was the way I put my address in. I said ok, could I just pay over the phone.. and was told they don't accept payment except on the website!</p>
<p>I'm sorry... but if I was running a company I'd take payment in any way I could... I asked why and was told it was to help prevent credit card fraud! - as the person on the phone was so nice I gave their website another try, but my card was rejected again</p>
<p>I then went to a different company who would take my money, my order arrived 2 days later.</p>
<p>Moral for businesses... let people give you money!</p>
