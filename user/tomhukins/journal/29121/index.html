It's almost two weeks since our first MiltonKeynes.pm technical meeting and I've finally got round to putting the slides on <a href="http://miltonkeynes.pm.org" title="Milton Keynes Perl Mongers">our Web page</a>.
</p>

<p>
We got a respectable attendance:  ten people showed up including the four speakers.  The speakers covered a good variety of topics from Nik's talk about <a href="http://miltonkeynes.pm.org/talks/2006/03/nik_clayton_testing_legacy_code.pdf">Testing Legacy Code</a>, using clever tricks like overriding CORE::GLOBAL from within modules to affect how scripts run, through Dave's <a href="http://miltonkeynes.pm.org/talks/2006/03/dave_cross_databases_and_perl/">Databases and Perl</a>, covering DBI and Class::DBI with good explanations of problems you might encounter, and my <a href="http://miltonkeynes.pm.org/talks/2006/03/tom_hukins_www_mechanize.pdf">Gathering information from the Web with WWW::Mechanize</a> to Rod's talk (no slides) about using Perl to tie together a variety of large systems.
</p>

<p>
The range of talks did justice to Perl's versatility and power:  you can override its internals, hook into databases and Web sites easily, or use it as the Internet's duct tape with a few convenient scripts.
</p>

<p>
It's funny how time flies: tomorrow we're off to the pub again.
</p>

<p>
For a small city, not known for its computing industry, we're doing well enough to provoke London.pm into holding a long overdue <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=06/03/09/1317233">technical meeting</a>.  In a moment of weakness, Dean persuaded me to talk at that, too.
</p>

<p>
So I gave a lightning talk on <a href="http://london.pm.org/tech_talks/2006-03-23/tom_hukins-tracing_code_with_aspect_pm.pdf">Tracing  Code with Aspect.pm</a> which <a href="http://happygiraffe.net/blog/archives/2006/03/24/london-pm-tech-meet">Dominic Mitchell has summarised well</a>.  From the other talks, I learned a bit about OCaml and JSON both of which have lingered on my <em>things to learn about</em> list for too long.
</p>

<p>
This evening, I found myself fixing a Postfix installation on a Fedora box using yum.  I've used none of these before, but still managed to get everything working.  I didn't do this out of the goodness of my heart, though: I did it to guilt trip Robbie into talking about how he uses Perl to run a multiplayer game in his spare time at the next MiltonKeynes.pm technical meeting.  Watch this space.

<h2>Test::Inline</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2006-03-28T04:04:47</h3>
You might want to also mention Test::Inline to him.<br><br>I've found it very useful where a large, or HUGE, set of ugly existing modules have at least some things here and there that can be tested.<br><br>You drop in little chunks of testing code next to the code you are testing, and then inline2test compiles them out into proper scripts.
