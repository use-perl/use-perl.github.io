<p>I've been looking forward to today's London Perl Workshop for ages.  I've put together a talk, "Testing When You Don't Have Time", that I thought would fit well with the workshop's theme.<br/><br/>I felt really tired last night, so I went to bed early despite friends texting me, inviting me to the pub.<br/><br/>Today I woke up feeling rough.  I've only just got up, as of 11am, and I can't face the journey down to London.<br/><br/>Until now I had spoken at every (well, both) London Perl Workshops, so it's a shame to miss this one at the last minute.  I hope everything goes well for the organisers, speakers and attendees, and I hope to see everyone I'd looked forward to talking to soon.</p>

..but I'm stuck working on freelance stuff and every spare minute (quite literally - I only get to sit down when I'm programming) is taken up with fixing the house up ready for christmas and the baby.<br><br>I have to get the nursery ready before chrimbo as everything that goes in the nursery is currently at my mother-in-laws in their spare bedroom and that bedroom isn't spare much longer as my sister-in-law will be down for christmas.<br>

Not to worry -- Abigail filled in for you at last minute, giving his "Benchmark" talk.  Scary stuff.  I wish I'd known I was sitting next to <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/demerphq/" title="perl.org">demerphq</a perl.org> before opening my mouth...

<p>Anyway, I hope you start to feel better soon!
