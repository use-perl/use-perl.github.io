<div class="span8">
<p>Just over a couple of weeks ago, I gave a talk about <a href="http://belfast.yapc.org/wiki/index.cgi?RunningWebBusinessWithPerl" title="Running a Web Business with Perl (YAPC::Europe 2004 Wiki)">Running a Web business with Perl</a> to London.pm <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/2shortplanks/journal/20816" title="Journal of 2shortplanks describing September 2004's London.pm technical meeting">as 2shortplanks has already mentioned</a> in preparation for YAPC::Europe.<br/><br/>The talk went alright, and as a consequence I feel I delivered it much better in Belfast the week after.<br/><br/>I started out by introducing my talk and explaining that I was practicing for YAPC.  I asked the attendees to let me know what they thought afterwards, as any feedback would help me do a better job the week after.  I deliberately mentioned that I wanted both positive and negative feedback, as any opinions would help me improve.<br/><br/>Wow!  I got some wonderful feedback from several people, who provided lots of encouragement and insight, pointed out my weaknesses and suggested improvements I could make.<br/><br/>I managed to incorporate some, but not enough, of these improvements before Belfast.  Still, I have plenty of useful ideas to bear in mind for the future.<br/><br/>So, I wonder what to do:  Should I always ask for feedback or will this make me seem unprepared?  Perhaps it depends on the occasion.  Regardless, I have plenty of things to think about for the next few talks I give.<br/><br/>How should I respond to others' talks?  I don't want to seem rude by offering unwanted criticism, but I don't want to hold back opinions that might prove useful.  Maybe it's all about diplomacy and tact, skills that all programmers have in abundance.  Oh, wait a minute..<br/><br/>Finally, I don't want to suggest that I didn't get any feedback in Belfast.  I got some very satisfying responses but, as I hadn't asked for it, less insightful criticism and suggestions for improvement.  Anyone?</p>

<h2>Always asking for feedback</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2004-09-27T21:46:20</h3>
Every time I <i>teach</i> a class, I ask for feedback.  I never stop learning about being a better presenter.  There's always the next thing to know.
<p>
Of course, it has to be phrased like that. It can't be phrased as "I think I'm substandard, any feedback is welcome", or they'd start thinking that. {grin}</p>



<h2>Slides available?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/clscott/">clscott</a> on 2004-09-28T02:59:09</h3>
I'm interested in your talk. Do you have slides or a
paper available?

That brings me to another point:  I try to use slides as supporting material for my talk as opposed to something I read out to the audience.<br> <br>My slides won't make much sense to anyone who didn't hear the talk they accompany, so I tend not to distribute them.  On the other hand, this means people who didn't attend the talk can't find out about it.<br> <br>The ideal way for me to deal with this would be to write up my talks, which I must force myself to do before I forget what I talked about.<br> <br>I'll update the Wiki with any further information about this.

Good for you!  I'm already liking it.
<p>
Your slides should have two things in them: the outline of your talk, and props you need that you wouldn't be able to describe adequately in prose. It should <b>not</b> be the text of your talk.
</p><p>
In fact, if I catch any of my instructors (or myself {grin}) reading a bullet word-for-word, it's time for a little rethinking.</p>
