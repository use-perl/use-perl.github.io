I'd promised a <a href="http://miltonkeynes.pm.org/">Milton Keynes Perl
Mongers</a> technical meeting for some time, and on Thursday we finally
got round to holding one.
</p>

<p>
We've found that the Perl Mongers group has plenty in common with the
local <a href="http://www.mk.lug.org.uk">Linux User Group</a> so we
decided to hold a joint technical meeting.  We've had joint social
meetings for several months.
</p>

<p>
The meeting started with Dave Cross, our guest speaker, giving an
Introduction to the Template Toolkit.  Dave did a great job of showing
what TT does well.  I'm already a fan, so I hope Dave prompted other
listeners to discover its wonderfulness.
</p>

<p>
Adam Lowe told us about some of the projects he's working on at <a 
href="http://www.tnmoc.co.uk/">The
National Museum of Computing</a> at Bletchley Park.  They have some scarily
huge machines - some of which work! - that can't even store an MP3 file
on their tape drives.  As Dave pointed out, this seems strange given
that we used to store music on tapes not that long ago.  Adam's talk
made me want to revisit Bletchley Park and see what the Computing Museum
people are up to.
</p>

<p>
Oliver Gorwits told us about Oxford University's network and how it
works.  There's lots of Perl, Linux and other open source in there, as
you'd expect.  I particularly like that <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/SNMP-Effective/">SNMP::Effective</a>
plays a role in there, as Jan and Oliver have bounced around ideas for
its development on the #miltonkeynes.pm IRC channel.
</p> 

<p>
I've put all the slides online at <a
href="http://miltonkeynes.pm.org/">http://miltonkeynes.pm.org/</a>.
</p>

<p>
Conveniently, we found a real ale festival after the talks.  We enjoyed
a few beers and met up with Tony, who hadn't been able to make the
talks.
</p>

<p>
So, for a group that's just over two years old, I'm pleased with what
we've done.  I'm looking forward to some great meetings in 2008 with the
regulars, our old friends (I'm expecting visits from Birmingham.pm and
Matt Trout), and hopefully a few new visitors too.
</p>

<p>
It's also great to watch the open source community grow in the city
where I live.  It seems we have lots of people doing interesting things
here, but mostly we're not talking to each other.  We're slowly improving this.
