<div class="span8">
<p><p>Ovid recently asked what should be a simple question: <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=572344">How should we install tests along with modules?</a></p>
<p>Of course, this is not a simple question at all and breaks down into several distinct problems. The first is actually <b>"How do we test an installed module?"</b></p>
<p>kwilliams responded with the brilliant idea of a Module::Build retest action, that would look for modules in @INC instead of blib.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this doesn't completely solve our first problem.</p>
<p>Why? Because way too many tests are written with the assumption that they will be running from within an unpacked module distribution. Which means they require <b>context</b> outside of the installed .pm files.</p>

<p>Off the top of my head, the kinds of tests that have this problem include
<ul>
<li>Tests that pull in specific files from the distribution
	<ul><li>Tests that pull in test modules not in blib</li>
		<li>Tests for scripts installed with the module</li>
		<li>Tests that pull in data files (which may end up being installed)</li>
	</ul><li>
<li>Tests that depend on the whole distro structure
	<ul><li>Test::Signature</li>
		<li>Test::Distribution</li>
		<li>Test::Pod</li>
		<li>Test::Pod::Coverage</li>
		<li>tests that rely on the MANIFEST</li>
		<li>tests that scan files for spelling errors, minimum versions, or prereqs</li></ul></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>You could argue that any of these that are abstracted into Test::Whatever modules have enough of a layer of indirection to account for however you test installed modules. But I think that misses the point. A list that large is not evidence of special cases. It's evidence that it's important for tests to have more than the .pm alone.</p>
<p>One solution that sucks could be a way of marking which tests assume they're being run in a distribution and which ones don't care. That would be horribly tedious.</p>
<p>Maybe this is evidence that we need a metadata database to go with our installed modules. We already have a PACKLIST that sorta kinda serves as an installed module database. The problem is, now we need an API for tests to query that database.</p>
<p>Maybe we're going about this wrong. Tests need a distribution. Modules work in a distribution and out of a distribution. It's common to develop modules inside a distribution.</p>
<p><b>Why not install an entire module distribution?</b></p>
<p>Have a lib-like directory which is searched for entire distributions rather than just .pm files. When you use a module, it will actually be pulled from its distribution.</p>
<p>Running modules from within distributions? Doesn't that sound like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?PAR">PAR?</a></p></p>

<blockquote> <div><p>Because way too many tests are written with the assumption that they will be running from within an unpacked module distribution.</p></div> </blockquote>

<p>Which is exactly the situation that the <tt>retest</tt> feature in Module::Build assumes, so I don&#x2019;t quite see why this is a problem.</p>

<p>The problem is that installed modules have more to them than the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.pm files, and those are basically the only parts of your installation you're going to be testing when you use <code>retest</code>.</p>
<p>Tests for scripts will be tests on the scripts in the distribution, not the ones installed. Likewise for all the other things that a distro can have.</p>

<h2>Simple</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/acme/">acme</a> on 2006-09-18T12:42:05</h3>
It was my original request. I want to make sure that things still work even though I've upgraded a module low down in the dependency tree. I don't want to solve this in every case. I don't want the moon on a stick. I just want something simple, like copying t/* somewhere during install. I was afraid of posting about it because I knew people would go overboard and get philosophical. And look what happened when Ovid mentioned it...

I'm interested in the future of the module ecosystem.<br><br>This was an opportunity for me to get philisophical, but it wasn't your fault.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
