<p>In concurrency, one of those levels having its assumptions challenged is the programmer, but that's not the only reason it's hard.</p>

A nice collection to add to my bookmarks, and serious food for thought. My only nit is the title of the last article: "threads" has come to mean many things, I think a better title might be "The Problem With <i>Threads As Fibers</i>", <b>not</b> the possibly implied
"The Problem With <i>Threaded Concurrency</i>".<p>

I hope people take time to read the articles before just assuming they're another reason to dismiss/avoid Perl's threads. ithreads has its issues, but applying some of the techniques in Lee's article may  mitigate the nondeterminism issues somewhat (as I've attempted w/ Thread::Apartment).</p>

This issue with assumptions if why I removed as many as I could and came up with Process.pm<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>I'm having fairly good success with it for things other than actual parallel processing (running different parts of a program across two different versions of Perl).<br><br>I'm hoping it's going to be a slam dunk when the time comes to do some serious work with it.
