<h2>Just to give you a hard time</h2>

It seems like you're just posting our conversations now, but I'll bite.<br> <br><br/><br/>My counterexample is religion. I can't think of anything else that, given an infinite amount of time, you couldn't understand completely. But, assuming you believe in the Jewish/Protestant God (I'm not sure about others), part of your belief is that you were created unable to understand divine things. The only parts of this argument that are debatable are the truth of religion and whether religion is a "tool". The former must be taken individually and the latter is a tricky argument to make without offense. Though, I guess you could argue that it's a tool that gives you a framework for how to live your life.<br> <br><br/><br/>Anyway, the whole point of me registering for an account and posting this is to point out that you're sleeping through class right now, and I should be. Oh, the lengths I'll go to be a jackass.

Just to be clear, the tool suckage principle is something I came up with months before our conversation.<br><br>Also, your jackassery is indeed awesome.

It is not necessary to understand something completely in order to be able to figure out why it sucks.<br><br>For example, I don't understand religion completely, but I understand that it sucks because beliefs become dogma too easily.<br><br>Your argument about why religion is a tool has convinced me.

<p><div class="quote">assuming you believe in the Jewish/Protestant God (I'm not sure about others), part of your belief is that you were created unable to understand divine things</div> Not quite.  First, some divine things are understandable.  Second, the only things not understandable are those things which are impossible for any noninfinite, created, being to understand.  It's not that we were created unable to understand those things, but that we cannot understand those things because we created.<br><br>Not that this has anything to do with anything.

<h2>Perfect software systems</h2>

It seems like Steve Yegge has been blogging about perfect software systems here: <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/01/pinocchio-problem.html" title="blogspot.com">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/01/pinocchio-problem.html</a blogspot.com>.
Sometimes he writes interesting things. Well, ok, sometimes he misses the point completely. He's not that perfect as well.
