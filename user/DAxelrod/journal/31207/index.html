<p><p>My reaction to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2006/10/2/5475">this</a>:</p>

<p><i>A while ago...</i></h2>
<br><b>NJ Legislator 1:</b> So, if we count that pile of dollar bills <em>three times</em>, it means we have more money!
<br><b>NJ Legislator 2:</b> But we don't have more money, we've just counted wrong.
<br><b>NJL1:</b> Not "wrong". <em>Differently!</em>
<br><b>NJL2:</b> Uh, you think the public will fall for that?
<br><b>NJL1:</b> Sure! Even though they dump a huge percent of their high property taxes into schools, they don't know enough math to catch it, and they don't have enough civic responsibility to care!</p>

<p><i>Later...</i>
<br><b>McGreevy:</b> I'm a Gay American.
<br><b>NJ:</b> Dude, it's 2004. No one cares if you're having orgies with midgets and Koala bears.
<br><b>McGreevy:</b> And while your heart is bleeding for me, the powerless repressed minority who, uh, holds most powerful office in the state...
<br><b>NJ:</b> <em>Sigh</em>. What?
<br><b>McGreevy:</b> I've been funnelling large amounts of your tax dollars to my lover! But buy my book about it!
<br><b>NJ:</b> Dammit! Get out of office!
<br><b>McGreevy:</b> I can see you're not yet tolerant enough to accept me. Fine. I'll step down. In a few months. Buy my book.
<br><b>Interim Governor:</b> You didn't elect me, but I actually don't suck! Democracy works!</p>

<p><i>Later...</i>
<br><b>NJ Supreme Court:</b> Hey, Legislature?
<br><b>NJ Legislature:</b> What is it? Want more caviar or bling?
<br><b>NJSC:</b> No. Listen, you gotta stop this crazy accounting crap.
<br><b>NJ Legislature:</b> Uh, sure thing. It'll take effect <em>after</em> we're all out of office and our predecesors will have to deal with the  fallout.</b>
<br><b>NJSC:</b> Sorry. Come up with a non-fantasy budget before you adjourn for the summer.
<br><b>NJL:</b> Aww, but I was just about to ship off to Aruba on taxpayer dollars!
<br><b>New Governor:</b> No. I'm locking you in the freakin' building until you come up with a budget.</p>

<p><i>Now...</i>
<br><b>NJ Legislature:</b> Ok, everybody. We're raising taxes-
<br><b>Public:</b> -We don't have to pump our own gas now, do we?
<br><b>NJL:</b> No. Nobody even mentioned that.
<br><b>Public:</b> Well, it always comes up whenever anybody talks about New Jersey.
<br><b>NJL:</b> Listen, we're also making you pay for media downloads and shipping and handling. That'll mostly affect younger citizens.
<br><b>18 Year Old NJ Citizen:</b> Dammit! If I cared enough to vote, I would <em>so</em> get rid of this government!
<br><b>McGreevy:</b> Buy my book!
<br><b>Citizen:</b> No. I'd have to pay taxes on shipping and handling.</p>
<br>
<p><b>DISCLAIMER</b><br>Facts have been bent for humor's sake. Feel free to correct me in the comments.</p></p>

<h2>I heart NJ factual distortions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/DAxelrod/">DAxelrod</a> on 2006-10-03T16:55:23</h3>
Off the top of my head, facts I bent were that the interim governor *was* elected, just not to that position per se. Also, I have no evidence that the new taxes will disproportionally affect younger people.<br><br>If you have other factual corrections, please leave them as replies to this comment.
