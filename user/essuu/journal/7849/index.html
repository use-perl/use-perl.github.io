<p>Day 2 of the conference proper was excellent. I saw Casey West talk about using Template Toolkit. I already use TT2 a lot but it was still god to watch someone talk about it with such enthusiasm.<br><br><br/><br/>James Duncan talked about Pixie, a very cool looking object database. I can already see uses for it in some of my own work.<br><br><br/><br/>Gellyfish's talk was a truely awe-inspiring demonstration of the art of off-the-cuff, hungover presenting :)<br><br><br/><br/>I dropped in on Geoffrey Avery's talk about ExtUtils::ModuleMaker which seems like a very powerful replacement for h2xs and then settled into the main hall for power and bandwidth. I wasn't too interested in Thomas Klausner's obfuscation talk, I was waiting for the Testing talk following it, but I found myself considerably impressed by what he was able to do. I've always considered obfuscation to be a bunch of clever tricks of no real use but I think that I may spend more time looking at it. Theone thing that the lecture revealed to me was that obfuscation teaches you a lot about the guts of perl and that can only be good in the long run.<br><br><br/><br/>Paul Johnson's Testing and Code Coverage talk was interesting but very dry. Most of it was taken up with discussing the definitions and theory of code coverage. I would have preferred to see longer spent on actually using the tools available to perl programmers, such as Pauls own <code>Devel::Cover</code>.<br><br><br/><br/>After tea, we had a series of excellent lightning talks and the Jos Boumans took us through POE for beginners. Jos is a very entertaining speaker and the war stories he used to fill the time at the end of the talk were very funny.<br><br><br/><br/>The evening went the usual route, with much beer consumed and ending in Greps room for a game of guess the tune (thanks to many gigabytes of mp3s and iTunes) and much singing fuelled by a bottle of Bushmills from the bar.<br><br><br/><br/>Day three is starting slowly :-/</p>
