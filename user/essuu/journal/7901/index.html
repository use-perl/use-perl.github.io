<p>Saturday didn't happen. Honest. ;-)<br><br><br/><br/>I did go to Oktoberfest though, the party split with some jumping in a cab and Barbie & friend, Andy Wilson and I going one stop on the U-Bahn. No problem, thought I, we'll meet them there.<br><br><br/><br/>No one had explained how utterly, utterly huge Oktoberfest is. I have never seen so many people so drunk in one place ever. And this from a memeber of london.pm ! Needless to say, we didn't find the others but I did have a go on the <a href="http://www.somecoasters.com/main/coasters/eurostar/eurostar.html">rollercoaster</a>.  It was awesome, even after drinking for most of the day. Sometimes, though, I really wish I didn't wear glasses (I don't get on with contacts) as it sort of spoils the fun when everything is even more blurred than usual. Next year I might actually have to make a special trip to sample Oktoberfest properly.<br><br><br/><br/>Sunday dawned bright and early for me as I made my way to the airport at 7am. Somehow I had managed to book an earlier flight than all the other london.pm'ers but in a way that was good as I really was too tired and jaded to talk this morning.<br><br><br/><br/>Now I'm back at home and pondering what I learned from YAPC.<br><br/><br/><ul>
  <li>Larry rocks, we really appreciate you coming all the way over.</li>
  <li><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Schwern/journal">Schwern</a> is a brave man.</li>
  <li><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/cwest/journal">Casey West</a> would have provided one of the most memorable moments of the conference, except <b>it didn't happen.</b> :)</li>
  <li>iBook is the portable computing platform of choice for descerning geeks.</li>
  <li>Perl is very much alive and well</li>
  <li><code>ExtUtils::ModuleMaker</code> and <code>Test::More</code> look very useful and will feature in future projects.</li>
  <li>Drinking with Grep, Gellyfish and Evil Dave leads to badness. Strictly speaking I learned this last year too but I foolishly seem to have forgotten it :)</li>
  <li>I really should make more effort to learn the local language. We had 8 months warning after all.</li>
</ul><br><br/><br/>So where are we going next year ? Can't wait !<br><br><br/><br/>And Sony ? Well having failed to deliver it <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/essuu/journal/7812">before the conference</a>, they also failed to deliver it <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/essuu/journal/7823">at the conference</a>. I decided that I didn't want to waste any more money on international calls to listen to their awful hold music so I figured I'd just hassle them when I got back. Guess what I found on my doormat when I got home ? Yup - A card from DHL saying they had attempted to deliver the battery on Friday. So Sony hadn't redirected the shipment at all. I suppose I shouldn't really be surprised :-(</p>
