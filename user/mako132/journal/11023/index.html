<div class="span8">
<p>A step in our Distance Education production process is the converting of PowerPoint slides to HTML.  We've been doing this manually.<br/><br/>We're looking to save time by automating this --  having instructors email or upload the presentation, automatically convert it and transfer it to the right server.<br/><br/>Over a year ago, I discovered and purchased PPT2HTML (http://www.rdpslides.com/pptools/), a VB program which implements a 'watched' dropbox and configuration templates and does the automatic conversion.   Naturally, I'd rather do this with Perl, so I have complete control.<br/><br/>I attempted it a year ago, but stuck when it turns out that Office97's PowerPoint doesn't have an OLE interface to saving as HTML.<br/><br/>But this week, perhaps due to luck, I discovered that later Offices (at least OfficeXP) has the interface now and I stumbled upon a Javascript/ActiveX snippet that did a simple conversion.  I ran with that and Win32::OLE and now I'm rocking and rolling.<br/><br/>Before I was rockin' and rollin',  I lurchin' and reelin' trying to use Win32::API to import ppt2html.dll (Office97's Internet Assistant).  I made baby steps, but never got any output.<br/><br/>Why bother with Office97?  Because the converted HTML is so much cleaner way back then.  Now Microsoft's HTML conversion produces monster files bloated with every [XD]HTML feature and Microsoft extension in an attempt to duplicate the exact look of a PowerPoint Presentation in Internet Explorer.<br/><br/>So I intend to snag the images and text from the OfficeXP conversion and roll them into HTML::Template's built from a representative Office97 conversion.  I know people have also written filters to clean up  the Microsoftisms from an HTML conversion, so I'll try those too.</p>

<h2>What about pdf??</h2>

Have you considered using acrobat to print to a pdf file, then process the pdf file to produce the html.<br/><br/>This might be a better long term solution as the pdf output is likely to change a lot less than the html output will.<br/><br/>Just a thought...<br/><br/>--John C
