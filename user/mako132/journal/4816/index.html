<p>XML::Twig seems to be doing the job.  I was surprised to the see the plist XML file as an example in <i>Perl &amp; XML</i>.  That was enough to make me (or rather my corporate Amex) buy it.
<P>
But what's really on my mind? <b>Skunks.</b>  Do skunks climb? My one-way exit under the porch for the skunks has a way in if the skunks can climb the wire screen over the top.  Aren't they like squirrels?  Or am I remembering a Pepe Le Pew episode?  The one where the female squirrel paints herself black to avoid another squirrel?
<P>
Fox urine.  People tell me I need <b>fox</b> urine. Not coyote urine.</p>

I was just explaining to my downstairs neighbor that -- if she <em>really</em> wants to keep her hyper-self-conscious children under control -- I could get her a bottle of skunk musk, and she could spray a dilute form on them should they misbehave.  Just suggesting it in front of them has helped already.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>If you can't find fox urine</h2>

If you can't find fox urine, try mothballs. A friend who had a skunk under their porch tossed a couple of mothballs in, and the skunk was gone that evening.<br>

My research hasn't shown convincing evidence that mothballs work and damn if the mothballs don't stink too (a weaker smell and more familiar smell, albeit).  I tried it.  In fact I took a whole box of mothballs, put them in a mesh bag, and tossed it under the porch.  I was in a tactical mood<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-O
<p>
I found fox urine at Home Depot.  Expensive, but you figure they've got to pay someone alot to hold the fox over the bucket...</p>

<h2>Ferret dung</h2>

If you make a solution out of ferret dung and want and put it around the perimeter, you will get rid of your skunks that way as well.<br> <br>If you should happen to need some, I've got plenty that I could ship you.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

But then I'll have every ferret in the area trying to party under my porch!
<p>
I wonder if my daughter's soiled diapers could be put to use...
</p><p>
I could fold them up into bundles and stack them around like sand bags.</p>
