<p>So it seems that the first generation Apple Airports like mine overheat and cook their power conditioning circuitry.<br/><br/>So early last week I started noticing that my connection kept dropping.  By Friday it was up for 5 seconds, restarting for 15, up for another 5 and so on.  And now I've got red LEDs instead of amber and green.<br/><br/>Now I'm forced to use my only directly networked computer, a Mac 9600 running 8.6.<br/><br/>I am used to carrying my laptop around the house, noodling in front of the tv, the kitchen or the dining room.  Alas, the desk I have the 9600 on is barely big enough to hold the monitor and a SCSI drive, so I can't easily use its network cable for the laptop.<br/><br/>Linksys is in my future.</p>

I phoned up apple support, told them the serial number and got a free replacement.  I was very pleased with their prompt response.

Really?  What I read on the net lead me to believe that it was too late to do that.<br> <br>But I'll give it a try.<br> <br>Meanwhile, the Linksys WAP is humming along.

I did mine about 4 or 5 months ago.  I wouldn't think that they'd rescind an offer like that; there can't be that many of the units affected left out there.
