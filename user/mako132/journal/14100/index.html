<p>Agghhh.  I'm so %$!@#$@ old.<br/><br/>In April, I got glasses because after programming all day, especially when under pressure, my right eye would start to ache.  Turns out I've got some astigmatism there, but otherwise I see fine.  So I put them on when I'm in hardcore coding mode (once or twice a week).<br/><br/>But lately it seems to be getting worse.  I think I'm going to have to wear them all the time.<br/><br/>Add that to my chronic shoulder basketball injury, my plantar injury  (basketball, Mexican folkdancing), weak lower back (basketball and wicked spin serve in tennis), it's a wonder I can still sit on the toilet and take a dump :(<br/><br/>But hey, I made it to 38 before the implosion.</p>

A guy I used to work with had a brother who was also a programmer. This programming brother worked at Bell Labs, and said that there was another guy there who kept programming even after he had lost his eyesight almost completely. The guy was such an assett that they hired another person just to serve as his eyes (typing for him, and relating what was on the screen). A whole different flavor of pair programming eh? This kind of reminds me of stories of how James Joyce was rumored to have written large parts of Finnegans Wake writing a single word per page, because his eyesight was so bad. Hopefully your eyesight will improve with better glasses 8-)
