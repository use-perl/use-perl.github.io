<p>Today, a litle light exercise, some fettucine at lunch.  Now watching <i>The Waterboy</i> while my wife hits the grocery store to get some non-perishables for OSCON.  The only way the OSCON meal badges are worth it is if my family eats every single meal at convention.  Think about that - is that likely?  I say - <b>Let's just pay for what we need.</b>  $10 bucks a person for breakfast, maybe $15 for lunch, and $25 for adults for dinner ($15 for kids).
<p>
Instead I'll probably eat less meals with my fellow OSCON-ers, rather than have my family eat alone.  I doubt that was O'Reilly's intention. :-(

<h2>Eating on the Cheap at TPC</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Elian/">Elian</a> on 2002-07-21T23:23:21</h3>
There's a nice little deli/snack shack at the marina, between the two towers of the conference hotel. I ate there more than once last year, even with the food service provided. It's cheap, reasonably good and, if you time it right, fast. (While the line moves fast, there's a limit to how soon you can eat when there are 40 people ahead of you...)<br> <br>Less than $10/meal, with drinks and chips. Assuming, of course, that you don't mind grinders/heroes/hoagies/sandwitches.

Right.  I ate there last year.  I forgot about that.<br> <br>What's this "Whole Foods" thing on the shuttle schedule?  Grocery store?<br> <br>Good to see the breakfast buffet is only $8 for kids at the East Tower restaurant.
