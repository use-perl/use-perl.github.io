<p>Jeeze, I spend as much time futzing with Perl module installs as I do coding.  What I need is something that shows me what modules (and version) my script is using so that I figure out why the @##$^#$^ thing works like a charm on one OS but barfs 'Use of uninitialized value ...' in another.

<tt>&gt; What I need is something that shows me what<br>&gt; modules (and version) my script is using<br> <br>how about which lib directory those modules are being<br>loaded from? The following END block will do all of<br>that for you. Note that you may need to have it print<br>to a log file or something instead of the currently-<br>selected filehandle. ((Code at end of this post.))<br> <br>You can create a trivial test script that has just a<br>shebang line, then use's several modules, then has<br>this END block. It should spew your info to STDOUT.<br> <br>Once you've got it producing output for each instance<br>of your script, just diff the two to find what's up.<br> <br>If there *are* no differences, then at least you've<br>ruled out module versions as an issue. You still have<br>platform issues, perl versions, webserver and webserver<br>congig issues (if this is a CGI script), %ENV issues,<br>permissions issues, etc.<br> <br>Good luck &nbsp;:)<br> <br>-matt<br> <br>END { no strict 'refs';<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; for my $k ( sort keys %INC ) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ( my $module = $k ) =~ s{[:/\\]}{::}g;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $module =~ s{\.pm$}{};<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $version = ${"${module}::VERSION"};<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if ( defined $version ) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $version = "\$${module}::VERSION = $version\n";<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } else { # maybe they didn't use ALLCAPS<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my @found = (<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; map { defined ${"${module}::$_"}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;? qq(\$${module}::$_ = ${"${module}::$_"}) : ()<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; grep { m/^version$/i }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; keys %{"${module}::"}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; );<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $version = !@found<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ?

Yow!  Thanks!  I'll try it.  My first guess was some BEGIN block vodoo (but I hadn't yet given it real thought).<br/><br/>I'm going to rig up some Test:: stuff also.  I tend to develop in FreeBSD and Linux and then go production on Solaris so I'll write me up a good test script...

<tt>&gt; My first guess was some BEGIN block<br> <br>You could put that in a BEGIN block instead of an END block<br>if you wanted. It would still work... however, it would miss<br>two classes of modules:<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1) any modules use()'ed after the BEGIN block<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2) any modules require()'ed rather than use()'ed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;whether before or after the BEGIN block or in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;some other module<br> <br>By sticking it in an END block, you catch both of the above<br>classes of modules. Nothing's perfect though... either way<br>will miss modules require()'ed in later END blocks or funky<br>cases where your code might have monkeyed with the symbol<br>table (probably not likely to happen by accident &nbsp;:)<br> <br>-matt<br> </tt>
