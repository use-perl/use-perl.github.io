<p>I wrote up a little script using Mail::Send.  Mail::Send doesn't explicity have a from() method, but $msg->set('From', 'quxx@example.com') works fine.  Or at least it worked fine on my laptop.  However when I moved the same script to my server, I mail was now being sent out from 'apache@protest.net'.
<p>
I was puzzled.  I tried making apache a trusted Exim user, double checked that example.com was acknowledged as a local domain, etc, etc.  In mounting frustration I was tempted to throw it all out, and revert to the bad old days of talking to sendmail (well Exim in sendmail clothing) directly.
<p>
Then it hit me, Mail::Send is using Mail::Mailer under the covers, Mail::Mailer first attempts to send mail out using the unix mail program, and then falls back on using sendmail.
<p>
My laptop doesn't have mail installed, the server does.
<p>
So if I change:
<code>$fh = $msg->open(); # $msg is an instance of mail send</code>
<br>to<br>
<code>$fh = $msg->open('sendmail');</code>
<p>
Now everything works like a charm.
<p>
I mention this here, because surprisingly a quick google search turned up no mentions of anyone ever running into a similiar problem.  So hopefully the next person (assuming anyone else is as slow) will stumble across this.</p>

I had to do the same thing to make the cpantest work on some of my boxes the symptom was that the header was screwed<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:<br>
The subject was thrown out of the Header and appeared in the body prefixed by '~s'.<br>
(Thus making it an invalid bounced message (no subject))<br>



<h2>I had the same problem</h2>

I ended up giving up and using Mail::Sendmail or MIME::Lite but its good to know a fix.

I was going mad over this - thanks for the fix. I guess I should've realised it was using mail sooner.
