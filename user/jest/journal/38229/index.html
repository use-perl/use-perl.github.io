<p>"R is similar to other programming languages, like C, Java and Perl, in that it helps people perform a wide variety of computing tasks by giving them access to various commands."<br/><br/>http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-computing/07program.html<br/><br/>Oh.

What would you have written?



<h2>a better sentence</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jest/">jest</a> on 2009-01-07T13:11:55</h3>
<p>"Like most modern programming languages, R is capable of performing a variety of tasks, but it specializes in powerful statistical analysis."</p><p>The target reader for this article has never heard of C or Perl, and probably not Java; doesn't know the phrase "Turing-complete"; doesn't think that Haskell is cool; doesn't know why one would choose one language over another.</p><p>What is this reader supposed to make of "by giving them access to various commands"? I guarantee that if I read that to my father, who is a smart man who has read the NYT for his whole life, he would not know what this means.</p><p>What does "helps people perform a wide variety of computing tasks" mean? "Helps"?</p><p>It's unbearably bad. And I'm not saying from a geek standpoint--it's not that it glosses over some fine distinction that only we care about. It's bad from the standpoint of anyone trying to get information out of it.</p>

It's also bad in listing a number of names of programming languages, as the author apparently assumes the user doesn't even know what programming is. It is totally superfluous information.

<p>The proposed sentence added the most important thing about R. In light of that the original sentence is overly verbose.</p><p>Not knowing anything about programming, OTOH, original sentence is just as good.</p>

I think my non-editorial brain heard a faint alarm bell when I read that sentence.  I was just excited about the faintest whiff of legitimacy<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
