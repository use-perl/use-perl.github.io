<p><p>I run a small library database for my company, most of which is based in England. Every month, a cron job sends a listing of newly added books, based on the record-creation date, to the library administrator, who then forwards it to everyone.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I got e-mail from the library admin, saying, "There was a problem with the book list&mdash;there were books on it that aren't new, but had just been edited in the past month. Several people complained, 'Wait, don't we already have that in the library?'"</p>

<p>So I run tests. I look over the code with a fine-tooth comb. As far as I can tell, there's absolutely no way this can be happening as described. I e-mail back, saying "Which books turn up as new that were already in? What sort of editing did the keyboarder to do these records?"</p>

<p>This morning I get an e-mail, "Well, the keyer didn't actually edit the entries&mdash;she just deleted them and then added them again with the changes made."</p>
