<p><p>So last night I sit down to do a big refactoring job on some code. It should be fairly straightforward; I'm not changing how anything is done, just some of the structure of the OO code to make it more like an MVC approach.</p>

<p>And for no reason I can think of, this one aspect of the display is not working. It's effectively identical to what was there before, and it works on the first run of this one program, but when the program is re-called, a radiogroup gets messed up. And I just can't figure out why it's happening. Worse, changing around things that should make absolutely no difference cause it to work.</p>

<p>I go to sleep late, having accomplished very little, and in the morning ask another coder to look at it. He can't figure it out either. Finally, for the hell of it, I change this one variable from <pre>-values</pre> to <pre>-content</pre>, and lo! it's working!</p>

<p>But I don't know why.</p>

<p>Oh, and happy birthday to me!</p></p>

Congratulations with your nth birthday.<br> <br>How did the radio thingies get 'messed up'? Wrong order? Ugly colours?

<p>Only one of the buttons appeared (there should have been two), and with no value. Perhaps this did have something to do with the fact that I was using <code>-value</code> myself<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-). But indeed, the appearance of the radiogroup in this way could not be predicted by some of the other changes.</p>
