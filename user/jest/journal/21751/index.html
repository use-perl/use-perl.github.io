<p><p>I have a project that's needed some improvements for a while. I had been putting it off, because I thought it would be very difficult to get everything done well, and I was also waiting for a colleague whose input would have some (extremely minor, but good to have as an excuse) impact on how I implemented the changes. Finally, the colleague's comments came in, and I got started.</p>

<p>In about three hours, I had <i>everything</i> done that I had wanted to do. And tested. And this wasn't just a single thing&mdash;I had to write several new helper methods, add additional database code, write a few new templates, tweak a stylesheet. My errors during the process were all simple things, like missing semicolons.</p>

<p>I'm looking at the working result and feeling happily flabbergasted that it all worked so smoothly.</p>

<p>And I'm trying to figure out how it happened. Is it that I spent months thinking about it instead of doing it, so that when the time came to code, I had already worked it out? Was it actually a simple process, and I had just convinced myself it was hard? Did I become a better programmer in the few months since I planned to start?</p>

<p>Whatever it is, it's a good feeling. Now, if only I could do something so that this is the way I work <i>all</i> the time....</p></p>
