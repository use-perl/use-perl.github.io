<p><p>One of the neat things about <a href="http://books.google.com">Google Books</a> is that I can keep track of my library digitally (I can do the same with <a href="http://www.librarything.com">Library Thing</a> as well).  One thing I would really love to have is a similar system for my journal articles.  The main reasons for this is the fact that I have a large number of journal articles photocopied and it is kind of difficult to keep track of them (other than the fact that I keep them in huge pile rather than trying to sort them).  If anyone knows of such a thing, please let me know.</p>

<p>What would be <i>really</i> neat would be to have a system that hooked into Bibtex so that it would automatically add a hyperref link to the article online rather than just to the bibliography at the end of your book/article.</p></p>

<p>And ideally it would also accommodate photos of journal article pages on your hard drive.  I take my camera with me to the library a lot these days, because photocopies are 7p per page and digital photos are not.  (Shockingly, the Bodleian supports this now.)</p><p>I've actually thought of writing some sort of article manager myself, but am not going to get around to it for a while.</p>

<p>Shockingly, they let me handle MS Rawl. B512 without gloves as well.</p><p>If you have good digital photographs of the pages of the article, you might be able to use an open source OCR program to make them fully text search able as well.</p>
