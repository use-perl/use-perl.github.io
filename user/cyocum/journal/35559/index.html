<p><p>I was reading about the merger proposal by <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/349683_msftyahoo02.html">Microsoft to Yahoo</a>.  I am rather firmly opposed to it.  When Gates likes to talk about "innovation", it rings rather hollow when Microsoft does not "innovate"; it buys someone in the space they want to enter.  Honestly, I would rather see them continue their own search engine than buy Yahoo.  Can they not compete by writing their own?  I am rather hoping that they get turned down by the various regulatory bodies or by Yahoo's own shareholders.</p></p>

"Buy[ing] someone in the space they want to enter" is exactly what Yahoo does.  Overture (search engine), eGroups, del.icio.us, flickr, Oddpost, Zimbra, etc.<br><br>I believe the Microsoft take-over is more about eyeballs than technology.  MS could spend all that money to develop some really great technology but getting people to really use it is a little trickier than that.

<p>Yeah, you are probably closer to the truth.  I am a bit uncomfortable with the fact that google has most of my person information now but I may have to move my flickr pics to them if MS takes over.</p>
