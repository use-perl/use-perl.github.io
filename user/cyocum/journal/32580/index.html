<div class="span8">
<p><p>As I am beginning to work with TGE, I am thinking about how best to represent this kind of transformation.  PIR is great for now but the language tag keeps leaping out to my eye and I keep wondering about the future of tree transformations.</p>

<p>There are a couple of examples for transforming trees already avaliable from the mark up language world.  In SGML, you can do this with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSSSL">DSSSL</a>, which is a scheme like language.  I have not worked with it.  In XML, you have two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSL-FO">XSL:FO</a> and XSLT.  From what I have gathered, XSL:FO is for formatting to any other format while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSL_Transformations">XSLT</a> is for formatting into another XML representation.  These two languages use XML as their base language rather than some other representation like DSSSL.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see what the wizards have up their sleeves for the transformation end of the compiler tool chains.  I would figure that it would go down the same path as PGE as a Perl6 like syntax.  Although, scheme and lisp have much going for them in terseness but I think that it would be easier for a programmer if they representation of the transformation is in a similar langauge as their grammar.  Thus, although, I sometimes wonder about using XML as a transformation language, it seems to work out quite well for its purpose.</p></p>

<h2>XSLT is the language; syntax is not important</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dakkar/">dakkar</a> on 2007-03-05T19:10:12</h3>
<p>First, a detail: XSL:FO is a page description language (think HTML+CSS, but more comprehensive, and with full support for page-based layouts and typography), it's not a transformation language. XSLT is the transformation language; it's supposed to be used to transform semantically-structured XML documents into presentation form (be it text, HTML, XSL:FO, or whatever).</p>

<p>Second, syntax is almost never a problem: XSLT is a nice transformation language in spite of the rather awful syntax. If TGE can get a tree-transformation language implementing the most useful <em>semantic</em> of XSLT and DSSSL, even if it's in the form of a set of PMCs, it would be immensely useful.</p>

<p>Thanks for the clarifications and explanations!  I think I starting to understand TGE and PAST but there is still a long way for me to go.</p>

<h2>Plumhead, parser and tree transformation compariso</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Bernhard/">Bernhard</a> on 2007-03-05T19:54:54</h3>
<p>
In my project Plumhead, <a href="http://rakudo.org/parrot/index.cgi?plumhead" title="rakudo.org">http://rakudo.org/parrot/index.cgi?plumhead</a rakudo.org> I'm working on a side by side comparison of various parser and tree transformation approaches. The use case is an implementation of PHP on Parrot.
</p>
<p>
Currently I have XSLT, TGE and Antlr3 tree transformations. So far Antlr3 is the most convienient for generating the syntax tree as I need it for Parrot.
