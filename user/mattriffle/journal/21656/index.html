<p>[Disclaimer:  I do realize I'm pushing an American organization to an international audience.  Research is universal, though.]<p>

Well, it was 2 months ago today that I last posted.
That post contributed to the <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jhi/journal/20707">irritation</a>
of a former pumpking slash maintainer of the CPAN.<p>

Where does one go from there?  Why, now I'm here to ask for money. ;)<p>

My wife and I have joined the American Stroke
Association's Train To End Stroke program.  In
a nutshell, we are raising $7600 for the ASA, and
training to run a half-marathon this coming January.<p>

You can read all about our efforts here:<p>

<a href="http://www.jennandmatt.com/ttes">http://www.jennandmatt.com/ttes</a><p>

Here are a few facts about stroke, copied from there:<p>
<ul>
<li>Every 45 seconds, someone in America has a stroke.
<li>700,000 people will suffer a stroke this year.
<li>170,000 people will be killed this year by a stroke.
<li>According to one study, nearly 1/3 of stroke victims are under age 65.
</ul><p>

Let me get the Perl hook in at this point -- I'm
offering to double-match any donations I receive through this posting.  For instance, if you donate $50 through
the secure link at the URL above, I will donate
an additional $50 to the ASA, plus another $50
to the Perl Foundation (up to $600 total donation on my part).<p>

I should also note that if you itemize on your
tax return, the donation is deductible.<p>

So, why are we doing this?  In part it's because
we wanted a structured program to get in better
shape, honestly.  But the research the ASA is doing is very important, most of all.<p>

My family lost my Aunt Janet to stroke when she was still in her thirties.  I was a small child at the time, and my only memories of her are fragments of a trip we took to her house in Michigan a year or two before she died.<p>

<ul>
<li>Her being exasperated as my first shot at the
mini-golf course skipped out of play and in to
the parking lot.
<li>Her being exasperated as my misinterpretation
of her shower instructions resulted in the bath
mat <i>in</i> the shower, and a flooded bathroom.
<li>Her being exasperated as I finished a
McDonald's hamburger (a feat for me in those days) only to promptly throw it back up after gagging
on a stray onion (still don't like those) that was
in the last bite.
</ul><p>

As you can see, I was pretty exasperating 
in those days.  I'd like to think I'm not now, and I wish she were here to see that.<p>

The point is, given the statistics, every day there are a bunch of little kids like I was, suffering similar losses.  I can't help my Aunt;  I can try to help others.  So that's why I'm here asking for money.<p>

Thanks for listening.<p>
