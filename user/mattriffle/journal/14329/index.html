<p>Warning: no Perl content to be found within.<p>

So, when we moved into our new (first) house a few
months ago, we started fostering* kittens for
<a href="http://www.animal-friends.org/">Animal
Friends</a>, where my wife works.<p>

This was sold to me as some sort of utopian access
to unlimited kitten cuteness, available whenever I
needed a pick-me-up.  And, at first, it was.  The
first four kittens we  had were wonderful, so much
so that we ended up adopting <a 
href="http://www.jennandmatt.com/albums/cats/abo">one of them</a> (yes, he only has one eye;  he
doesn't realize or care about that, though, and neither do we).<p>

The next three were very young, and my wife spent
weeks bottle-feeding them every 3 hours, around
the clock.  It seemed like they were going to
make it, but then we lost them one-by-one over
a week's time, due to a virus their little
immune systems couldn't fend off.  That was really
hard.  (I made a
<a href="http://www.spiritconnorandrachel.com/">web
site</a> for them.)<p>

At that point, I was ready to step back from this
for a bit.  However, my wife brought home three
more, who, I was assured, were in fine health.
Last night we lost one of them, though, again due
to sudden illness.<p>

This isn't what I signed up for. :(<p>

I have a funny "bat in the house" story, but I'll
save that for some other, less depressing time.
Sorry to be so dreary.<p>

<i>-Matt</i><p>

* - Why would a kitten need fostered?  Animal
Friends doesn't adopt out kittens until after 
they are spayed/neutered, and tested for feline
leukemia and FIV (feline AIDS).  They have to
be a certain age/weight to do those things, so
they stay at a foster house while they are 
growing, so as not to take shelter space away
from adoptable animals.<p></p>
