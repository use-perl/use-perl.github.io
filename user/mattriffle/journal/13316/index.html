<p>Attended MJD's Performance Tuning tutorial this morning.
He was entertaining as always, and I learned a good
deal.<p>

In the afternoon I attended the... worst... tutorial... ever.. 
(as The Simpson's Comic Book Guy would say).  I won't
identify it other than to say it wasn't in the Perl track.<p>

Basically the presenter just sat and read off his slides in
a low monotone.  Very, very disappointing.  I should've
taken the Perl testing tutorial.  Live, and learn.<p>

In happy happy happy news, I was awakened from an
afternoon nap (I'm not on West Coast time yet) by a call
from my sister.  It seems I'll have another niece or
nephew come next February. :)<p>

That blew away the wake-up call the hotel provided this
morning, no offense to the Mariott.<p>

Took a stroll around downtown Portland this afternoon.
My first impression (other than how pretty it is with all
of the trees) was that the nation's most honest panhandlers
live here.<p>

One had a sign that read "Homeless, blah blah, spare me
some change."  Another's read "I like to see people smile,
but why lie, I need a beer."<p>

There's some significance to the smile reference, though I
don't know what yet.  Another panhandler asked if we
could "spare a smile -- just one smile."<p>

Tomorrow I have the maintainable Perl tutorial, and the
MySQL new features workshop.  My wife and I then plan
to head to Powell's, to see what kind of damage we can
do to our bank account.<p>

<h2>Bad tutorial</h2>

Please identify it to me (gnat AT oreilly.com) so I can not have it again next year!  Thanks,<p>

<h2>Perl Testing Tutorial</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2003-07-08T06:17:36</h3>
<p>We're different.  We <em>stand</em> around, reading our slides in dull monotones.  Twice the entertainment for the same price!</p>
