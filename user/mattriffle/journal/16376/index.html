It seems a little overengineered and finished to me. Not much possibility of extending and experimenting, it's just setup, grab hold and glide.<br>Having just a rope between two trees and either a stick, or if we could get hold of it, a pulley to glide on adds a lot more play and excitement. Just the uncertainty of when (not if: when) you fall down - either due to your glider falling of the rope, or the rope breaking - helps enormously in adding to the excitement, not to mention doing wonders for your fall-techniques.<p>
I fear that we pamper our children much to much, and don't let them get the bumps and bruises they need during childhood. Everything is lined up and ready for them, there is no need for imagination or ingenuity with most modern toys - even Lego now comes in boxes with detailed instructions on how to build the models: in my childhood it was just a collection of building blocks, that you made your own models from.<br>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>
