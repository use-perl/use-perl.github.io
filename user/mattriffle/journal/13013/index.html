<p>Can a person spam his own journal? ;)<P>

Just wanted to link to
<a href="http://jobs.perl.org/job/824">this job</a>.  We have one opening now, and will
have a few more later this year.<p>

If you're in the Pittsburgh area, know Perl, and
need a job, then -- apply. :)<p>

I can testify that it's nice to work somewhere that
is PHB-free, and does things like contribute to
the Perl Foundation (ready to do so again once I
hear back from gnat), host PerlMonks, and so on.<p>

<p>I love pair. I've had an account for several years now. Could I telecommute for the job from Boston?</p>

<p>And please tell me the new programmers are going to implement an RPC interface for the account management software... That would be so awesome and let us other programmers write all kinds of nifty interfaces.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

No telecommuters at this time, sorry.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(</p><p><blockquote><div> <i>And please tell me the new programmers are going to implement an RPC interface<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</i> </div></blockquote> <p>

I really can't talk about it.</p><p>

Having said that, I will say that we're interested
in it, but it won't happen this year.  The
account management backend architecture is going
to get a thorough review, with improvements and
optimizations where needed.  That will be followed by a lot of the most frequently requested interface requests.</p><p>

After that, we can start thinking about the really, really nifty stuff.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  That would
include XML-RPC interfaces, though it's not
written in stone so I can't guarantee it
will happen.</p><p>

Hmm.  Didn't I just say I couldn't talk about
that...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)  I should point out that I'm not
speaking for the company at the moment, just
for myself.</p><p>

And why are there no Pair Networks programmers at Pittsburgh Perl Monger meetings?  eh?<br>

I only recently noticed that it had started back
up again, honestly.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<p>

The next meeting seems to conflict with OSCON, but
I will probably show up in August.  Some of the other guys might be there in July.</p><p>
