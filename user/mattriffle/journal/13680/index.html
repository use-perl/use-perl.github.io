<p>I accidentally wore my Perl Camel shirt out this evening.  I 
usually don't because I don't feel like explaining
it to people.<p>

The waitress at the restaurant was puzzled, but the
Cashier at Target just said "Thinkgeek?"<p>

Dunno what to make of that...<p>

<h2>Other interesting reactions</h2>

<p>When I wore mine to dinner with friends a few months ago, I had a conversation I had with their 10-year-old son. It went something like this.
</p><blockquote><div>
Kid: What does that say on the front of your shirt?<br>
Me: Um, it's the beginning of a program.  That first part's a shebang.<br>
Kid: A what?<br>
Me: A shebang.<br>
Kid: <i>(thinks for a few seconds)</i> That's cool.</div></blockquote>
Considering the source, I thought that was high praise.

You two are lucky.  I never get any inquiries for my geek shirts, and that's why I wear them!  (Except that they're mostly all I own, I go clothes shopping at conferences.  Mad props to the first company that gives away shorts!)<br>

That's one reason I miss the boom era -- I collected
enough t-shirts to clothe me for a month.<p>

I actually did just find an unopened vacuum-packed
shirt disk, which turned out to be for "ePanacea."
It's the darndest thing, but they seem to be out
of business now...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p><p>

I also found an Enron CD holder -- I'm keeping that
baby forever.</p><p>

It's not shorts, but it's close. By far and away the geekiest piece of clothing I have is a pair of boxers I got for free that say "Google" and "I'm feeling lucky!" on the front.
