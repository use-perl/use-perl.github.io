<p>My newest nephew, 
<a href="http://www.jennandmatt.com/albums/jacob">
Jacob Darrell Wallace</a>, was born this morning.
He weighed in at 8lbs 8oz, and is 21.5 inches long.
<p>
I tried very hard to will him to be a leap year
baby*, but apparently he was too anxious to get going to wait that long. :)<p>
<i>-Matt</i><p>

* - The predominant view in my family was that 
being born on 2/29 would be a bad thing.  I, however, think otherwise.  When Jacob is 60 and
wants to know why he can't tell people it's his
15th birthday, I (or my ghostly spirit, as the
case will probably be) will let him know I did
the best I could.</p>

I also became an uncle to a boy named Jacob in this past year, on July 17 (I<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/think/!)  My birthday is July 20, and I was hoping he could stick it out, but it didn't work out.  Stupid kids.  Back when I was a foetus, we didn't disappoint our elders like that.

<p>Same here, another Jacob on 22 March 2003.  Another few kiddoes and we'll have someone on the 22nd for every month of the year.</p>

If I couldn't have 2/29 I was holding out for 3/5, which is my birthday.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Oh well.<p>

I guess it was time for him to be born.  I mean, he
arrived with a

full head of hair</a jennandmatt.com>.</p><p>
