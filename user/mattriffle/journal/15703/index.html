<h2>head room in back?</h2>

Looks to me like the head room in back might be a bit cramped.

<h2>Great Car</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2003-11-12T20:58:01</h3>
I own the 2001 model and I absolutely love it.  Recently I was at the Toyota dealership and test drove the 2004 model.  It's very, very cool.  Here are some advantages the 2004 has over the 2001:
<p><ul>
<li>More HP - The 2001 has a total of 95 HP with the gas and electric combined.  The 2004 has a total of 145 HP with the gas an electric combined.  That being said, it didn't feel *that* much more powerful.</li>
<li>Improved suspension - it was definitely a smoother ride.</li>
<li>Back seats fold down - nice improvement, although they had to make the car a little bigger, and it doesn't technically qualify as a compact car any more.</li>
<li>Improved mileage.  Mine is 52/45.  The 2004 model is 60/51.</li>
<li>More gizmos</li>
</ul>
The only drawback is that the controls seem more complicated, but I'm sure that's something I could get used to.
<p>
Regarding the head room - there's plenty.  The 2004 body isn't quite as bubbled as the 2001, but it's no worse than your average mid-size car.  My car is actually *taller* than most mid-size cars, so there's actually more headroom.
</p><p>
A note on power - it's good.  I've driven mine from Denver to Telluride (SW Colorado) and taken it over 12,000 feet at Rocky Mountain National Forest and have absolutely no problem.  Remember, the AC motor generates gobs of torque (more than most heavy duty vehicles), so it makes going up hills relatively painless.
</p><p>
I'll probably wait until the 2005 model comes out, just because I'm still paying this one off.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
