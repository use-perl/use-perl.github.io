<p>After that mysterious problem that took down my computer some time ago, I was convinced to install anything but RedHat (RPM dependency hell being all too familiar to me on this particular machine). However, as I proceeded through several other operating systems, I found (quite to my dismay) that RedHat seems to be the only one that likes the combination of my video card, monitor, and mouse to be able to run X without a tremendous effort. Neither Debian (potato and woody), nor Free or OpenBSD would show me any love.<br><br><br/><br/>Being overloaded as it is with school work (genomics, thesis, and all the other odds and ends), I couldn't find time to determine quite <i>why</i> none of the other OSes would give me a simple working X install, but alas, none would.<br><br><br/><br/>The one exception to this, though not involving X specifically, was the wonderful BeOS (yow - dano rocks on this box). This is such a beautiful (both technically and in interface) OS, that it pains me to think that such a work could go so amazingly under appreciated ... Unfortunately the /dev/random driver needed to use ssh sporatically causes the input_server to hang. Oh well.<br><br><br/><br/>So it's back to my nemesis RedHat for the time being, because at this point, getting things done is probably more important than matters of taste.<br><br><br/><br/>It's very nice to be back on a functioning development box; And to be able to use MySQL, PostgreSQL <i>and</i> Sybase (not to mention that super-neat <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Matts/journal/3042">SQLite</a>) all on one box (after developing under OSX for quite some time) is such a joy! So it is that work continues on the rewritten version 2 of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=BingoX">BingoX</a> (after much pressuring from Wonko).<br><br><br/><br/>Right... now it's back to the Philosophy.<br><br><br/><br/>(on the playlist lately are <i>Handbags and Gladrags</i> by Stereophonics, and the <i>Am&eacute;lie</i> soundtrack, of which I can't seem to get enough)</p>

Strangely, it looks like my original comment didn't make it.  That's odd.
<p>
Anyway, check out www.openbeos.org for the "latest" in BeOS development.</p>
