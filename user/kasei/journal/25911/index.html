<p><p>Wow. It's been a while since I logged in here. Just over three years, in fact. I've been reading the new posts and journals in an aggregator during that time, but I quite fell out of the practice of posting updates of my own. Part of that may have been due to the burnout of trying to cram an understanding of the perl internals and compiler suite into my head in too short a time.</p>

<p>In the mean time, I've been doing quite a bit of work on <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/SimplePhotoAnnotation">photo annotation</a> in RDF, <a href="http://kasei.us/archives/categories/projects/rdf-query/">implementing</a> a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/">SPARQL</a> query engine in perl, and <a href="http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/Publications/CEUR-WS//Vol-135/paper5.pdf">RDF-enabling a weblogging system</a>. Oh, and doing quite a bit of traveling and taking lots of photos.</p>

<p>I'm coming back, partly because I miss being involved (in whatever small way) in the perl community, and partly to help some friends. I've been asked to help out on a book being written that will involve lots of perl, to make sure it sits well with the perl community, and to ensure the programming aspects follow best practices and good style. In this, I hope to be able to leverage support from a community such as use Perl, and hope some of you might be so kind as to provide feedback and support when I need it. Anyway, I'll post more about that project as it unfolds.</p>

<p>So, it feels good to be back, and I hope this time I'll stick around.</p></p>
