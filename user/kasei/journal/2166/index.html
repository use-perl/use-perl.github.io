<p>There were some slight mumblings on the Apache::XPP list yesterday... I'm a bit surprised, but somewhat glad to see that people are actually using XPP - it's been about 18 months since I worked on it (during the days when I was paid to do open source), and the mailing list is typically quite; I'm glad that I can maintain it for people who are using it, and apply patches that are sent in.<BR><BR><br/><br/>Who was it who said (in a use Perl journal I think) that page parsers were one of those things which everybody has written. It's funny because it's true - when XPP was first written there were very few page parsers available, none of which were as minimal as what we needed. As time went on, however, XPP grew bigger, and the reasons for developing it were mostly the time investment and existing projects using it, since it grew closer and closer to other parsers with each revision. Ah well - I still use it (I helped design it, so it fits the way I think very closely).<BR><BR><br/><br/>In the OSX world, I downloaded and tried iPhoto yesterday. Maybe I just don't get it, but it seems like a pretty poor piece of software. There are so many cool things that it <I>could</I> do, but I find that most of it (after about an hour of use) is just unintuitive. Maybe it's time for an open-source replacement...</p>
