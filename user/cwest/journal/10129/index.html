<p>Tonight and (at least) tomorrow are going to be days to dislike.  My daughter has a cold, and she can't be out tomorrow with a wind chill of -10 scheduled for all day.  Since my wife has the job that requires her to leave the house, she'll be doing so.  I'll be trying my best to work from home.  Good luck to me.  The wireless at home offsets the 56k connection woes just a tad.  I also have the gas men comming to fix the leak tomorrow at 8am, though if they're anything like the boss it will be 1pm, after I call three times to remind them of what they promised.<br/><br/>In other news, I now grok HTML::Mason pretty well and I'm building pages for the new web site.  I can do a fair amount of that even without a modem, perhaps I will.<br/><br/>It's time for me to go back home and tend to a sick child.  What makes this tough, you might ask?  My baby is fully mobile.  She can crawl, walk, stand up without using other object, climb stairs and fall down them.  Catching her with a tissue is no easy task, let alone the evil nose sucker.  She isn't even one year old yet!<br/><br/>
