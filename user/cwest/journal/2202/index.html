<p>Someone lied to me tonight.  They told me I'm not a "Real Speaker" here at the GeekCruise.  I wonder what I am, then.  I came under the premise of giving a talk as a speaker.<br/><br/>I'm a victim of the politics and class system I don't believe in.<br/><br/>I won't get jaded, that would be taking 17 steps backward.  Instead I'll realize that, just because I'm not a Name(tm) to this person, I still had fun giving my talk.  I guess I just wish I wasn't suprised <i>at</i> the Speaker Q&A, I would have liked to have been warned that I wouldn't be participating.  I feel kinda like a dork for being excited and telling folks (like my wife and boss) that I'd be doing it.<br/><br/>Perhaps at the next conference I'll be able to do the things that "Real Speakers" do.  ;-)<br/><br/></p>

It's so asinine (and inane besides) to for someone to say that you aren't a "real speaker", that I rather hope it was just a misphrased/misunderstood comment that weas really intended to mean something else.  (Altho what the intended meaning would be, I have no idea.)

When venting here I failed to consider, until some minutes later, that I could have misconstrued the meaning somehow.  I still don't know what other meaning it couldv'e been but I know I've been guilty of such things in the past as well, and quite unintentionally.
<br>
<br>No worries, as I said.

I don't know the entire context, but it could be meant as a compliment: "you're not a real speaker.  You actually know what you are talking about."

If you stand up in front of people and speak, you're a speaker.  Everything else is pay scale and billing.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

Don't let it get you down.  You're visiting Paradise, getting in one of the last Fun Things you'll do before children turn your life into an endless parade of nappies and Advil, and regardless of whether you're called real, virtual, static, or inherited from the superclass, you're living a life the rest of us can only envy.</p><p>
