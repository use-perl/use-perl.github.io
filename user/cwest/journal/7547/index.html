the agenda, please email me and we'll work it in.  If you would like
to talk during any month, please let me know.  I am particularly

problems in Perl for work or play.<br/><br/>Some of us may choose to head downstairs to the Clark Bar & Grill for
food and drink after the meeting, or as soon as it gets boring.<br/><br/>This month's meeting, and all meetings in the foreseeable future, will
be held at the scenic conference room of Agnew Moyer Smith, Inc on the
north side.  They will be providing a projector and seating for up to
twenty of us.  Parking is located all around the building.<br/><br/>  Agnew Moyer Smith, Inc
