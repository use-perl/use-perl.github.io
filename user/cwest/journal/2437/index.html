<p>I've cleaned my office.  In doing so I've tripled the size of my UEOs (Unidentified Electronic Objects).  This time, though, I've managed to not greatly increase it's uselessness.  I found stuff I could actually use!<br/><br/>Now, I have an extra computer that I happen to know has a linux usable modem.  Problem is, I was using it under RedHat 5.2 and I don't remember how to do that again.  No matter, I'll get it working.<br/><br/>I also have a hub and I should be able to get dial-on-demand working.  This should be fairly cool until Aaronsen gets my satellite hook-up rolling.  When they do that, I'm hoping for two-way, I'll need another computer to run windows and run the gateway software.  Or this is what their documentation tells me.  Perhaps they just said that because they have some USB equipment.<br/><br/>Now my desk is bare, after an evening of festivities I'll have to decorate with posters, stickers and amusing toys and puzzles.  And a lava lamp, what desk is complete without one?  Just have to get it from the office in town.<br/><br/></p>
