<p>We really need to invent a new mode of transportation.  It has to be private, not public transportation.  And one that you don't have to have a title, owners card, insurance card, drivers liscence, inspection, emmissions test, tune up on.<br/><br/>C'mon, can't we manage to relieve ourselves of this oppression?  On the other hand, if I were to just walk or bike to my destinations.  Anything over 5 miles really becomes a pain in the butt.  Really.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if I were in shape I could surely run 5 miles in 30 minutes.  Sure, that's a bit longer than 5 miles in 7 minutes with a car but, it's cheaper.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best inventions are the old inventions.<br/><br/>

I was trying to take into account averages, driving a 60mph speed limit, and glitches in the matrix that we can't anticipate.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<br>
<br>Plus, 5 miles from me in any direction is rural suburbia.  Speed limits are lucky to get past 45 mph.
<br>
<br>I don't like tickets.  On the otherhand, I'm don't have to drive on the road with my Jeep.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

You know what it's called.  Don't make me repeat it here...starts with an S-, ends with an -egway...
