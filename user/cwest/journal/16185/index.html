<p><p class="hft-paras">She knows when we walk out of the house and turn left, we're walking to
Grandma's house. There is a difference between noise and music, and she
points them out appropriately. When it's night time she points out the
moon. When in the car, she knows what roads lead directly to Grandma's
house. There's no reason to cry when other babies are crying. When I say
&quot;I put the keys in mommy's pocket&quot; she repeats it as &quot;Put the keys in
the pocket of mommy's.&quot; If I tell her to sing a song about something she
incorporates it into a song with other words, and the subject is never
the first word.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">I find her amazing. I don't know where she stands when it comes to other
kids who are 21 months. She dances, walks, climbs stairs, sings, talks,
and shows her personality and character every single day. In the morning
I tell Evelina that mommy's in the kitchen and she tells me things like,
&quot;Mommy in kitchen cooking oatmeal.&quot;</p>

<p class="hft-paras">When I got back from ApacheCon my wife was telling me a story about
Evelina's doctor appointment while I was away. Right in the middle of
the conversation Evelina chimed in and told me about the doctor. She was
right in step with the conversation and told me something she remembered
from days prior. Like I said, I just think she's wonderful.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">On to something that isn't just parental ego wanking. It would seem that
Evelina is learning at a rapid pace, and I'm not certain we're keeping
up with appropriate toys, videos, books, or activities. Parents, do you
suggest any particular early child-hood development programs?
Pennsylvania isn't paying very good attention to early education so I
need to ensure Evelina gets what she needs from my wife and me.</p>
