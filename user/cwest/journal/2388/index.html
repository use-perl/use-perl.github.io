<div class="span8">
<p>Finally got my jeep back.  I forgot how much I like it.  This Christmas, my wife bought me a <a href="http://rocknob.com">Rock Nob</a> for the gear shift.  It was much too cold to touch without gloves until now, we're having a heat wave.  It's uber cool.<br/><br/>I checked my inspection sticker to see when I have to get the thing inspected again.  Dec, 2002 was on the sticker.  Why?  I thought they were good for a year, not 11 months.<br/><br/>Most people would stop here and say the inspectors are just stupid idiots. I am able to look past that and realize that it's actually very smart.  I can't complain about the sticker, or ignore it.  I have no choice but to go and get it inspected in 11 months.  This means that I'll have to get 13 inspections in the next 12 years and they'll make an extra 50 bucks on me.<br/><br/>For one vehicle, that seems like too much work for such little pay off.  But if they inspect an average of 10 cars a day, 5 days a week, 50 weeks a year at 50 USD that's: 125000 USD.  <b>Except</b> in the 12th year, they'll have to put in overtime (which should be happening every year, having many customers) they'll double that and get 250000 USD.<br/><br/>Not such a bad business plan.

<h2>Inspection Mistake</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/krellis/">krellis</a> on 2002-01-24T20:00:54</h3>
<p>A Dec, 2002 sticker sounds more like a mistake than anything else.  Could be that you PA folks are weird, but everywhere I've heard of has inspections that are valid for some integer number of years.  You might want to at least call them and ask what's up with that.  Or does the sticker really mean that it's valid through Dec, 2002, and you have to get it inspected sometime in Jan, 2003?  That'd be kinda weird, though...</p>



<h2>8 Ball Shift Knob</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jbisbee/">jbisbee</a> on 2002-01-24T20:08:51</h3>
I have drive a 99 Sahara now and back in my college days I had a 86 Renegade CJ7.  An old ratty shift knob came with the jeep and I figured I needed a new one.  I went to a billards store and bought a 8 ball and drilled a hole in it (very carefully) just big enough that it would catch the threads of my Jeep's shifter.  Well it worked and I ended up having an 8 ball for my shift knob.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

8 balls are cool an all but, for a Jeep that belongs off road, only a rock will do.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<br>
<br>I couldn't bare to dress up my jeep with anything other than Mother Nature herself.
<br>
<br>Now, if I had an old boat of a monte carlo.. and I were a pimp...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
