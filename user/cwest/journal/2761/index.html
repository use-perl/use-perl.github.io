<p>Well, tomorrow morning around 7am we're being admitted into the hospital for induced labor.  I'm going to have a little girl tomorrow and I'm more excited than I thought I would be.<br/><br/>I'm bringing a big bag full of technology to the hospital, and a bag of clothes and medicine for me.  (She's packed her own.)<br/><br/>I'll be out of commission for a while but I hope to have some pictures of a lovely family of three by Wednesday or so.<br/><br/>Keep us in your prayers.  :-)<br/><br/></p>

W00t!  Best of luck to you and Chastity, Casey!  I'm sure everything'll turn out great for you.  We'll hold you to that promise of those pictures!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>Congratulations!</h2>

Too soon to learn Perl?  I don't think there is such a thing!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Would there be a market for CDs with Damian and Wall talks mixed with Mozart?  "Studies show that infants exposed to these accompanied lectures from the womb grow up to be smarter, wittier, and more organized."

Frankly, I wouldn't take anything techno to the hospital, because I know me.  The baby would come and I'd be chasing down a hook-up for my Palm . . . but that's probably just me.
<p>
Good luck to ya'll!  I'm sure it'll all come out well!</p>

When it's my time, I'm taking a laptop computer for music and, if required, DVDs.  I am taking my Palm for wireless Internet access and my cell phone for people to track me down in emergencies, though they'll both be off the whole time we're in there (probably leave them in the car or something).  And I'll have the digital camera, which won't be used much pre-birth and not at all during birth (yuck).<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
