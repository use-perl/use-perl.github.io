<p>Every once and again, probably more often that you'd like to admit, there is a point where you realize you're not bad off.<br/><br/>Just a while ago, I drove to my house to pick up lunch.  When I came back, the parking lot was full of cars and people.  I park in the local fire hall parking lot.  They were all there for the Food Bank.  If you're poor enough, you sign up, come, and get free food.<br/><br/>Now sure, some of them are there because (in a manner of speaking) they choose to be poor.  Others are widows or single parents without marketable skills, still others are just too old to support themselves.  All in all I'd guess the majority of them are poor for reasons beyond their control (or immediate control, perhaps they made choices early on that put them in the position they are in).<br/><br/>Now, I complain about the sandwich I get for lunch because I don't feel like eating ham today.  It's then that I realize how fortunate I am.  Not only am I able to afford the ham myself, but I can choose to have something different.  I'm not in the position of taking white bread, I can buy my 12 grain bread.<br/><br/>While I don't attribute things in my life to luck, I certainly realize that it wasn't all my fault that I am able to afford these things.  My mother and others in my life pushed me in a direction that would allow me to care for a family.  I've lived a life of eating from the Food Bank when I was young.<br/><br/>I suppose all I have to say is that I'm thankful for my lot in life and I should complain less for what I do have.  Perhaps I should consider this when I pout because I can't afford an iBook, at least I can afford cereal.

I wish your perspective were more common.
<p>I wonder: Why is the economy structured such that people even need to go to the food bank?</p>
