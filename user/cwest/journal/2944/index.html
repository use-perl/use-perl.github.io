<p>We used to have a modest Giant Eagle near town.  It was large, large enough that it put a local Shop n' Save out of business.  It also pretty much had a monopoly here and unless you wanted to travel a fair distance, it was the only option.<br/><br/>It must have done well because on Sunday a new, Super Duper Giant Eagle was opened.  This store is really huge.  They had a grand opening and Chastity and I didn't know this.  We went to the store to shop yesterday and so did everyone else in Pennsylvania, or so it seemed.<br/><br/>In my old age, I think I'm beginning to like the idea of small local markets.

I always shop at my local co-op.  It costs a bit more but they have much better produce (fresher), lots of organic stuff, they don't sell GMO food, and they pay their employees a fair wage with benefits.  The employees are really helpful and friendly and they get to know you.
<br>
<br>Plus they carry the things I want (I'm vegan).
<br>
<br>Every dollar you spend is a choice about the world you want.  If you want small, pleasant markets where people know you and who will actually respond to customer requests then shop at one.
<br>
<br>Or you can keep shopping at your local mega-market and watch all the small businesses disappear.  Its your choice.
<br>
<br>Of course, if there is no local small market anymore then you're really stuck.

I like large "mega-markets".  Mmmm mmm good.  Small businesses are too small.

Uh, okay.  You're free to vote with your dollars too.  I can't really force you to go to a small store.<br> <br>I've never gone to my local co-op and wished I were at a big market though.  They mostly have the things I want, and certainly there's nothing at the supermarket I want that the co-op doesn't have.  Though there are still things noone around here has that I'd like.

Do you live in Pittsburgh or western PA? If so, where at?

Nice -- I'm in Squirrel Hill, working downtown myself. I don't know how many other pittsburgh folks are around here...

Well, sounds like time to have a Pittsburgh Perl Mongers meeting...
