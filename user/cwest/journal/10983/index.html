<p>A working UPS is good too, but that is not the issue.  I've finally come up with my own computer naming scheme.  Everyone has their own, mine is coffee related.  The iBook is called espresso, backup server is ristretto, and mail server is doppio.  I've got a PowerMac coming, and I'm confused about what to use next.  As far as keeping in touch with my client machine, the iBook, I should call it coffee.  Sadly, coffee seems lame.  Suggestions welcome, I was thinking about roast types but I think I'll wait for roast types when I have a lot of computers to name.<br/><br/>In other news, I've finished a chapter in the prescrbed week and that makes me happy.  I went to a coffee shop on Friday and I've never worked so well.  Real life is very distracting.  I may be working offline, at cozy locations a couple times a week.  And when I started talking coffee with the girl at the register, she handed me an application.  They want to know how many words per minute I type, and if I can use Word and Excel for Windows.  They also want to know how I was effective at customer service at my last job.  Yeah.<br/><br/>Posted from <a href="http://caseywest.com">caseywest.com</a>, comment <a href="http://caseywest.com/journal/archives/000103.html">here</a>.</p>
