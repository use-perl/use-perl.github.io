<p>I made those pancakes, and they were surprisingly good.  After that I spent quite a while downloading and installing apache with mod_perl.  After that, there was much talking about Perl and the theory of Perl Conferences.<br/><br/>I was able to get a ride to the hotel for the PerlBugAthon.  This was a very attended event with Robert Spier, Aurtor Bergman, Leon Brocard, coraline, a random subversion developer that had nothing better to do, Piers Cawley, coraline, Ziggy, hydo, Bill Odom, and myself.  I'm sure there were others, comment to add yourself.  By 6:00 pm (PDT) we squashed one hundred bugs!  A wild success, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Dinner was 20 of us at a great Chinese place.  I finally caught up with Andy (who's plane was horribly delayed), and now I've got a place to stay.<br/><br/>My wife is now having a party back at home without me.  It's for the best, as I've got lots of people to hang with here.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Posted from <a href="http://caseywest.com">caseywest.com</a>, comment <a href="http://caseywest.com/journal/archives/000159.html">here</a>.</p>
