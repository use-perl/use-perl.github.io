<p>Yesterday I took some much needed time off to spend the day with my wife.  I've never had so much fun.  With sixty-five dollars cash we had a good time at Station Square without the baby.  I got a hair cut, something I've needed for about six months.  We had snacks, ate a nice meal, parked for free, and rented some movies for home.  Contrasting yesterday are my normal days, at the office from 8am to 10pm with obvious breaks for one or two meals.  I'm at the office too much because I feel guilty leaving when /everything/ isn't finished.  Needless to say, I need some restructuring.<br/><br/>The curse is of course what happens to you after just one day of relaxation.  It's so hard for me to concentrate and get things done again.  I keep thinking about my wife (I know, it's a hard life).  Thankfully I was reminded by her of what Chris said when I came to work for Dyn.  Something about him kicking my butt if I don't pay attention to her.  Good man.<br/><br/>So back to work it is, though not with such a frightening schedule.  Perhaps twelve hours instead of fourteen.  (Just kidding!)<br/><br/>On a similar note, the weather has been tremendous here, and I'm really excited about getting out on the porch this afternoon for some work.  In fact, after lunch I may do just that.  It's a sacrafice leaving the PowerMac, but it's well worth it.<br/><br/>Posted from <a href="http://caseywest.com">caseywest.com</a>, comment <a href="http://caseywest.com/journal/archives/000117.html">here</a>.</p>
