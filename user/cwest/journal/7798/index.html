<p>Yesterday was a good day.  Got off the plane safely, found the train station, got a train, found my hotel, and found YAPC::EU without troubles.  I stayed at The Venue till about 18:00 when I left with Allison, Hugo, and Damian for non-werst foods.<br/><br/>We found a wonderful Italian place.  I've obviously never had real Italian food because this looked nothing like anything I've ever seen and it tasted orders of magnitude better.<br/><br/><i>Update: I should mention that, for the first time in my life, I managed to go into the Ladies bathroom to relieve myself.  You see, of all the words I looked up and learned before I set foot here, I forgot "Man" and "Woman".  I now know that Damen is not German for "men".</i><br/><br/>Then we went for ice cream and met up with some Belfast.pm folks I met at Perl Whirl.  That was great fun.  Again, I must have never had real ice cream befire, even the ice cream is better here.<br/><br/>Finally Hugo, Belfast.pm, and I went to find the gastolf.  I forced myself out after saying hi because I desperatley needed to sleep.  I'm glad I did that because the sleep was much needed.  The walk back to my hotel was interesting in the same way a walk to your hotel in New York is interesting.

I thought you said you were going to learn some German on your flight!  Now I feel a little guilty for teaching you how to decipher a German beer menu, but not how to choose the right restroom.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
