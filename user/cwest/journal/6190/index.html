<p>In my neck of the woods we set off fireworks at a friends house.  Nothing too outstanding since most interesting and expensive fireworks are illegal in Pennsylvania.  I'm kind of a pyro so I set to work lighting a bunch of fireworks with a blow torch.  I also enjoyed lighting the spinning fireworks and tossing them like a grenade into the air.<br/><br/>With all the fireworks burned I tried to sit down on a platform we set up for the fireworks and when I did I realized that there was nothing supporting the middle of this thin piece of ply-wood.  How did I know?  When the lantern that was on it fell over onto my back.  2nd degree burns ensued.<br/><br/>One of my friends dumped salt on me.  I was a little nervous about that but it did help with the pain.  Right now I'm just irritated by everything touching it and I'm trying not to move at all.

I had to keep 9 kids (ages 4-11) under control in my backyard yesterday as they held sparklers.  No one stuck a lit one under anyone's nose.  No one dropped a red-hot sparkler under someone's bare feet.  And none of the babies in the vicinity got burned.
<p>Pretty good riot control.</p>
