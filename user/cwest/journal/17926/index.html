<p><p class="hft-paras">I've noticed over the past four winters that I may struggle with SAD.
It might just be the &quot;winter blue&quot; but I suspect it isn't. I've never
really looked into Seasonal Depression until recently. I found a
decent summary.</p>

<p class="hft-paras"><a href="http://www.clevelandclinic.org/health/health-info/docs/2300/2361.asp" class="hft-urls">http://www.clevelandclinic.org/health/health-info/docs/2300/2361.asp</a>?-
index=9293</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Interestingly, four years ago I started working in offices full time, as
opposed to a mixture of school and work. My work places have
consistently had very little to no natural light, and very low levels of
artificial light.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">For some reason I never thought to attribute the way I feel during the
winter months to light. My little corner of the planet gets pretty
dark in the winter months, pretty early. And the sun doesn't come up
when I like to get up either. They say light can make all the
difference. I've also removed almost all exercise from my life in the
winter, another problem.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">This year I think I did pretty well, but last week wasn't good and
was set off by an unfortunate event that happened three years ago
in my life.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">The Funk is hard to get out of, but I'm working through it. I'd rather
not see a doctor about it, and if I did it'd be a little late this year.
I guess I'll have to see how next year goes.</p>
