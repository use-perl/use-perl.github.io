<h1>The Problems Inherent with Swallowing a Chill Pill</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p class="hft-paras">Recently I've been relaxing. A lot. Not the &quot;couch potato&quot;, &quot;sitting
around&quot; kind of relaxing most may be used to. I'm referring to the more
interesting variety, the Chill Pill method.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">The title of this essay assumes I'll rant on about this situation I've
got, and I will. First I'd like to address the Good Things. Taking a
Chill Pill (&quot;the Pill&quot;) has effected change in a number of areas in my
life. Let's review.</p>

<p class="hft-paras"><strong class="hft-bold">Work</strong></p>

<p class="hft-paras">The most improved area of my life is my work. Just like most of us I'm
asked to put in a solid 7.4 hours a day, minimum, to work a full-time
week. Also like most of us I was constantly paranoid about my job which
lead to highly defensive stances on points of little substance. When I
took the Pill I decided not to worry about it, to do my job the best I
could, and to enjoy doing it. This has increased my level of happiness
vastly, which in turn has increased my output.</p>

<p class="hft-paras"><strong class="hft-bold">Home</strong></p>

<p class="hft-paras">I used to be a tired wreck when I arrived home after work. I think this
was largely due to the emotional way I conducted myself there. After the
Pill things have been different. I recently took up cleaning as an
evening hobby. While Chastity feeds the baby or gets our kids washed up
I clean the living room and wash the dishes. Cleaning is very euphoric,
and a nice way to wind down at the end of a day.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">The practice of cleaning my home at night has effected change in my
mornings. With clothes put away at night, waking up to my bedroom is not
so terrible. The day greets me with freshness and a crisp morning glow
instead of a pile of junk here and there, or laundry to do.</p>

<p class="hft-paras"><strong class="hft-bold">Scheduling</strong></p>

<p class="hft-paras">As a result of the changes in Work and Home, my schedule has been
effected. I'm waking up around seven consistently, and at work between
nine and ten in the morning. This means I come home at an expected time,
around 6:30 in the evening. I have the evening to do as I please,
usually eating and playing with children, then cleaning when they're
getting ready for bed. This gives Chastity and I enough time to read
before we go to sleep around eleven.</p>

<p class="hft-paras"><strong class="hft-bold">Family</strong></p>

<p class="hft-paras">A good book says &quot;order brings peace.&quot; It's right. My day is very
peaceful. Structure in my life has changed the lives of my family as
well. I get to see my daughter every day instead of hit-or-miss, for
example. My wife doesn't have such a burden around the house because I
help her out when I get home.</p>

<p class="hft-paras"><strong class="hft-bold">Eating</strong></p>

<p class="hft-paras">As it turns out, having a schedule and a less frantic family helps with
nutrition. I have time for breakfast in the morning. Because I'm getting
home form work at a reasonably predictable time Chastity can make dinner
for us all at once (and she's a good cook).</p>

<p class="hft-paras"><strong class="hft-bold">Other Work</strong></p>

<p class="hft-paras">Now that I'm not living moment to moment, I have time for things I
enjoy. I have time to write, time to have picnics with my daughter in
the front lawn, time to goof.</p>

<p class="hft-paras"><strong class="hft-bold">Problems</strong></p>

<p class="hft-paras">I mentioned I'd talk about the problems. There is only one that I've
noticed so far. When you slow down and enjoy life everyone else seems to
speed up out of control. So in the end you feel good but the urge to cut
your head off and flap about like a chicken is strong. Resist that urge
and I think you'll be happy. I am.</p>
