<p>It has been a while since I've written a journal entry.<br/><br/>Since my last entry I've landed a new position, letting me work from home.  This is good because I can constructivley use 2 hours that I lost to driving to work, and more importantly, I'm at home with my wife.<br/><br/>The US has been under attack.  As you know, I'm in Pittsburgh and some dork called a rumor hotline saying bombs were going to blowup at various locations around Pittsburgh.  It was false and the guy is in jail.  He'll be there for a while.  Good.<br/><br/>sheriff_p proded me to do something I was threatening about since TPC, cleaning up the Standard Documentation.  As a result of my email, I've been unofficialy named documentation manager, which I accept.  :-)<br/><br/>I look at what Schwern is doing in QA, not terribly exciting work, but certainly very important work.  I like doing that kind of stuff because no one else wants to.  It's harder to clean up documentation than it is to fix a bug, because it's more fun to fix a bug.<br/><br/>Join perl-documentation@perl.org and hop on board!
