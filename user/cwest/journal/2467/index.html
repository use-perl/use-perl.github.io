<p>I watched my team suddenly morph into last years offense.  I watched my punter turn into a rookie decision maker.  I watched Kris Brown do well.<br/><br/>That's right folks, the Steelers lost, to the Patriots.  It was hard to see the better team lose.<br/><br/>That's ok.<br/><br/>New England will defeat the Rams in the Superbowl, a terrific upset.  Hey, I am a man who sticks with his home team, division, conference.  I enjoy setting fire to the band wagon.

The better team never loses, by definition, unless there was some cheating.

Apparently, you must have missed some of those Superbowls in the 80's and 90's, where some loser AFC team would beat the better team because the better team decided not to show up that day.
<p>
They would then go on to get crushed in the Superbowl because they had no business being there.

I had Pittsburgh to win it all.  Now, I fear, it will be the Rams.</p>

No.  The better team is defined by who wins the game.  That is all.  The Patriots right now are better than the Steelers, period.
<br>
<br>And the Pats have as much of a chance to win this as St. Louis!  Both are on 8-game winning streaks.  The Pats beat every team that is "better" than they are during that streak: Pittsburgh, Miami, NY Jets, Oakland.  Their last loss was Nov. 18, a 24-17 loss to<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... St. Louis.  And a Rams coach said after the game they hoped they didn't have to play New England again.
<br>
<br>Everyone picked Pittsburgh to beat New England, but the Patriots proved to be a better team, by definition.  Everyone thinks St. Louis is a shoo-in, but the Rams know better.
