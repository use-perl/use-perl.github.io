<p>I got to watch the sun come up over the Atlantic Ocean today.  Very... blue.  It would have been other colors but there was too much cloud cover on the horizon to see the pretty colors.<br/><br/>And, the espresso bar isn't open this time in the morning!  What do they expect of us?!  :-)</p>

<h2>Mmm... Atlantic sunrises</h2>

A few years back I got flown over to Boston on business and sat through a succession of terrible meetings (the project was going nowhere, the team was underresourced, and management still thought that Waterfall was the way to go...) with the client.
<br>
<br>So, the day before we were due to leave (we flew out at lunchtime), I hired a car and, at 2 in the morning set off from the Cambridge Hilton up the coast to Rockport (it seemed like a good idea at the time), arriving there at 0430, just before the sun got up. The sky was the most amazing colour as I rigged my tripod and camera and framed a view through the harbour mouth to the sunrise, made the shot and sat back to enjoy the show. Of course, the film was black and white, but I still have a fine print of it hung on my wall, it's one of my favourite photographs and reminds me that it's generally good to grab a moment when you can.
<br>
<br>Afterwords I took a leisurely drive back to Boston, stopping to watch as the Lynne firebrigade fought (and failed) to save an old wooden building (terribly sad, but the locals seemed to think it was probably an insurance job, the house had been empty for years), and then stopping again at what appeared to be Boston's only diner 'Where you're only a stranger once'.
<br>
<br>That whole morning made up for a lot. And the fact that the boss was the only person in our party who didn't swing an upgrade on the flight back helped too.
