<p class="hft-paras">Okay, maybe not all grown up. Chastity and I decided that Pi day,
also Einstein's birthday, was an excellent day to start school. So
off she went.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">When Chastity picked Evelina up from school and asked her how it went
Evelina said she didn't want to talk about it. Later, on the phone, she
told me that she's not talking about preschool because &quot;I already talked
about it all morning Daddy.&quot; Thankfully I was able to get her to say
that she liked it and she wants to go again.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">So now it begins, the horrible paranoia parents face. Did we get her the
best, the most, the proper education? Did we screw her up by starting
too early, too late, at all? Either way I think she's going to do well.</p>
