<p>Well, I've started planning the "Who's code is it anyway?" BOF.  Improv at it's ... I'd rather not say.  Should be very funny though.  Nat and Damian are my regulars, I'm still looking to fill the other two lucrative spots.  Some names have come up.. we shall see.<br/><br/>My employer, Aaronsen Group may be teaming up with DynDNS (see Krellis) to give you all one kick butt LAN Party at the lobby bar.  We've contacted ORA and they dig it.  So far it's looking like this: some kind of scheme to provide some free drinks, gaming class machines (perhaps donated by a cool manufacturer), high-speed networking and internet, wireless access and a dj.  It should be great, hopefully the numbers aren't blown out of proportion by the hotel or the equipment rentals.  It's still not official so we'll keep our fingers crossed.<br/><br/></p>

<h2>'proportion'?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2002-05-02T04:55:02</h3>
<p>If I paid $9 for a triple shot espresso last year, an open bar will not be anywhere near the price you might be hoping for. Think extortion. </p>

<p>Also, recall the movie Risky Business and think about the phrase 'kick butt'; It's "kick ass" Casey, if you can't say it, you can't do it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) You could also use more sophisticated words like swinging soiree or something which doesn't contain a word needing to be obfuscated<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I commend Casey on his choice of words!  Be different, Casey!  Think for yourself!  Because I told you so, that's why!
