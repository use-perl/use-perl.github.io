<p><blockquote class="hft-blockparas"><p>And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a
loud voice, &quot;Lazarus, come forth.&quot; And he that
was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with
graveclothes: and his face was bound about with
a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, &quot;Loose him, and
let him go.&quot;
  -- John 11:43-44, KJV</p></blockquote>

<p class="hft-paras">Once lost in time and space, Tom Christiansen's noble work has been
restored. The Perl Power Tools once served as a feather in Perl's cap.
Tens of developers flocked, submitted, and patched. Due to a horrible
hard disk crash, the project stood still in time. One day, the
unthinkable. Gone were the last vestiges, erased from the face of the
Internet.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">In my quest to uncover the original works from days past, I struggled
many days. Google was no help, it had forgotten. language.perl.com is no
longer the resource of yore, it was lost. No one had a copy saved, for
its stagnation had brought it doom. Lo! But what does locate uncover in
the furthest reaches of my backup server? Yes, it's a silhouette too
familiar, victory approaches! Shaking off the dust, unpacking the
tarball, it is the mysterious Perl Power Tools of days past.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Moving though the directories I find the original website. Pressing on,
the original sources representing countless developers' toils. Still
further, the treasure chest. Locked in utility scripts, hidden in
__DATA__, lay Tom's true goal. Hundreds of tools he sought to emulate,
to bring to the world on Perl's high hump.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Lost no more. Hours I slaved. Rebuilding the source, creating a master
index, uncovering the ambition of one fearless hacker. Tool by tool,
contribution by contribution, no stone left unturned, I finished the
resurrection.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Humbly I offer, as my gift to fellow Perl hackers, the Unix
Reconstruction Project in full glory. Armed with mailing list[1],
distribution[2], and website[3], the PPT may once again take its place
in Perl's powerful cap.</p>
