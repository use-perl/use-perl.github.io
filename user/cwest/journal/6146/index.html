<p>Today I drove into work.  My boss wants me to work on some things here, fair enough.  It took 70 minutes to reach my destination and now I'm completley dazed and out of touch with my senses.  I could have been programming for 70 minutes now.<br/><br/>Along my commute some random dude in a Trail Blazer yelled at me from his car.  He wanted to know about mine.  It's so new that you can't readily identify it yet from the side.  That conversation made the gridlock feel somewhat less terrible.<br/><br/>I also saw, for the first time in my life, a building with a black and yellow sign stating "Fallout Shelter" on it.  The sign was very old, as was the building.  In fact, they were both nearly run down.  I wondered what it must be like inside that shelter now.  Has the water evaporated?  Canned goods gone bad?  Is it still even in there?  My curiosity stopped when I realized that I was actually glad to know where a fallout shelter exists.  At that point I came to my senses, I could need that some day.
