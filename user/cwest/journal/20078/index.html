<p><p class="hft-paras">Today was an excellent day. I have to admit that at, the more I've gone
to conferences, the less interested in sessions I've become. This year
I'm meaning to change that, so today I did.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">In the morning I saw Damian's &quot;Best Practice Perl.&quot; Contrary to Damian's
CPAN persona, he does understand the difference between Good Code and
Clever Code. To a large degree, the talk was a reenforcement of a lot of
my own style. Thankfully, however, I also learned a few new tricks that
I plan on trying out. Since style, and especially effective style, seems
to grow organicly, that's an important point. Try things on before
dismissing them, and dismiss things that don't fit right.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">After lunch I went to &quot;Presentation Aikido,&quot; another of Damian's talks.
Speaking effectively was the subject, and it was demonstrated in clear
detail right from the beginning. Nearly first on his agenda was a bar
fight with Larry, where they beat the crap out of each other. Mind you,
this is Aikido, so they did it very gently and passively, all the while
considering the opponent before themselves.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Dinner was eventful. 13 of us descended upon a poor Chinese place around
the corner. Sadly, they were not the best service in Portland. I
couldn't possibly begin to remember everyone that was there, but I'll
try. Two folks from MSDW, Arthur Bergman, James Duncan, Nicholas Clark,
Robert Spier, Tim Bunce, Jouke Visser, Ricardo Signes, and three other
guys. The food was pretty good, but I thought for sure I was going to
have to fight for my Credit Card back. There's no way I learned enough
Aikido to pull that one off. Thankfully, they finally figured out I
wanted it back.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Again with the wakeup call. tomorrow brings RT and Security hacking, and
the State of the Onion.</p>
