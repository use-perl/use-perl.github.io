<p><p class="hft-paras">My little girl has a few new tricks. She's counting on her own. In the
car she counts &quot;one, two, three&quot; while holding up the appropriate amount
of fingers for each number. She started doing this on her own, without
the need for prompting at each number. She's 21 months, I can't believe
she can do this.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Her other trick is repeating the last phrase of everything she hears. As
a young person, she's characteristically non-discriminatory. If we use
casual expletives, so does she. But she doesn't always get it right.
While she can say (and recently comprehend) the likes of &quot;important&quot; and
&quot;mommy's cooking breakfast,&quot; she has trouble with words like &quot;music&quot; and
&quot;book.&quot; She gets book half the time, but the other half they're known as
&quot;goops.&quot; As for music, I think you can guess from the subject.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">She also has a fascination with lights. I think that's normal, but to
most children want to touch, kiss, hug, and say good night to lights?</p>
