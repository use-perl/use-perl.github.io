<p>The Patriots had their season opener against the midgit football champions of Pittsburgh last night.  The Steelers had their heads handed to them.  I haven't seen football that bad in all my years of watching football, and I watch high school football.<br/><br/>*grumble*

The Steelers had it coming.  With all the trash they've been talking about the Pats leading up to the game, they were asking to get their asses kicked.  And kicked they were.  Go Pats!  (And I'm not even a football fan<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:))

Tell me about it!  The best was when Kordell Stewart said, "sometimes, the best team doesn't win."  No, the best team ALWAYS wins.  We determine the best team by playing games.  Maybe it Pittsburgh realized that last January they were not the best team, they would have been more prepared for last night.  Probably not<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-), but it couldn't have hurt.<br> <br> <a href="http://picks.pudge.net/" title="pudge.net">http://picks.pudge.net/</a pudge.net> <br>

Denver Broncos squatted and dumped on the St Louis Rams.  All the more sweeter because Shannon ("The Mouth") Sharpe used to be part of the Broncos and moved to St Louis.  Ho ho ho.<p>

Well, not that sweet then... Shannon Sharpe moved... back to Denver. And said the result was an upset, as  in "I am upset we didn't scored 40 points on those guys". I love him!<br> <br>Sorry Nat.<br> <br>What do you care about that sport when your Blacks won the 3-series anyway?<br> <br>

OK, I guess I'll have to concede, the Pats won this time<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:--(<br> <br>

Oh that sucks!  I was hoping for a twofer win (beating St Louis AND Sharpe).  But given the Broncos track record, I'll take any win regardless of who played for us<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

The All Blacks rock, 'tis true.  Not hard enough to defeat Australia when it counted (the Aussies retained the hotly contested Bledisloe Cup) but it'll do.</p><p>

Did I mention that the only redeeming feature of Fox is that Fox Sports World carries a lot of NZ rugby?  I'm a happy camper.</p><p>
