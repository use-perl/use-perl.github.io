<p>So I just bought a 2003 Tiburon GT with all the fixings.  Some of those fixings include extra warrenty options: a teflon-like paint coating, some kind of under body cement like substance.. etc.  Those are aftermarket "upgrades" to my car that required me to take it into the dealership tonight.<br/><br/>So into the dealership I go, they promised me a rental car to take home.  I was hoping to get something decent, it should at least have a CD player.  No no, they "hooked me up" as the guy put it, with a Ford Contour with no CD player.<br/><br/>I don't listen to the radio so I ended up listening to KDKA talk radio, a special show about the inner ear of children in the pediatric age range.  This of course caused me to become completley bored with the entire world and made me realise I need to start an FM radio station for the music I like, just for me.  Anyone looking to lose 100,000 USD?<br/><br/>Perhaps it was a good thing, the head lights were almost completley out.  They were so dull that I had to tick off all oncoming traffic by keeping the high beams on.  That was slightly amusing.

I have been looking at something like <a href="http://www.xmradio.com/" title="xmradio.com">XM Radio</a xmradio.com> for $9.99 you aren't forced to deal with the utter crap that is on the airwaves. Hopefully with 100 channels <b>something</b> decent will be playing.

Yeah, like the NASCAR channel, where they broadcast "classic NASCAR races".

I'm just excited that there are 10 rock channels, beats the local airwaves where stations have a playlist of about 10 songs that repeat every hour.

Here I like my <a href="http://www.kcrw.org/" title="kcrw.org">radio station</a kcrw.org> so much that I have not even bothered to install my <a href="http://www.empeg.com/" title="empeg.com">empeg</a empeg.com>. <br> <br>
