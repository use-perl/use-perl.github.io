<p>I would talk about OSCON.  The highlights of the LAN Party or the BOFs, but something else has become my sole highlight.<br/><br/>I will remember OSCON 2002 for one reason only.  I sent chocolates to Richard M. Stallman.  Complete with "love Casey" on the card.<br/><br/>Now that you've had your laugh, I'll explain.  My wife was (for no understandable reason) not allowed in my party by the red coat at the door.  She had a badge and ID, it was odd.  By the time I found out the baby was asleep and it was too late.  I reamed out the bar manager and told him to send my wife some nice deserts.  He said he would take care of it and even told me when it was finished.<br/><br/>The next day I asked my wife if she enjoyed desert and she didn't know what I was talking about.  Since it was free I just let it go.  Until, that is, gnat asked me on Monday: "Did you send chocolates to RMS?"<br/><br/>All in all, I hope he enjoyed them.
