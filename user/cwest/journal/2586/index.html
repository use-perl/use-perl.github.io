<p>It's not a good thing when the alley behind your house becomes a racing strip for loose neighborhood garbage.  I'm getting wind gusts up to 35 mph and fraknly, it scares me.  My house is shaking, phone polls are waving and my wife happens to be on the road right now.<br/><br/>Tonight it's supposed to be 55 mph winds.  Bad news.  I wonder if now is the time to buy some rope and start attaching things to my house.

<h2>Wind</h2>

Wind here was cool last night. I live on the "other" side of a hill, so the wind blows over the hill and seems to pick up speed as it reaches us, making it a fantastic blow down our street. Luckily we don't live in a timber frame house though, which really seems to make a big difference to shakiness in wind. Our last house was timber frame, which seems to be how all "modern" houses are built, but it seems to make the wind movement greater - maybe they can stand more stress than a 100% brick built house.
<br>
<br>Of course I also live on an island, so wind in the US tends to be relative to what we see every day (modulo hurricanes)
