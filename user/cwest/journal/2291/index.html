<p>After all the stuff that happened at the Geek Cruise, I'm on such a buzz to do good work.<br/><br/>I even have a schedule for my day that includes sleeping for a solid amount of time.<br/><br/>Plus, I've been a bit lax with my job before the cruise.  I need to get out of that rut and the Perl Whirl has helped me gain that feeling of working harder for the greater good.  Or something like that.<br/><br/></p>

<p>Yeah, you THINK you'll get back to work, and actually get back into the groove, but you really won't.  No one ever does.  Trust me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>
<p>So, you're a poor bastard like me who has to work on MLK day, huh?  Stupid <a href="http://www.wpi.edu/" title="wpi.edu">WPI</a wpi.edu> has such a compressed class schedule that we staff don't generally get any holidays off, except for when the students aren't in classes.  Ah well, such is life in academia.  At least the benefits rock<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Actually, I don't have to work today.  I'm choosing to as a result of having a week off.  Tickets need to be closed.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<br>
<br>I know, I'm crazy.

Casey... (this is Jeff Bisbee from Perl Whirl)
<p>
I didn't get your e-mail address before we left.  I've signed up with the advocacy list and the beginners lists and even started my perl journal under 'jbisbee'
</p><p>
It's cool to be back at work and I'm working on getting the local Perl Mongers up and running.
</p><p>
If there are any IRC Perl spots or other people that you could introduce me to, that would be cool too.  It was great getting to know you and give our regards to Chastity from Heather and I.
