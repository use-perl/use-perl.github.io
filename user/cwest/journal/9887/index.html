<p>As I was buying lunch for myself and a few friends today, I was waiting in line at the local market and heard some very cool conversation.  Two women, probably on average of 75 were talking about Football.  This is really the first time I've heard this happen.  They were ragging on the Titans and talking about how Bettis will do.  Great stuff.<br/><br/>Of course, I was only slightly amused as I waited for what seemed like days for the lady behind the counter to talk shop with everyone walking by, and take her good old time.  I understand that a small market banks on that and I like it, except when it happens to me.<br/><br/>Well, it's about time for another unscheduled outage.  I'd better make better use of my network time than this.<br/><br/>
