<p>On Friday afternoon I had but one goal, flood the CPAN with ACME::* Modules.  I managed to come up with ACME::Error.  A plugable error interceptor.  When writing this I wrote a standard backend, ACME::Error::SHOUT.<br/><br/><tt>perl -MACME::Error=SHOUT -e'use No::Module::Here'</tt><br/><br/>Then I wrote the backends, HTML, 31337, Translate, IgpayAtinlay, and Coy.  These modules produced Lingua::Atinlay::Igpay and Lingua::31337 as well.<br/><br/>All in all Friday finished up with 11 releases of 8 modules all written that day.  Only later would I realize noone uses ACME::, it's Acme::.  D'oh.<br/><br/>Friday night I went to a very quite dinner at a private little Italian place.  It was as good as on Tuesday.  I must have sat there forever.  After that I met up with Hugo at the hotel lobby and we talked about Perl 6 data types and data classes.  That was a fun talk.  Soon, various factions of london.pm came rolling in, Hugo left, as did a few london.pm folks.<br/><br/>The evening eventually aquired a Traditional Baverian Folk Song guitar player.  He was good.  He admitted to not liking how the traditional songs were played so he played and sang them as the blues and rock 'n roll.  Classic.  James Duncan followed that up with various sing along songs and before I knew it the clock read 4:00am.  Must have been the five 0,33 Liter Cokes I drank.<br/><br/>I went to my room to sleep but ended up watching some cheesey movie with Jim Carey in it.  I was just glad to have english TV.  At this point the day's end blended niceley with the next days beginning.<br/><br/>I got up sometime and made my way to breakfast with a group of london.pm.  Around 12:00 we made the decision to go to the English Garden to get a table at Oktoberfest.  I don't remember much else until dinner when I lead 18 people to my cozy Italian place.  Again the food was great.  We relaxed for some time.  Somehow in this mix I became a london.pm member, now I have to subscribe to the mailing list and visit London, I suppose.  Darn.  :-)<br/><br/>After this some of use decided to go to the hotel lobby for a bit of Fluxx.  This was good fun though playing with seven people at once hinders the fun.  We also realized the game hindered coversationa and it eventually went away.  Out came a pack of O'Reilly branded playing cards and  hearts was played.  We were too tired to play to a high number so we chose 50.  After a number of rounds Greg beat me by one point and Schwern and Fowler went over to end the game.  "It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile, winning is winning."  Again, the clock read 4:00am.<br/><br/>In order to get to the Airport early to take advantage of the cool free wireless network here I needed to wake up at 5:00am.  Too late, I just stayed up.  Packed and fed breakfast I made my way for the train.<br/><br/>So now I'm here, gate B03 waiting three hours for my 12:15 flight.  Yay.  I *really* can't wait to be home.</p>

We're going to have to
<ol>
<li>Have a rematch, once I've got more practiced at playing Hearts and I know the tatics as well as the rules (and I haven't been to a beer festival before)
</li>
<li>Borrow muttley's yard glass (er, two and a half uk pints, ~1.3litres) and try that again (with handy bucket)</li>
</ol>

I'll subscribe to the first of the two however, unless the yard glass is filled with coke I'll never drink from it.<br> <br>I'm clean now.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br>
