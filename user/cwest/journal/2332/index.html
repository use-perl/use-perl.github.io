<p>I usually hate mac & cheese but, my wife makes it really well.  This is the first day since the cruise that I've had lunch.<br/><br/>Oh, about that, I found it very easy to control myself and not eat myself to blowing up.  The food wasn't really that great anyway.<br/><br/>I don't know how they got that 'gain a pound a day' propaganda out there.

<p>Yeah, I didn't really find that the food was all that good that I was eating six million pounds of it, either.  It wasn't <b>bad</b>, it just wasn't really great, either.  Maybe NCL will have better food for Perl Whirl '03<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Yeah.  On the other hand, there was a red wine at the wine and cheese parties that I really liked.  Problem is, with the boat rocking it's hard to hae more than half a glass and not rock with the boat.
