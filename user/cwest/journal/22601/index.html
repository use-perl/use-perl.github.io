<p><p class="hft-paras">Last month Barbie stopped testing CPAN modules.</p>

<p class="hft-paras"><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/barbie/journal/22432" class="hft-urls">http://use.perl.org/user/barbie/journal/22432</a></p>

<p class="hft-paras">This is a problem for me for several reasons. The most important reason
is that he tests on MSWin32. I don't have any Windows computers laying
around and if I did I wouldn't go on developing with them. My opinions
aside, some people do such things.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Barbie works for MessageLabs, a tiny Email Security company with clients
like McDonalds, Moen, and Thiess. They use MSWin32 for some things, and
they use Perl. I'd like to believe that they're at least a little
interested in the Perl Email Project.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">I can't be certain that any of Barbie's testing was related to his work
environment, I don't really care. His testing was very important to me
and uncovered a number of bugs in important Email modules when working
(or failing, as the case may be) under Windows. His FAIL reports were
important.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">So in his closing statements Barbie notes that being a cpan-tester is a
thankless job. I never thanked him. Though I know we discussed failure
reports for my software a couple times. That doesn't count. So Barbie,
thanks for your work. I know that - practically speaking - I really
will miss it.</p>
