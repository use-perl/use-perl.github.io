<p><p class="hft-paras">My family and I will be in Boston this coming weekend for a small family
vacation, while our family is still small. Or are we mid-sized? Whatever
the case we are certainly not flagship material.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Moving on.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">I was wondering if anyone was up for a stroll along the freedom trail
with us. This is of course a very family friendly stroll since we are a
family and we will have strollers with children in them. Non-traditional
families and single participants are welcome to come. You are not
required to pose as a family, nor must you affix cardboard families to
yourself to fit in. All are welcome.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">The date and time of this venture is, roughly speaking, Saturday June
18th at 10:30:00am. I suspect it's easiest to start at the south end,
which also appears to be the beginning according to The Map (
<a href="http://thefreedomtrail.org/freedom_trail_map.pdf" class="hft-urls">http://thefreedomtrail.org/freedom_trail_map.pdf</a> ). Although the map is
nearly impenetrable, there is a nice red brick road we're to follow.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">My calculations suggest that if we walk at roughly 0.833 miles/hour
that's basically 25 yards/minute. That should be a nice casual pace
that everyone can enjoy. This should also take into consideration
moderate site-seeing and very minor tourist shopping and browsing. This
leaves us at the USS Constitution at 13:30:00pm. (Note: This pace is
not required but offered merely as a suggestion. There will be no
enforcement of this pace.)</p>

<p class="hft-paras">If you have any questions or suggestions please send them.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">So please, join us at The Boston Common, otherwise known as number one
(1) on your map. We look forward to meeting you.</p>
