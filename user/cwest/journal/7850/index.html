<p>After lunch (a very good sandwich from a local shop) I managed to sit down and write a large portion of my talk in short time.  Then I went to Jos' POE talk and continued to write slides.  Oh, and there was the lightning talks between the two events.<br/><br/>After this I went to find my new hotel, staying at a cheaper place that's much better.  I fancy that.  After getting a little lost in the rain I finally found my room only to head out yet again for the p5p dinner.  The dinner was in Ratskellar and it was great.  I was there till nearly midnight talking with all sorts of people in a dizzying array of topics.<br/><br/>After this I walked to the Hotel with Hugo and caught a glimpse of his amazing car.  Impressive vehichle.<br/><br/>In my room I went to work cutting down a 45 minute talk to 15 because that's when the lightning talks start in relation to my talk.  I knew everyone would walk out.<br/><br/>In the morning I had a good breakfast at the Hotel with Duncan, Allison, Hugo and a few others.  When I arrived at The Venue I realized that Jos, who was in the same time position as I am got us 30 minutes slots instead of 45.  Great, I thought, I only had 15 minutes of talk.  It was ok though because I managed to make it last about 22 minutes with questions and such.<br/><br/>In any case, I'm in the second set of lightning talks now and they are impressive so far.  I must listen better.<br/><br/>Oh, and Artur Bergman tore me a new one about naming my newest module IO::Language.  Naturally he was right, I knew this when I uploaded it.  :-)  But we have a better name and I'll use it in my next release, today.<br/><br/></p>
