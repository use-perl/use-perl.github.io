<p><p class="hft-paras">Yesterday was tutorial day. I saw Apache 2.0 module development,
and mod_perl 2.0 by example. They were interesting, but hard to
follow without printed materials, which due to a glitch, weren't
printed in time.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">I went to the strip with Nat and Rael for dinner at the MGM Grand
buffet, which wasn't as cheap as folks told us it would be (maybe they
had lunch there). The staff were robotic at dinner, filling our drinks
just as we felt we were about to finish them. This prolonged our stay. I
left with a full glass, and that was annoying.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Next we walked the strip seeing interesting things. We saw two water
shows at the Bellagio, they were stunning. We then went to Venice, or so
it seemed. The Venetian felt it necessary to build an outdoor Venetian
street <strong class="hft-bold">inside</strong> their hotel. A surreal experience, complete with
gondolas and blue skies. Finally we watched the pirate show in front of
Treasure Island. That was less amusing, loud, and with poor singing. Two
of three isn't bad.</p>
