<p><p class="hft-paras">This has been bothering me for months. Long after the event there is
still a particular group of people who refuse to de-sticker their cars.
They cling to hope, as if time stood still, waiting to find out if their
man got the job. What am I talking about? Anyone who drives a long
commute in the US knows what I'm talking about.</p>

<img src="/images/journal/w04.gif" alt="W '04" />

<p class="hft-paras">Folks, I have some disturbing news. <strong class="hft-bold">It is 2005!</strong> Let me try again for
the people in the back.</p>

<p class="hft-paras"><big><strong class="hft-bold">It is 2005!</strong></big></p>

<p class="hft-paras">Months ago most Kerry/Edwards stickers were removed from the windows and
bumpers of commuting losers[*]. They got over it, moved on(.org), and
did what normal people do. So the stickers came off.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">But you, oh redneck Bush supporter[*] in your BMW Sedan, you can't let
it go. You won. You gloat. You refuse to de-sticker your car because it
now means something. It means, to you, that a man identified by a
single letter way in the back of the alphabet was your man. You
supported him and got away with it. So you keep your sticker, you clean
it, you wear it proud. Right next to your &quot;Gun Rights Improve Homeland
Security&quot; sticker.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">This bothers me to no end. There is a deeper problem that I see, but
it's not a problem at all. As I begin to explore this issue I realize
that the <strong class="hft-bold">real</strong> problem is that nobody sporting their &quot;W&quot; bumper sticker
actually thinks about this like I do. That's because it requires words
that are longer than two syllables matched with proper pronunciation.[*]
Not that the Kerry supporters, had they won and kept their stickers,
could do any better. In order to consider this issue out loud you have
to be capable of speaking, and understanding, a complete thought.[*]</p>

<p class="hft-paras">The real problem is that it seems like the Bush supporters only ever had
one goal. To elect Bush. What next? They don't care! Their job is done.
This strikes me as a problem since I have berated hard-line left-facing
friends that their only goal is to elect Kerry. That may be my problem,
but I know I'm not alone in that theory. Everyone knows that Kerry
wasn't a very good candidate.[*] Everyone knows that Bush wasn't a very
good candidate.[*] What I have never heard anyone say is that the Bush
supporters were just voting the party line. You know it's true but
nobody says that. Thankfully for me I didn't sticker my car.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">So, to these lingering sticker-ers I ask, why haven't you moved on?
Don't you want to add a sticker for the next important thing? Perhaps
social security reform (or not), tax reform (or not). How about an &quot;R
'08&quot; sticker since it would seem that you just live for elections and
care little about the aftermath. &quot;Republican for '08&quot; is too long for
those trendy stickers anyway.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Okay, I'm done.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">[*] I'm making gross generalizations, antagonistic comments, and
pandering gestures. It's supposed to be funny. Lighten up (please).</p>
