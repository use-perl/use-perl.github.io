<p>In the grip of war, I've been a lump.  An information hawk to the core, I've finally blocked all the news site I go to from the router, as well as IRC.  I can't take iit anymore.  I'll know stuff when I know stuff.  In the gaps I've been trying to study and learn more Esoteric languages.  They are really freaky.  From malbolge to INTERCAL, BrainF***, 4DL and unlambda.  My head really isn't big enough.  They are all really neat languages, I just wish I understood them, and the math concepts necessary to do it.<br/><br/>I practiced my clarinet again.  I really like to play, I forgot how much music was.  I've been playing drums for the past four years in absence of the clarinet, and I'm not really that good at it.  But I was always good at clarinet, and I'm re-learning stuff.  I need to go get some sheet music for marches and such to get back into things.  I have only a couple songs and a book that teaches the basics and advanced theory stuff, which I'm working through again.  Plus I need some accessories, so I need to find a good inline distributor.  I'm feeling the band geek within well up once more, it's scary.<br/><br/>
