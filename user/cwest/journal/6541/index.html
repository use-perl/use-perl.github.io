<p>Sunday I woke up late and took my time to get ready for the day, with my wife and baby.  Ate a relaxing breakfast.  Toured the hotel with my wife to show her all the interesting points and evetually settled in the "Wireless Lounge" in the registration area.<br/><br/>Gnat caught up with me, along with Peter (an ORA dude) to discuss wireless for the conference.  The biggest outstanding issue was the lounge and Quinn's bar.  We threw out a couple solutions but the one that stuck involved a roof, some windows, dsl equipment and duct tape.<br/><br/>Met with the guys doing hardware and networking for the LAN Party.  It's going to be great.  The layout is good.  Only issue is with the DJ.  We've got a streaming server as the DJ and the sound system in the bar is controlled by a Juke Box.  I may need access to the inside, hoping it has a line in.<br/><br/>Later that night I had a meeting with some folks on the Perl Documentation Project.  It's going to be good.  We hammered out a lot of details that will be presented to the group at the BOF tonight.
