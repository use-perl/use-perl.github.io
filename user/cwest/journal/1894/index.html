<p>The following is a tenative list of my resultions for this year.  Well, the ones that matter to the Perl community.<br/><br/><ul>
<li><b>Conferences</b><br>
    I am going to take every opportunity to be a speaker at the conferences I attend.  This should include GeekCruises, YAPC::EU, YAPC::A::N and TPC 6 at the very least.  I love to teach and write and these are great experiences for me.
<li><b>Books</b><br>
    I will find my niche book idea and secure a contract from a reputable publisher.  Ok, so I am pretty sure I already have a good idea.  Plus, speaking and writing for conferences should help my creative impulses.
<li><b>Beginners</b><br>
    I experienced burn out last year, because of the high volume on the beginners lists and trying to read every single email.  I just can't do that (I don't think any person can).  I'm going to stay consistent by checking the group regularly and providing good assistance and moderation on a regular basis.  But I won't be able to read everything.  Perhaps I'll need to write some software that checks <tt>nntp.perl.org</tt> for possible flame bait and notifies me.
<li><b>Documentation</b><br>
    I will re-submit my (somewhat major) changes to p5p and work to get them approved.  They were suddenly yanked and last year I'm not sure why, especially since there were no good reasons against me (at least none ever came to my inbox).  I will plow through the rest of the documentation as well.
<li><b>The Perl Documetation Project</b><br>
    One man can't do everything.  I will rekindle the flame and get some people to help me out on this.  There is no way I can do it myself (am I repeating?).  This is a valuable resource that needs to be built.
<li><b>Journal</b><br>
    I'm going to spew my opinions and rants out on you like Grant took Richmond. :-)
<li><b>Friendship</b><br>
    I will be taking my wife new baby girl (to be) to as many geek events as they can manage and I'll hope that my family will appreciate all the stuff I do for the Perl community by realizing just how cool it is.  Gaining true friendship, on a personal level, is a truely wonderful and real experience.
