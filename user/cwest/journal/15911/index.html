<p><p class="hft-paras">Wednesday was the Perl/PHP track. I started the morning with
Troubleshooting Apache Configuration, which I saw to add anything
interesting I could to my talk. Next I saw why mod_perl 2.0 sucks, why
mod_perl 2.0 rocks. I finished my viewings with Web Application
Security, PHP based, but quite relevant. I gave my talk in the
afternoon, and it was well received. I feel good about it.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">The evening, as detailed very well by Nat
(<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/gnat/journal/15902" class="hft-urls">http://use.perl.org/user/gnat/journal/15902</a>), was a great success. The PHP
and Perl folks are quite fun to be with, and it was nice to take them
out on behalf of pair Networks.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Now, however, I'm beat. Waking up at 12:30 with a 14:30 departure was
not wise, but I made it with 30 minutes to spare, and I even had to
return the car. I did make one bad move, I never made it to the bose
outlet for Quiet Comfort 2 headphones, and my guess that they'd have a
spot in the airport was way off. I'm stuck listening to the tuned 440
pitch of shameless gamblers tossing their life away 25 cents at a shot,
as well as the rumble of the plane as I make my way back to home,
family, and complete happiness.</p>
