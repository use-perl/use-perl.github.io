<p>I'm currently (im)patiently waiting for an OpenSRS support email, and with it being around lunch time I decided to take some time to learn a new trick.  As you know I've been trying to make decent espresso shots (with varying degrees of success) for a while.  There's only one other person in this office building who is willing to drink my sludge, er, espresso.  So I decided to try and make lattes.  I bought whole milk and five flavors of syrup for taste.<br/><br/>My mom is really into hazelnut creamer so my first try was a latte with hazelnut syrup.  It was very good, to me.  It had a strong coffee flavor and not much syrup, about 15ml to 1.5 oz espresso and 6oz milk.  She didn't like it, coming from a coffee background it was not sweet enough.  I also didn't foam the milk enough, I don't think.<br/><br/>Next I tried an Irish Creme syrup.  This time I went with 1.5 oz espresso, 25ml syrup and 8oz milk.  I ran out of steam before the milk was done, the espresso was also bitter.  This was a disaster.  Fortunately, my wife was willing to try it and she put extra syrup in and enjoyed it, though still noted the bitter flavor of the espresso.<br/><br/>I think I've learned a number of things through this experience, though I felt like a major chain barista what with having to add all those extra ingredients to make it palatable.  Though it goes without saying I might be the only person here who enjoys strong coffee flavor.<br/><br/>I've not yet even had food, so it's off to lunch for me, and perhaps another go at a latte, this time no syrup, just for me.<br/><br/><em>Symphony #3</em> - <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Beethoven%22" target="_blank">Beethoven</a><br/><br/>
