<p>In corrispondance with the author of Date::Tie, a few benchmarks were passed around (by him).  The conclusion is that when compared to DateTime, Date::Tie is considerably faster.  My suspicions were correct when it was discovered that Time::Piece was considerably faster than Date::Tie.
 Even so, way to go Date::Tie for beating DateTime.  I fell victim to the default expectation that anything tied is slow.  While that holds true, tied interfaces aren't always the slowest, so do your benchmarking.<br/><br/>Posted from <a href="http://caseywest.com">caseywest.com</a>, comment <a href="http://caseywest.com/journal/archives/000187.html">here</a>.<br/><br/></p>

<h2>Funny...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2003-07-28T22:23:32</h3>
Funny because Time::Piece 2.00 (not yet out of beta) ISA DateTime.<br> <br>I'm not sure that performance is that critical - it's probably in the thousands of operations per second region. And DateTime buys you so much - a unified base class with support for decimal second values and dates outside the 1970-2038 region.



<h2>Um, but is it correct and/or useful</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2003-07-28T22:41:48</h3>
Does Date::Tie handle leap seconds?  Does it do _anything_ at all useful with time zones?  How flexible is its date math?  Does it handle dates outside the epoch?<br> <br>There are a number of things DateTime does that literally no other Perl date/time module can do.  If you need any of them, then you probably are stuck with DateTime<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br> <br>Note that the author of Date::Tie is also a major contributor the DateTime project as well.
