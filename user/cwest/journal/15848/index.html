<p><p class="hft-paras">Yesterday was java and XML day. Almost nothing of interest to me. One of
the problems is that all the talks are so low-level. One thing I wanted
to know about was setting up JSP, PHP, and CGI on a single apache
process, easily. That's too high-level, even just learning about JSP is
too high-level. I think another problem is that all the sessions are a
single hour. There's not much to discuss in an hour, save low-level
stuff. One of the talks I found interesting was on shoe-horning Apache
onto a small system. It appears that the tricks are the same as
performance tuning for a huge website.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">My mid-evening was spent watching the Pittsburgh Steelers suck. In the
evening I found some interpreted language minded people to hang out
with. It was interesting to note that we were the loudest group at the
hotel's pub. Even after a night of drinking, the Java/ASF members were
still talking about code, it was a sight. I'm glad to have had an
evening conversation that was not completely based on code, if only a
little. My rambunctious cohorts were Dave from Yahoo!, Jamie the LEGO
buff, and later Nat and Rael.</p>
