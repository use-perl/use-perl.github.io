<p>Thanks to Elaine I'm feeling much better today than in past days.  And after a long and hard Christmas day, I'm just plain tired.  I received some great gifts.  This year was tough, I didn't really ask for much but I got everything I wanted.<br/><br/>I got shot glasses and a grinder for my espresso habit (still need a tamper), I got every LEGO set in the new Oriental line, two DVD players and a VCR, clothing, tools, candy...<br/><br/>My baby has an amazing attention span for a ten month old.  When we got a present opened for her, she played with it for a very long time.  We wanted her to move on to another one but she refused.  This caused her present opening to take a good four hours.<br/><br/>After all this my wife and I decided to skip Christmas dinner and just relax.  We watched our new DVDs Shrek, Office Space, and While You Were Sleeping.<br/><br/>I was glad to be finished with the day.  After sleeping in, it's back to real life for me.<br/><br/>
