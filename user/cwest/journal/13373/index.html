<p>This post represents a whole day, at least.  Before the ActiveState party I decided I had enough with v-strings.  I was not alone, so I spoke up.  John Peacock was very excited by the idea, and that put me at ease.<br/><br/>I went to the ActiveState party on Tuesday, but was crowded out and fell downstairs to discuss Ponie more with Artur and James.  That night I wrote Acme::Palindrome and I don't know why, but it is <em>really</em> cool.<br/><br/>In the morning I held down the TPF booth, which was a learning experience.  I discovered just how frustrating exhibit hall behavior is, and I'll not do that anymore.  I will only go to a table I'm truly interested in, unless I <strong>really</strong> can't resist the fodder.<br/><br/>Wednesday was marked by a historic event.  Autrijus outlined 1% of his favorite CPAN as a Chinese Rap.  I was floored.  Shortly after, we all sang Allison's Restaurant together, lead by Allison.<br/><br/>I gave my talk Wednesday afternoon in a small but packed room.  There were people out the door, standing room only.  I was pleased.  My slides had some bugs because of the computer crashing and backup retrieval I had to do this week.  But the talk flowed, and the finale went really well.<br/><br/>After dinner with Fotango, Best Practical, and Develooper I made my way to the (Perl|Parrot|Ponie) [56] (Porters|Hackers) party and was not disappointed.  I had many good conversations and a very relaxing time.  Some favorites were: Geneva's story of giving a speech that made someone faint and twitch, how to teach babies what "girl parts" (heinesses won) are called with Jenine, interior design with Nat and Tanya, tt3 with Wardley, v-strings (more) with Artur et al, community theory with James (where we both decided "the world is great, no worries"), and others.<br/><br/>By the time I got back to my room last night, v-strings were deprecated in 5.8.1!<br/><br/>Posted from <a href="http://caseywest.com">caseywest.com</a>, comment <a href="http://caseywest.com/journal/archives/000166.html">here</a>.</p>
