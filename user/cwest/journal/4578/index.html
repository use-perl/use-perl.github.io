<p>So I'm trying to rid my body of this toxin.  I've cut back from 8 to 2 sodas a day, on average.  I notice if I don't eat and drink (water) enough, I get a really bad downer, and the headache is noticably annoying.<br/><br/>This is all a good thing though, accompanied by a 2 mile walk at 5am.  Overall I'm beginning to feel a bit better.  The only piece of the puzzle that isn't filled in is sleep.  I need to get to sleep by 9pm or 9:30pm and that is very difficult.<br/><br/>Right now I'm in one of those downers.  I hope to break out of this new cycle and just feel energized and focused all day.  Must go drink more water.

<h2>Heh, me too</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/2shortplanks/">2shortplanks</a> on 2002-05-01T20:35:55</h3>
Crashed totally on Sunday.  So I decided that it was time to cut out the caffine.
<p>
Now I'm a pint of tea in the morning kinda guy (this is not an exageration - I do actually have a pint mug.)  I haven't drunk any caffine since Sunday.  Slept 13 hours on Monday night.  9 hours last night.
</p><p>
Of course, you <em>do</em> get caffine hangovers.  New Scientist did a special edition about two years ago where they explained all about it.  Got the headache and feeling physically sick
</p><p>
So I've switched to warm squash drink.  Let's see how long I last cold turkey.
</p><p>
Good luck!</p>



<h2>Caffiene</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dws/">dws</a> on 2002-05-02T04:54:35</h3>
I took advantage of a bad case of the flu to kick caffiene. The headaches were bad, but the aches and chills (and puking) where a lot worse.<br>



<h2>Geek support groups</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-05-02T17:43:48</h3>
<p>Are there any support groups for geeks about this kind of thing?  I'd like to kick the habit, too.</p>

<p>My standard practice is to limit myself to one 12 oz. can every four hours.  That seems like a lot to me but lately I've been hearing that to some people, that's not much.</p>

<p>My main problem is when school is in full swing, I have to stay up.</p>
