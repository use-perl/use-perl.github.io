<p><p class="hft-paras">Tuesday was the &quot;Others&quot; day here at ApacheCon. The talks were quite
varied, as opposed to Monday. Among &quot;other&quot; things, Brian Aker convinced
me that MySQL clustering and replication isn't that hard, and works.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">In the afternoon I, like Chris (<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/shiflett/journal" class="hft-urls">http://use.perl.org/user/shiflett/journal</a>)
attempted to see a Perl vs. PHP vs. Java show down featuring Nat and
Rasmus, and some Java dude. We were shot down, and came to learn that
the talk was part of a different conference entirely. We went to the
registration desk and asked what the price of 30 minutes of the
conference was, but he didn't have a sense of humor about that. I'm
pretty sure it would have come to more than 10 dollars, out of my
price range.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">My moment of Zen came on the bus ride back. I learned about embedded
technologies by implanting a TV in my head. Or trying to. One of three
TV's protruding from the ceiling of the bus broke me open. That was
not pleasant.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">The rest of my evening was spent answering email and passively
hacking code.</p>
