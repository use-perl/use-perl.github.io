<p><p class="hft-paras">On Wednesday I'll have been working at pair Networks for six months.
Wow, that went by really quickly. Perhaps it is true, &quot;time flies when
you're having fun.&quot; At the end of six months at pair you have a review.
Basically, your probationary period is over and they decide if you are
fit for pair. When I found this out I decided to give them a six month
probationary period as well. I'm doing my review first.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">On the average, pair gets an A as an employer. The work environment is
relaxed, but structured. At the end of a work day I don't feel guilty
putting down the computer and leaving work at work. The other Software
Developers have a lot to teach me about running such a huge operation.
I've worked in some high-availability places but none of them have been
so resource intensive and user sensitive as the business of web hosting
on this level. In short, I'm doing fun projects and working with
cluefull people, and I'm relaxed. Can't ask for much more.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">As for the job I've been doing. I'm biased, but I think I'm working out
for pair. :-)</p>
