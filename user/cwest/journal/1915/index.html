<p>My Picturebook, the C1VN, does not come with a network card.  So I bought a Lynksys PCMCIA card for it.  Now this card claimed cross platform compatability to a fault.  I was supprised to find this at CompUSA so I bought it.<br/><br/>For the most part, they're exactly right.  The one part that they missed out was when attempting to install RedHat over the network, on a Sony Picturebook.  See, the Picturebook has no extra drives built in so, I have a USB floppy from which to boot.  Fine, and there is a driver disk for pcmcia devices that I can use too.<br/><br/>The problem lies in the fact that the BIOS pretends that the USB floppy is an IDE floppy when you boot the computer.  But then it forgets this falacy during operation, leaving me with no driver disk usage.<br/><br/>Now what?  I'm downloading two ISO images from some mirror in Germany onto a friends computer since I don't own a CD Burner.<br/><br/>The only think I take comfort in is that installing Windows 2000 on it wasn't a walk in the park either.  But it did use less bandwidth.</p>

On my vaio sr1k I had to pass ide1=0x180,0x386 to the kernel on startup. Not sure why, but it would lose the CD rom during install if I didn't.
