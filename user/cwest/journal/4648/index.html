<p>I have a family reunion to attend tomorrow.  The only link I have to this family is my mother and she won't even be there.  Thankfully, I don't be staying with relatives to make their life miserable, what with a screaming baby at midnight.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the majority of this family is sane.  I don't think we have any criminals and most everyone has jobs and legitimate children.  All the old folks are retired Air Force or married to one, or widow of one.<br/><br/>All the folks in grandma and grandpa age are cool, except my grandmother.  All the other grandmas and grandpas tell stories about her, from years gone by.  Since the baby was born my grandmother has seemed quite normal though.  Interesting, that.<br/><br/>All the middle aged people are either in mid-life crisis mode or, the majority, are layers, accountants, doctors; anyone who can be too good for me.  At the last reunion I had an uncle of some kind lecture me on the woes of not getting a bachelors degree, he said "You'll never get into management without moving past a two year degree, you'll be stuck going nowhere."  I'd like to feel that at least my meaningless job titles more than make that statement false.  It should be interesting to see his reaction to how I "turned out."<br/><br/>Everyone in my age group is cool.  We're all funny and witty, and we all have something to talk about that's interesting.  It would seem that we have had enough interesting experiences with extended family to make the 10 hour party bearable with story telling.<br/><br/>And the young kids, spoiled or... spoiled.  I usually just ignore them and they're quite fine with that because they weren't going to share with me anyway.<br/><br/>Now it comes to my family.  I have the new baby on the block, and my wife is still a mystery to many.  The ones that know her, love her.  That should be both good and bad during this trip.  Chastity and I are quite protective of your bundle of joy so I think we may have a rough time with the baby passing at the reunion.  Things like, "How do we know she washed her hands after she wen't to the bathroom, now she's putting her finger in the baby's mouth!" tend to bother us.<br/><br/>Now it's time for packing up baby clothes, daipers, furniture, blankets, washing basins.  Traveling with baby is an adventure in cargo capacity.  Not to mention I need a hair cut, my car needs washed, my lawn needs cut and my wife is sick as a dog in a rain storm.<br/><br/>:-)</p>

<h2>Management</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-05-03T22:11:59</h3>
<p>I <i>have</i> a bachelor's degree, and I have no intention of moving into management any time soon, if ever.  Not all careers are "successful" careers, but success does not have to include being a doctor, lawyer, or manager.  In fact, most non-programmers I know instantly recognize my career as a "success."</p>

<p>Do you want to move into management some day?  If not, don't let it bother you.</p>

<p>All the same, that bachelor's degree can open doors.  And I'm not talking management doors.</p>
