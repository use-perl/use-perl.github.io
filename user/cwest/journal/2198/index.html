<p>Today I didn't make it off the boat.  I woke up late, I spent the morning checking email and talking with a few folks and going on to have lunch with them.<br/><br/>One of those folks was Damian, and I was fortunate enough to get speaking tips from him.  I also got great criticism from him as he was in my talk.  It was really cool to hear what I got wrong, and excellent to hear that I did things well.  :-)<br/><br/>The afternoon was spent working on the TT CookBook chapters.<br/><br/>Then I got re-dressed and we took the group photo at the forward observation deck where I was able to amaze a few (by accident) by jumping up and touching the rim of the basketball hoop.  And hanging horizonatly from the hoop.<br/><br/>We're in speaker Q&A now.
