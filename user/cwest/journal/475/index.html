<p>Well, it's 10am my time.  I was up till 2am my time last night trying to get a LAN between my windows laptop and my linux laptop.  The windows laptop has the working modem, on a dual eth/modem Xircom card.  So, connect to the internet via the modem, set up LAN on the eth part right?  Wrong.  My best estimate is that 1) You can't use both parts of the Xircom card at once and 2) Windows expects to hear special things from the other side of the x-over cable, ie. things windows would say to each other.<br/><br/>In any case, I failed and will try to make the modem work on the windows box with my linux partition on the same box!  Then I can nat and ipchain my way to internet freedom, as soon as I figure out how.  :-)<br/><br/>I'm off to play the drums and get the giddyness and anxiousness out of me.  I'm sure it won't work but at least I'll feel better for a while.  My brother is taking me to the airport in an hour.  I'm glad to get time with my brother but sad that my wife can't take me.  She is camping with an all girls group that my church created, kind of like the Girl Scouts.<br/><br/>I'll see some of you at TPC.  I'll be the short kid in a red, fitted Structure hat.  Or, if you recognize by technology, I'll be carrying around a sony picturebook and a blue back pack.<br/><br/>Enjoy!</p>
