<p>My mom got a <a href="http://bfcnetwork.org/westbaby">Online Picture Gallery</a> up before I did.  Here I am, a "Computer Professional" and I can't cope with Grandma.<br/><br/>
All in all I'm glad she did, I can take my time.  :-)<br/><br/>The baby was smiling today, and not because she had gas.  We tried to get some pictures of her in all her wonderment.  She really is a good baby.<br/><br/>Also, she was really hungry today while mom was taking care of her own personal hygene and I didn't know what to do.  So I thought, I don't have milk filled breasts but I could fake her out.  I put my pinky in her mouth and that was a very cool experience.  To all you dads out there with nursing babies, try this, it feels really funny and it will give you an understanding of why mom has trouble with the pain.  Those babies are strong.<br/><br/></p>

Congrats yet again Casey, everyone is right that you really do have a very cute baby!  Now you just have to earn your geekdom back by getting your gallery up<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  I have a funny feeling that you have some other things on your mind ahead of that, though, and with good reason.  Congrats!

In order to get his "geekdom" back, he needs to fo better than his Grandma<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... maybe by writing his own image gallery software.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)  Or, at least hosting it himself.

I just hope he has that RedHat install on geeknest.com patched so he doesn't get 0wned again...
