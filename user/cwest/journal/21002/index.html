<div class="span8">
<p><p class="hft-paras">Last weekend I had the pleasure of attending Foo Camp at O'Reilly's
California campus. It was an exciting trip. I met a lot of people I
already knew, and many more that I didn't.</p>

<p class="hft-paras"><strong class="hft-bold">Foo Details</strong></p>

<p class="hft-paras">I'm going to try to recall important facts and figures (people) the best
I can. There were two sessions I ran at Foo. The first was &quot;Web Services
War Stories.&quot; I had folks from Google, eBay, PayPal, del.icio.us, and
Amazon at my disposal and I was curious about how they felt about web
services. Generally, the session ran like an AA meeting for people
having to deal with SOAP.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">By-and-large, everyone agreed that while SOAP is a huge pain to deal
with, it's a necessary evil if you have any kind of corporate interest.
There also appear to be hard issues in the areas of security,
authentication being at the top of the list. Finally, much to my dismay,
.NET and Java are important considerations if you have business-level
interest in your web services.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Meng Wong and I tried to run a session on designing the next generation
email system. That didn't work so well. We had some disruptive students
in the class and, unlike I knew I should have, I didn't feel like
settling them down. Due to this I don't have anything interesting to
report here.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">On the way back to the airport I gave Meng and James Duncan a ride into
San Francisco. We stopped for a wonderful dinner and some relaxing
conversation. It was the highlight of the trip, to sit and relax, and
converse with interesting folks. Now that I think of it, that was the
large part of Foo Camp.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">After Dinner I left these folks and got on a plane for Pittsburgh.</p>

<p class="hft-paras"><strong class="hft-bold">Rest Time</strong></p>

<p class="hft-paras">Now here comes the interesting part. I was in the process of securing
plane tickets to head off to YAPC-EU in Belfast, which I expected would
come through for a flight on Tuesday. It was Monday at this point. When
I finally got home I got the details of my flight. I was leaving in
three hours.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">So, after an extended layover in Pittsburgh I made my way to the
airport to catch a flight to London. Oddly, as I'm waiting to board the
plane Mr Duncan comes walking down the hall. You just can't get rid of
some people. I had left him in SFO, he had a later flight out of there,
and we were once again together and flying to London. Neither of us
expected that. :-)</p>

<p class="hft-paras"><strong class="hft-bold">YAPC-EU</strong></p>

<p class="hft-paras">In Belfast it was known that I was coming without much expendable
income. Marty and Karen gave me a room in their lovely house, and an air
mattress, so I had shelter. The many kind YAPC attendees helped me
through the week with food and drink, sometimes too much of either. But
it turned out just fine.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">I didn't go to any talks, except for the ones I was either giving or
organizing. I accepted my fate of assimilation into the organizational
staff. I helped get the wireless network running, I carried things, and
I organized a couple of &quot;free form&quot; sessions titled &quot;Essential CPAN
Modules&quot; and &quot;Life Hacks.&quot;</p>

<p class="hft-paras">An interesting bit on the Life Hacks was that I tried to organize a live
webcast of James Duncan talking about some utilities he'd written to
make his life easier. This almost worked. Every solution we tried
required too much bandwidth because, well, the folks in the audience
were likely upgrading their Debian installs while listening. We resolved
to an audio cast and me controlling an editor. It worked well enough,
but we'll go for something better at a later time. I've got some ideas.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Saturday was a very fun day. Marty, Tony, Karen and I toured the north
east coast of Ireland. It's amazingly beautiful. We could see Scotland
across the Irish Sea, which means the weather was in our favor. At one
point we were rained on pretty good, but that just created more beauty,
a double rainbow over the sea.</p>

<p class="hft-paras"><strong class="hft-bold">Back Home</strong></p>

<p class="hft-paras">So now I'm back home. In three weeks I'm off to Venice to board the Geek
Cruise, a trio of Perl, MySQL, and Linux. I'm looking forward to that
trip as well.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Maybe I'll even get back into the habit of writing in this Journal.
Speaking of random details, how do you like the autumn colors?</p>
