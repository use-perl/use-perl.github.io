<p>I have found just the right kit for me.  Now all I need to do is enough side work to collect 4k and buy it.<br/><br/>The <a href="http://www.rolandus.com/PRODUCTS/MI/mi_namm_w01/vconcert_b.htm">Roland V-Concert</a> Drum Set.<br/><br/>This set looks great and, it's portable enough to make it to TPC for the Jam BOF.  Now.. who's looking for a quick coder for a few hours?  ;-)</p>

<h2>Loads of fun.</h2>

I've played the Vdrum set and it's really nice. A friend has the older Roland set (TD7?) which works damn well too.<p>
But if it's portable you're looking for, well then, you want a <a href="http://www.zendrum.com/" title="zendrum.com">ZenDrum</a zendrum.com>.</p><p>

That same friend with the older Roland kit (Which he has mixed into his acoustic Tama concert series) has a ZenDrum. Connected via MIDI to the brain of his TD7 as it's sound source, it's truly astonishing how easy it is for him to lay down real SOLID grooves. It took him about a week to get the feel of it, but he's now just as good with the Zendrum as he is with the regular kit.</p><p>

And, at $1450 for the unit, plus $150-175 ish for a head unit like the Alesis D4, you've got a much more portable kit that you can actually prowl the stage with, for a LOT less money.</p><p>

Oh, and for the record, while I could probably hold my own behind a 4/4 punk band, I'm a bassist by trade<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I have a Roland TD 10 right now, but I gave it to my Church and now need a set for home use.  It really rocks but I can't find anyone who is selling them, or I'd buy another one.  I also happened to get mine for 1500 USD with 2 carrying bags.
<br>
<br>That ZenDrum looks really nice, btw.

Make that a TD-7, just as I said.
