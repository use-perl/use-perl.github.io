<p>Are you ready for this?  How many companies, working with a community helper (liason/coordinator/visionary(for this)) can pull this off?<br/><br/><ul>
  <li>Tim mentions he'd "like to make a sizeable donation to the Perl Foundation" over dinner.
  <li>I jokingly reply "about 20 or so *cough*thousand*cough* bucks would be good."
  <li>Into my brain is dumped the vision for the perfect event, win win win for everyone.
  <li>Tim accepts the idea and asks me to coordinate.
  <li>Tim makes sure his team is behind it.
  <li>I run across the boat looking for Damian and ask him to make his way to the library.
  <li>Run back and discuss plan with Tim.
  <li>Damian arrives.  We tell him the plan and he is extatic.  He gives us some suggestions: Larry should recieve check, Neil should make announcement.  Damian commits to talking with Larry.
  <li>Tim gets his marketing friend working.  Entire DynDNS team begins hammering out Preliminary Press Release.
  <li>I contact Perl Foundation and ask them prepare [uber z3Kr37 stuff here].
  <li>I run all over boat looking for Neil.  He's baby sitting, ask to have him meet us in library when finished.
  <li>Tim and I try to find printing companies (such as Kinko's) in Nassua, there is nothing.
  <li>We discuss physical arrangments of persons during presentation and plan for the wine and cheese party the next night.
  <li>Neil arrives and "steps into our office."  I explain our plans and Neil is excited and accepts announcement role.
  <li>Sleeping.
  <li>Wake up and get response from gnat, reply and make sure to say Happy Birthday.
  <li>Continue hashing out detail.  Plan what we'll do to get big check while at bahamas.
  <li>Breakfast.
  <li>Get unhappy commitment from ship photographer to photograph event.
  <li>Listen to Dominus on "Tricks of the Wizards."
  <li>Get Damian and make sure he talks to Larry.
  <li>Get fake check from Internet.
  <li>Use Gimp to strip it bear, add parts we need, blow it up to 17x11 inches and 300 dpi.
  <li>Transfer image to Tims laptop.
  <li>Set foot on Bahamas.  Get epiphany that hotels have business offices.
  <li>Ask tourist office where best hotel on island is.
  <li>Set out for Hilton.
  <li>Wait for Hilton business office to open.
  <li>I realise the sick and twisted way in which we can get a large check and set out.
  <li>Tim prints to 8.5x11 inch paper.
  <li>Hotel lady does copier magic to get check sized right.
  <li>Cut check out.
  <li>Cut backing from fedex box found in corner, with leatherman from random hotel worker.
  <li>Scotch tape paper and cardboard together.
  <li>Three copies made (backups, of course).
  <li>Get back to ship and shower.
  <li>Get real commitment from photographer by letting him know we'd by lots of pictures.
  <li>Tim signs checks with dry erase marker, after quite a bit of practice.
  <li>Wine and Cheese party begins.
  <li>Damian confirms that Larry will accept check on behalf of the Perl Foundation.
  <li>Photographer arrives, I let Neil know he should start.
  <li>Neil makes excelent speech.  Tim makes excelent speech.
  <li>Check is presented, pictures taken.
  <li>Neil and I get picture with check presentation.
  <li>Larry and Damian fill in quotes on the DynDNS Press Release minutes before release.
  <li>Press Release Released.
  <li>I make announcments on IRC, use.perl.org and the advocacy list.
  <li>We celebrate and have dinner.
</ul><br/><br/>If I may say so, not bad for a bunch of geeks in the middle of the ocean.<br/><br/>Moral of the story: Eat healthy and you can do anything.  ;-)</p>
