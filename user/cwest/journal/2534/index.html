<p>I've got a linux box dialing to my ISP.  It's running dhcp and nat and ip_tables to get my other computers online.  This was fun and cool.  Only took 5-6 hours to figure it all out.  Now, if I had a wireless access point I'd really be in business.  And when Satelite comes in, the uplink will happen of the dial up connection and all this was worth it after all.  :-)<br/><br/>I decided to turn off my lava lamp and try to let the tiny bits settle.  They're floating aimlessly right now but I figure that by Saturday, when it's 20 outside and 35 in my office, it will all work out for the good.

<p>Now you should set up a web server on your gateway box, so you can have all kinds of people from the outside sucking away your precious modem bandwidth.  And you can use <a href="http://www.dyndns.org/" title="dyndns.org">dyndns.org</a dyndns.org> to get past your presumably dynamic dialup IP!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
<p>&lt;/plug&gt;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Or, since I work for the ISP I could just set myself up with a static IP.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
<br>
<br>OTOH, why wouldn't I want to contribute to dyndns, they've (indirectly) contributed to me.
<br>
<br>OTOH, when I get satellite I'll surely have an uncontrolable dynamic IP and dyndns could help.. could I get VPN stuff working with the help of dyndns?

<p>Ahh, didn't realize you were dialling up to the ISP that you work for, I suppose that changes things<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
<p>Getting VPN stuff working depends a lot on your VPN.  The small amounts of VPN stuff I've worked with relies on having the actual IP addresses; I imagine that there's something out there that will work out with hostnames, though, in which case dyn would be able to hook you up.  We just map hostnames to IP addresses, after all, we don't filter all of your traffic.  I can't imagine the bandwidth that'd use - we use enough for DNS traffic alone!</p>

It probably depends upon the VPN whether you need dyndns at all.
<br>
<br>The VPN software I use for my work has my laptop connect to the server at work - the server just replies to the calling address, so it doesn't matter whether the laptop has a fixed IP address or not.  I have to enter a code from a secureID card to convince it that it is me rather than some imposter pretending to be me, so it doesn't need to also insist in a fixed IP address.  I've used it over dial-up PPP on the road as well as from inside my home network (which actually <b>does</b> use dyndns - I've been very pleased with them).
