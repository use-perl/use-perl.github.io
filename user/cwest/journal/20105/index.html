<div class="span8">
<p><p class="hft-paras">Today was an eventful day. If all the rest are easier, I'll be happy.
The morning was marked by a great talk by Jesse and Robert on RT. We got
an overview of the structure and implementation of RT, and some useful
examples of hacking it to do our bidding.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Lunch was the most important part of my day, it was with my editor. I've
been behind, and communication has been poor between us, but
nevertheless I've been working my butt off. I was still nervous, as I
always am about these things. It was a good meeting though, we had a lot
to talk about and I think we're all happy. David turned out to be a very
nice guy. His co-hort, Betsy (I believe, I hope I'm not getting that
wrong) was also wonderful. Progress was made and I kept my lunch down.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">The afternoon began with a hacking and intrusion detection talk. It was
interesting but I felt I had no real application. At pair the staff has
been trained to notice social engineering, and when we develop we're
always way too paranoid about security. This probably puts us at the
right mind set to get some of it right.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Half way through the talk I decided to move on. I went to the speakers
lounge to work on my talk and the most bizarre thing happened there. ESR
had arrived (no big deal there) and without a visible weapon. That's not
strange. What's strange is that when I corrected him on his answer to
&quot;Is Larry on at 7pm?&quot; he lied in retort. He claimed that Larry did start
at 7pm, but the schedule had the OS Awards then (him!). I pointed out
that the OS Awards were being presented then and he said, I quote, &quot;I'm
MCing that and I can authoritatively tell you that no awards will be
given tonight.&quot; More on that later.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">I didn't have time for a proper meal, so I went down to the UG Leaders
BOF put on by Marsee Henon. I have to tell you, she's amazingly
effective. I really admire her ability to interface with UGs on behalf
of O'Reilly without making everything a sales pitch. The only
disappointment: the cool shirt was XL! Folks, please, not everyone is
XL. The shirt is now unusable to me and my puny M frame. Seriously, it
    won't shrink enough. Use L and have a few XL for exceptions.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Next, and right away, was the DBI Driver BOF. This was good
information on DBI v2.x, noting changes and fixes. The long and short
is that Tim has gone to wonderful lengths to ease the burden on driver
developers, which means your drivers should stay safe. This means your
applications shouldn't care, at least not too much, about which DBI
version you're using.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Now, on to the OS Awards. Remember the Eric episode? What's so ironic is
that he <strong class="hft-bold">did</strong> get up and present awards, one to <strong class="hft-bold">Larry!</strong> Not only was
Larry first, but ESR also gave awards! Shock, dismay, roast beef! Where
was I... oh yes, Onions go nicely with roast beef. Larry was next up
with his State of the Onion speech where, by and large, he spoke about
nothing at all useful. He drove a single point home at the end, and was
effective in getting there: Thanks. That's what he had to say. I liked
that. Paul Graham explained us to ourselves afterward. Explaining the
problems hackers face fitting in to normal society. That was my take.
While I don't claim to be an extraordinary hacker I did relate to many
of this points on work and environment. Sometimes I related so strongly
I was nodding my head out loud. Well that's what it feels like when
you're doing those things in a large crowd and you realize it. Perl's
White Camel awards were given by David Adler to deserving recipients.
Some couldn't make it so Ann Barcomb presented pictures on a laptop for
audience reference. It was amusing. Finally, Damian gave &quot;Live, the
Universe, and Everything.&quot; A very entertaining talk on ... everything.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">By the end of the night I felt proud of one thing. I've aligned myself
with a community of people which, and this always feels like the odd
part, all like a programming language. The last part seems irrelevant,
because all the people are really wonderful. Perl shined last night,
proving why we're the wonderful. <strong class="hft-bold">We</strong>, as in the people.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Nothing interesting happened the rest of the night. I tried to eat a 1
pound burger from the sports bar and when I met Masque he redirected me
to some stranger because I didn't know what he looked like. I asked for
Masque and Masque himself said &quot;oh, that's him,&quot; and I believed him. It
was late, I'm allowed to act the fool.</p>
