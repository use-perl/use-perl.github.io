<p>We gave chase, but lost by a narrow margin.  In the effort, I witnessed a four hour sunset and a magnificant lighting storm.  To the Artist of nature, thank you.<br/><br/>The travel was generally not terrible.  There were some notables.  On my quick hop to the Delta hub I was in a plane that was clearly designed by a sardine.  To boot, I was seated next to the embodyment of post-teenage angst woman (I called her angst for short, in my head).  Angst was further annoyed when the flight attendant had the nerve to tell her to turn off her cell phone in flight.  But most importantly, angst was huge, and I dare not challenge any post-teenage angst woman who is huge.<br/><br/>The main flight right into Portland was nice.  They showed an in-flight movie titled "Bend it like Beckham."  Where an Indian girl breaks all her parents rules to go play football (soccer, for you Americans).  At first I felt uncomfortable about watching this movie.  I felt it iwas a poor choice for Delta, as it could offent a great deal of people.  This feeling was subdued when they announced there would be a VIEWING CHARGE.  Soon after, the feeling was non-existent when I saw a family of four sneak out the headphones they clearly stole from a previous flight to use without paying!<br/><br/>But all in all, it was a great trip.  Allison and chromatic picked me up from the airport.  There I also stumbled into Schwern and hydo with a sign reading 'PANTS || ENOPANTS', which was clearly for DrBacchus.<br/><br/>I'm now awake at a terribly early hour having slept on one of the more comfy couches I've ever slept on.  That's another thing.  My body seems to be adjusting to waking up early by itself, since I signed with pair.  This is annoying, because I was still hoping for a few more days of prying myself out of bed at the last minute.  Maybe I can take this opportunity to make breakfast for the house.  I make a mean pancakes, just ask my wife.<br/><br/>Later today I'll be found at the PerlHackAthon in the OSCON hotel lobby.  I'm the guy with the annoyingly small laptop with no battery power.<br/><br/>
