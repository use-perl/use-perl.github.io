<p>I've been gone a while.  My life has been changing itself.  I've got a new job, a new phone, a new laptop with a new OS.  My baby can crawl, she just learned to flip from back to front which means she's completley mobile.<br/><br/>I'm going to YAPC::EU to talk about Net::DNS.<br/><br/>I wrote a module yesterday called Sys::Headers that will probably force me to rewrite h2ph to work correctly.<br/><br/>Lots of changes.<br/><br/>I've got creative block at the moment.  Not good for my situation.  I'm not sure how to attack this so I'm going to do it head on.  I'll probably produce lots of stuff to throw away later but it will be lots of stuff none-the-less.<br/><br/>I'm on vacation from DynDNS right now, but that's to work on other things.<br/><br/>I went to the first Pittsburgh Perl Mongers meeting in a while.  I'm the "president" of the group now.  I need to start planning for next month.  Anyone want to come to Pittsburgh and talk mid-September, for free, taking care of yourself?  :-)<br/><br/>I'll be around more now, life has settled a bit.

Casey is far too modest: he was not only voted president, but it was unanimous!

Is mid September isn't it (I'm in Munic 17th-&gt;22nd inclusive.)  Does that mean you're be missing the next meeting yourself?<br> <br>Anyway, see you at YAPC....

Actually, I'll probably try and schedule for either the 12th or 16th.  If the 16th, I'll try and hop a redeye from Pittsburgh right after the meeting.  Must confirm plans.  Thanks!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
