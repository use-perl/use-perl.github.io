<p>Date: Wed, 30 Jul 2003 20:24:37 -0400<br /> Message-ID: &lt;20030731002437.GV99792@geeknest.com&gt;<br /> From: Casey West &lt;casey@geeknest.com&gt;<br /> To: "Ricky St. John" &lt;rstjohn@igainc.com&gt;<br /> Subject: Serious Issue with Local IGA Manager<br /><br/><br/>A woman named Janet claims to be a manager at the local IGA grocery store. The store is in Vandergrift PA, zip code 15690.<br/><br/>Janets attention was required by the cashier to perform a managerial function on the cash register. This urgent request was repeatedly denied by Janet.<br/><br/>When Janet decided to provide assistance to the cashier it was hardly undivided. Janet spent most of the 20 minutes that I wasted waiting on what was very clearly a personal phone call. During several brief moments when she was not occupied by her phone conversation, a customer manned the phone in her absence.<br/><br/>The assistance Janet provided the cashier was below substandard. Janet was belittling and rude, making the cashier look foolish in front of other customers.<br/><br/>As you can see, Janet has committed several atrocities against customers, fellow workers, and the IGA corporation. All of this witnessed by me in just 20 minutes time. How does she spend the rest of her day at the company's expense? The job market is overflowing with potential supermarket shift managers, Janet should not abuse the privilege of good paying work.<br/><br/>My recommendation is firm: take immediate action to discipline Janet, up to and including termination of her employment. You know public relations principals, if I am willing to go as far as contact you regarding this matter there are no doubt countless others with the same feelings.<br/><br/>Sadly, I will not subject myself to this treatment again. Neither will I cause a cashier unjust public embarrassment at the hands of Janet, the sub-par manager.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.<br/><br/>--    Casey West <br/><br/>Posted from <a href="http://caseywest.com">caseywest.com</a>, comment <a href="http://caseywest.com/journal/archives/000214.html">here</a>.</p>
