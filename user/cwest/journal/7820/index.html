<p>Last night was the speakers dinner, a rather large faction of us arrived together.  It was a very good time.  The food was good too.  I've never had a pig product that was so juicy.  I didn't stay for the dessert as it was already 22:00 by that time.  I needed to get rest because I was switching hotels in the evening and my talk was first thing in the morning (what a cruel trick :).<br/><br/>I'm glad I did that, I woke up and packed and headed for the train just on time.  I reviewed my Template Toolkit talk and was prepared.  When I started the talk I got tripped up a bit by myself.  I was worried that I might use too many American sayings, or speak too quickly.  I don't know that I recovered well from that, if I said something I was worried everyone might not understand I started to stumble.  Other than that it was a good talk.  The audience was receptive and interested.<br/><br/>And the thing I like most, people followed me to the hall to ask questions.<br/><br/>Now it's time for the coffee break as I haven't had breakfast yet (not a good thing to do before you talk, BTW).
