<p>I've been working mostly on trouble tickets with the job I'm at now.  I don't like this.  I don't get to move on and do better things.  Because of this, I'm focusing my energy on killing tickets so I can move on.<br/><br/>This means some changes.  For the next little while I'll have to IRC much less, and read journals less often.  I think this will be good for me.<br/><br/>So my question is, how do you maintain productivity?

<tt>I have the least trouble maintaining productivity when I'm<br>interested in my task. For me, that generally means that I'm<br>either solving an interesting problem, or I'm interacting with<br>someone.<br> <br>If I've got some less interesting task, I'll find my mind is<br>more eager to wander and I'll be working slower.<br> <br>To get around this, I'll try to make my task more interesting.<br>Since problem solving is interesting for me, I might take some<br>specific less-interesting problem, and try to develop a more<br>general solution to a class of problems. Sometimes this is as<br>simple as "document and publish the solution rather than just<br>emailing it to one user". That may not be any more 'fun' than<br>emailing a solution to a user, but it holds my interest a bit<br>more because I have to write things for a wider audience and<br>be more precise in my language.<br> <br>Sometimes it means writing a fun script rather than doing some<br>boring task manually.<br> <br>Sometimes my imagination fails me and I can't make the dull<br>task interesting. In those cases, I end up taking breaks. For<br>example, here I am now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>The above commentary is based on what keeps *me* focused. Maybe<br>you could observe what's different when *you* are focused versus<br>unfocused and craft your own strategies from those observations.<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; what are you working on when you're [un]focused<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; how are you working on it<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; what sort of working environment do you have<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; what sort of deadline do you have<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; what time of day are you working on it<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; what else is pending in your todo queue<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (keep brainstorming questions here)<br> <br>-matt<br> </tt>
