<p>Well, <a href="http://geeknest.com/user/cwest/personal/oscontrip.txt">here</a> are my driving plans.  Don't bother telling me I'm crazy, it's been done.  :-)<br/><br/>It's a low cost alternative to flying the whole family.  About $400 to drive both ways, camping and buying food bulk before we leave.  That's opposed to $1200 for 2.5 seats on an airline that still leaves Pittsburgh.<br/><br/>Not to mention, my wife and I will share driving time.<br/><br/>I'm just glad I get to stay at two places with "Dead Horse" in the name.  :-)

My little family of 2.5 is flying from Pittsburgh to  San Diego tomorrow for a little less than $800.00. The fact that we are staying over two Saturdays probably helps though.<p> Alas, we are coming back the day that the conference starts; this is "just" a vacation.</p><p>And I won't say you are crazy, but I will say that <i>I</i> wouldn't try to do this in 3 days with an infant. I had a hard enough time doing it in 3 with just a wife and two dogs to worry about. Five hours on an airplane will be challenging enough for us.</p><p>

<p>My family's been taking road trips like that since I was<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.5.  I love cruising the western U.S. freeways, seeing the scenery.  It's a shame I don't get to take such a trip this year.</p>

<p>Have a good time, cwest!</p>

<h2>Insanity</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gnat/">gnat</a> on 2002-07-12T15:51:30</h3>
Your poor baby!  Kids who can't be entertained and have to stay in their chair make for MISERABLE road trips.  It's hell for us to go to Denver.  We certainly don't go to California any more.<p>

Expedia always seems to have the bargain basement fares.  It might been an interchange and not flying on a jet, but five hours of flying or ten hours from door to door is STILL better than the misery that this road trip would be.</p><p>

It's easiest to fly with kids when they're real young.  It's when they're 18 months or older and can kick seats and be pains in the ass.  Also, at her age right now, you and your wife can take turns holding her.  She'll need her own seat when she's older.</p><p>

Seriously--save your sanity and fly.  It can't possibly be worse than driving.</p><p>

Expedia can kiss my ass.  hotwire is currently offering $328 per ticket, round trip from Pittsburgh to San Diego, Jul20-Jul27.  I checked all the "I'm really flexible" options, so you might be leaving at 3am with two connectoins, but hey<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

I agree 100% with gnat and feel for the baby. Driving long distnaces is no fun for them.

this baby agrees.<br> <br>And I'm even a really big baby.  Driving for that long is no fun.<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; - ask (who will be driving 2 hours to get to San Diego).

Logical, as the best scenery is west of OK,
you might as well <br>
drive in the dark on the eastern segments.
<p>
Plan ahead for or around construction delays if possible,<br>
and check out <a href="http://www.speedtrap.org/" title="speedtrap.org">speedtraps</a speedtrap.org>.
<br>
Urban road construction delays are at night<br>
(in CA, at least).
