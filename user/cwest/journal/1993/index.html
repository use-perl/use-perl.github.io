<p>For those of you who were holding your breath, I did manage to get Linux installed on this dang Picturebook.  It's very sweet and well worth the wait.<br/><br/>Saturday, after staying up all night battling my Picturebook, I went skiing.  I'm a leader in my local Boy Scout Troop and it's one of the more fun things we go and do.  Last year I tried snowboarding.  Everyone else was doing it, why not me?  Well, I sucked.  I was the eternal yard sale.  Bad bad news.<br/><br/>
This year I decided to go for snow blades, hoping they would be just as easy as roller blading or ice skating.  As it turned out, they were.  I had the time of my life.  I was getting impressive air on jumps as well as ludicrous speed on the slopes.  I'll be using these from now on.<br/><br/>On Sunday I had Church in the morning (particularly good service this week) and in the afternoon I was able to relax while watching the Steelers humiliate the Browns.  All the while, snow was building up in vast quantities at my friends house.<br/><br/>I went to the department store and picked up a ski mask and some heavy winter boots and had snow ball fights with my friends.  We also did a little slead riding but that got boring after we were all hitting the garage at high speeds.  Then, our crowning achievement.<br/><br/>The largest snow ball we could roll.  By the time we were finished, this snow ball was about 7 feet in diameter.  We all needed a boost to get on top of it.  Quite impressive sitting out in my friends front yard.  I feel bad though, it will probably be there till July.
