<p><p class="hft-paras">In the end my talk went well. People are interested in building
applications with Perl, so that's good for me. More importantly, the
format I chose seemed to work for everyone. But lets talk about
something more interesting, like social mischief on the cruise.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">At dinner one night I decided, rather arbitrarily, that it would be
Karen's birthday. I got a waiter to work up a birthday song, cake, and
surprise for Karen. She was surprised. Now, to be fair, this was nothing
more than a cruel prank. Karen is a professional when it comes to
mischief, khaos, if you will. But how are you supposed to be good at
anything unless you work with the best? Naturally she promised to get me
back, but she never did. I guess I was too good for her.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">On another note, I learned that I like the cocktail &quot;sex on the beach.&quot;
Apparently, one of the waitresses at our favorite hang out thought it a
funny drink for me to be ordering. Every time I did she cracked jokes.
At one point she handed me her room key with the check! That was
embarrassing so to get her back I decided to learn how to order my drink
in her language. She's Phillippino, so I had to track down others on the
boat with the same nationality. That wasn't too hard. What was hard was
getting them to tell me how to say the phrase.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Eventually, I was lead to &quot;lampungan sa dagat.&quot; I practiced and
eventually ordered my drink. I got her back but then she turned it
around. I had ordered &quot;petting on the beach.&quot; What I really wanted was
&quot;cantungan sa dagat.&quot; Oh well. Randal got a picture of us since he was
sadly not doing so well with his favorite waitress.</p>
