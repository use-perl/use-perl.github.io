<p>Had music practice at church today.  Man I love playing the drums.  I didn't get to since I was on the cruise and I didn't bring any sticks with me.  There were drumsets all over the place but no sticks.<br/><br/>I picked up a new pair yesterday: black, hickory ones.  They're jazz sticks and very light.  They give a better response than the pair I had been using.  That's important because I play on an electic set with rubber heads.  They obsorb a lot of shock and it sometimes makes things difficult.<br/><br/>What I really need is that Roland Electric set with nylon heads.  Or, I could get a real rack mount set.  But that would have to stay at home to practice, in my office.<br/><br/>Someday...
