<p><p class="hft-paras">My youngest sister, a senior in High School, called me to get some
answers for an assignment. She asked me, &quot;are you busy, this will only
take two and a half seconds?&quot; Then the first question came. I took a
fifteen minute break.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">I haven't taken the time to consider these questions out loud, but I
have considered them for some time. Here they are.</p>

<p class="hft-paras"><strong class="hft-bold">Are you Democrat, Republican, or Independent, and why?</strong></p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockparas"><p>Independent, with conservative political views. To align myself with a
particular party would undermine my ability to choose as a
free-thinking voter. Political platforms span to wide of variety of
issues, it's impossible for any single party to get it right. So it's
important to vote on an issue-by-issue, candidate-by-candidate basis.</p></blockquote>

<p class="hft-paras"><strong class="hft-bold">How did your political views develop?</strong></p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockparas"><p>They developed from a conglomeration of family, friends,
and colleagues. Most importantly, however, my attitude has developed
through my own life experiences. Finally, it is important to continually
analyze your stance toward political issues and evolve them as
your beliefs take shape.</p></blockquote>

<p class="hft-paras"><strong class="hft-bold">How influential were your family, friends, and school in shaping your
political views?</strong></p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockparas"><p>As stated in response to question two, a large portion. It's important
to note that as I become a better-informed citizen,
those influences will diminish as my own views progress.</p></blockquote>
