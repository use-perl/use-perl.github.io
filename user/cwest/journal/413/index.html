<p>Well, I finally found a home for my BoF.  After it was kicked all over the planet, it will be Monday from 6pm-7pm, for sure.  A bit of humor just before the p5p meeting.
<p>
Of course, it will be just a <b>tiny</b> bit of humor if you folks don't step up and decide to make fun of someone!  I have about 10 minutes worth of acts and, well, I may have to resort to gnat taking the hour to pick on <b>everyone</b>.  It would be a riot I'm sure, just lacking variety in the viewpoint arena.  My impression of gnat would be:

<blockquote>
Hmmm... this off topic thread has been going on for days and stopped a few hours ago.  I better chime in.
<p>
<i>This is off topic, take it elsewhere!</i>
</blockquote>

Well, I think it's a funny thing.
<p>
It seems that the beginners CGI list had it's share of trolls today.  I had to swing my cluebat at the entire bandwagon which, seemed to pick up passengers thoughout the day.  Thank God it's finished.
