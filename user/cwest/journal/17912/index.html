<blockquote class="hft-blockparas"><p>Likely to be the first Bluetooth phone for Verizon Wireless. This
feature-laden clamshell also sports dual color displays, a camera with
flash, video messaging, and a memory card slot. Other features include
voice dialing, speaker phone, and BREW.</p></blockquote>

<p class="hft-paras">I'm stuck with Verizon due to coverage issues. I live in the sticks.
Everyone knows that Verizon, and CMDA in general, hasn't had any cutting
edge phones to date. Most importantly, no bluetooth. Their only camera
phone, which I have, is the LG vx6000. This phone has a camera, but the
software is horrible. My previous phones were by Motorola and Kyocera,
both have excellent software and UIs. I'm excited to hear rumors of this
Motorola phone reaching market by
Q2. We'll have to see.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">The features I'm most interested in a phone are pretty well covered by
the V710. Bluetooth is number one, followed by speaker phone, voice
dialing, and decent data options. The V710 has voice digit dialing,
which sounds very useful. That makes nearly all dialing options voice
accessible, which increases the utility of a bluetooth headset. I drive
a pretty fast six-speed car and make a lot of calls on the road, this
could save my life. The camera isn't on my top list, but it is a &quot;nice
to have&quot; now that I've got the photo blogging bug. Moreover, if Chastity
will get one of these too we can share photos and video. I can get clips
of my family while at work, and that only improves the quality of life.
The flash could actually make the camera phone not completely suck.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">The only thing I really don't like is that it's a flip phone. I like
candy bar styles very much, flipping is a pain. If I had my druthers,
I'd be using a Nokia 6820 right now. I'm not much for SMS, but maybe I'd
find it useful with a QWERTY keyboard built into my phone. Se la
vi.</p>
