<p>gnat proposed a community effort to get the entire hotel on the OSCON network wirelessly.  I've proposed several solutions but the largest constraints are the number of access points required (non-commercial grade) and finding rooms to put this stuff in.<br/><br/>So I pose a few questions.  Can anyone bring commercial grade access points that can bridge and become an access point at the same time?  Does anyone have amplified omni-directional antennas to slap on these things?<br/><br/>I'm looking for at least 6 of these beasties.  With them in place, hitting fringe spots in the hotel would be less difficult.  Two simple AP's with a crossover cable would be all that's needed to make a small cost node.  I have enough for one node myself.<br/><br/>Please reply and tell me what you can bring so I can get an idea of feasibility.

I have a linksys WAP11 boosted to max power output. No idea what it's range is though. I'll be bringing it with me though, if that helps.

Yeah, I've got those too.  It doesn't serve a large area and if we were using just wap11's we would need around 250 of them to cover the hotel because of the  optimal network configuration for this sort of structure.<br> <br>I'm looking for something larger.  A box with two radio's and some nice antenna equipment.<br>

<br>the linksys wap11's are just ~$120.  I can bring one; maybe more.<br> <br>(but I want one in my room if we don't get coverage otherwise =) )<br> <br>
