<div class="span8">
<p><p class="hft-paras">I've figured out how it will go down.  Not only will I make a
prediction for 2004, but for 2008.  I'll even make a vague prediction
about 2012.  I should note that I'm an independent.  I don't care for
either major political party.  Remember, this is my opinion and I
could be very wrong.  If you want to weigh in, post a comment or leave
a trackback please.  I'll buy a beer for you if I'm wrong for 2004.
The rest, I take no responsibility.  :-)</p>

<p class="hft-paras"><strong class="hft-bold">2004</strong></p>

<p class="hft-paras">Bush will win. The Democrats really hate Bush. They've created a
bad public image, though. As far as I can tell their platform runs
as follows.</p>

<ol class="hft-numbers">
<li> Beat Bush</li>
<li> Whatever Else</li>
</ol>

<p class="hft-paras">What's the problem here? Where are the <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">real</span> issues? I look forward to
the Democrats getting their act together, but I don't think it will
work for 2004.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Of course, Bush has a problem too. Yo! Guy! This is an election year!
Shouldn't you be, you know, running a campaign? I'm surprised there
hasn't been another Republican to step in and start campaigning for the
Republican candidacy. I mean, it's all but there for the taking. Sure,
another Republican won't win the primary, but at least the Republicans
will make some noise.</p>

<p class="hft-paras"><strong class="hft-bold">2008</strong></p>

<p class="hft-paras">Hillary Clinton will win. She's smart not to run this year, even without
her promise to finish six years in the Senate. I don't like Hillary, but
many Americans do. She's a strong candidate and with eight years of Bush
out of the way the Democrats will be pining for the rebirth of the
Clinton era. Besides, the Clintons are already pining for a rebirth of
the Clinton era.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Lastly, it's about time we have a female President. I must say that even
though I don't like Hillary, she'd be a good choice if it came down to
Man vs. Woman.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">I don't know who the Republicans will run, but I do know that it would
never be a woman.</p>

<p class="hft-paras"><strong class="hft-bold">2012</strong></p>

<p class="hft-paras">This is the tough one. I don't have specific candidates.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">This is the year Ralph Nador decides to stop running for President.
Republicans hate Hillary just as much as Democrats hate Bush today.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Republicans win. Hillary's tax hikes disturb the American public because
four years of hikes don't put a dent in the Bush deficit. People forget
that the deficit was caused by Bush but remember Bush for cutting taxes
and sending them checks.</p>
