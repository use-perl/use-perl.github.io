<p>If my politics were anything like my (american) football beliefs I'd be voting blindly for my local candidates.  That's what I felt like I was doing while rooting for the Steelers yesterday.  With one of their ugliest wins this season (and that's <em>hard</em> to do), I felt as if I aged five years in five hours.<br/><br/>I managed to figure out Pittsburgh's game plan though, play only one quarter with greatness, and choose that quarter by playing poker on Sunday where the losers have to drink themselves silly.  Note that players and coaches are allowed to play.<br/><br/>We literally managed to play everything poorly until the fourth quarter of the game.  I don't know if I can handle watching the game against the Titans on Saturday.  I'm glad I'll be skiing (or whatever it's called when you use those little ski blade things) that day and I'll likely forget the game is on.<br/><br/>Speaking of games, last night I decided to play a little snow bowl between friends and I managed to bruise my ribs pretty good.  I woke up this morning feeling not so good.  I am still in a state of not so good.  I should take some meds.<br/><br/>In other news, I'm really excited about work today.  Something about making systems talk that gets my heart pumping every now and again.  I don't know...<br/><br/><em>Understanding</em> - "Cheapskates Vol. 3" - <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Jeremy Camp%22" target="_blank">Jeremy Camp</a><br/><br/>
