<p>I'd like to rant about assumptions made when documenting large systems.  I'm glad I feel this way, because hopefully it will transfer into good docs for poest.<br/><br/>OpenSRS has some documentation.  The problem is that it's horrible.  It implies meaning and rules everywhere.  The assumption that an unexplained example will tell me all I need to know about how to do something is rediculous.  There is no way, in a single example, to tell me what I can and cannot do, you can only tell me one thing I can do.<br/><br/>I had written code that returned success from OpenSRS, only for me to find out that there was no success at all.  That I was not conforming, but the documentation didn't tell me that what I wanted wasn't allowed.  And it didn't tell me that the example was the only way.<br/><br/>I am mentally exhausted from trying to debug my code from response codes and failures.  It's guess work.  Sure, I like a challenge, I like the investigative process, but I don't like it when it is for (buzzword alert) mission critical application environments.<br/><br/>I'm tired now, and must sit on the porch in the amazing summer-like weather and vegitate.<br/><br/>
