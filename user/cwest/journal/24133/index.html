<div class="span8">
<p><p class="hft-paras">I own one tenth of one percent of a local ISP. So I had to sit on filing
my taxes until I received a K-1 form from them. So I got to turn my
taxes into the accountant today. Estimated completion is humorously
&quot;before Friday.&quot;</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Life seems to be going in fast forward but through Jello. It seems as
though things are moving very quickly but it's so very hard to move
forward. Not sure why that is. I haven't done much Open Source work
lately, which means there's a mess of things I need to do for my CPAN
modules. I intend to get to them.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Similarly, I haven't written anything in my journal for ages. I'm not
sure when this fell down. I haven't built charts to map posts over time
or anything. I've had a lot of real life issues and that could be a
part of it.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">I'm working on buying the house I'm in and I'm working on filing my
taxes. Chastity and I are having another baby so I have to think about
buying a new, larger car for her before September. Three car seats
really limits your options. And at the beginning of next year we plan to
move to Pittsburgh. As opposed to 30 miles outside Pittsburgh.</p>

<p class="hft-paras">So... how about that. :-)</p>

<p class="hft-paras">Maybe I'll write again tomorrow.</p>
