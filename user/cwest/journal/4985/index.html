<p>I just watched Star Wars II.  I've never been a huge Star Wars fan so I came into this movie with a nuetral perspective, unlike the rest of the audience that clapped when Lucas' name appeared on the screen as if they were in the same theatre.<br/><br/>I came out of the movie nuetral to Star Wars.  The entire movie can be summed up as thus: boring, action, boring, action, Yoda.<br/><br/>I would still recommend this movie, go see it, the effects are astounding.

Well, I've got to wait until next Tuesday when my boss takes the programming department to an "off-site meeting"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I just asked around the office. They said this sums up the movie perfectly. Even the people who really liked it.

<p>I didn't see the boring part, but there's a lot of it I don't completely remember so I might have missed it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Well I saw an entire trailer full of boring (the love yuck stuff). So I know it has to be in there somewhere<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<p>You know, not <i>all</i> hackers think love stuff is boring.  I hear some of us even have girlfriends/boyfriends, even spouses.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
