<p>Given that I am currently working in a production environment where versioning control is an on-going concern, the newly-released <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/INGY/only-0.10/only.pm">only</a> module from Brian Ingerson has been added to "to watch" list.<p>
This module allows for the installation of multiple versions of modules (without the establishment of entirely separate module installation trees) with the ability to load specific versions at run-time - This has the potential to be a real boon in this current production environment where issues with versioning control has resulted in the stagnation of application binaries and library modules for fear of disrupting legacy code.<p>
Up until this point, I have not been able to develop a firm decision as to the manner by which such legacy dependencies could be fulfilled while permitting the evolution of development and development environment - One possibility which I had considered was the use of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/AUTRIJUS/PAR-0.63/PAR.pm">PAR</a> to build self-contained packages of software.  The problem with this approach however came down to the additional burden associated with the maintenance and 
deployment of such application packages.<p>
While <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/INGY/only-0.10/only.pm">only</a> doesn't solve my problem entirely, it does provide a <u>very</u> useful installation and versioning mechanism which may form part of my solution - A module to watch ... </p>
