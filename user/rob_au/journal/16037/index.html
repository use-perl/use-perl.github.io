<p><p>We all have clients like this - They only call once or twice a year and generally their computer problems are relatively straight-forward and can be solved in under an hour with a bit of determination.</p>
<p>Last night, I went out to help one such client - The client was a lovely couple who needed an  updated version of their anti-virus software installed.  Over the last few years of looking after this couple's computer system, I have come to view these people as friends and have always found it hard to justify charging them for my visits, in spite of the work performed.  Yet this has always been a sticking point between us - They always insist on paying me for these visits, despite the friendship which has grown between us over this time.</p>
<p>I did however last night come up with a nice solution for this in passe which may be of interest to others with such clients - I again refused payment for the computer work carried out, but suggested that if they feel so compelled, the couple should make a donation to the <a href="http://www.rch.org.au">local children's hospital</a>.</p>
<p>This suggestion was warmly welcomed and thus everyone wins.</p></p>
