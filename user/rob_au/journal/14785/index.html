<p>After having spent the last two days writing a heap of code in C to address performance issues, it struck me, I should really learn C properly one day.  I saw this every time I have to do some C development work, but do I ever actually then sit down with a book and do some solid reading ...<p>
C'est la vie</p>

<h2>Book recommendation</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2003-09-19T14:58:22</h3>
I highly recommend Stephen Prata's <i>C Primer Plus</i>.  I also have his <i>C++ Primer Plus</i>.  I've owned many C books, and his is by far the best IMHO.



<h2>What is it you think you don't know?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jordan/">jordan</a> on 2003-09-19T18:07:17</h3>
If you've just written a heap of code, maybe you know it better than you think you do.<br> <p>Go read over <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/user/scs/C-faq/top.html" title="eskimo.com">The  clc FAQ</a eskimo.com>.  If there's a lot there you didn't know, then maybe you need some work.  By the time you finish, you'll probably have a pretty good handle on C, actually.<br> </p><p>The only tricky thing about C is pointers, I think.  I also think that understanding pointers is a pretty important thing to know.  A good handle on this allows you to understand a lot of the exploits that are plaguing the industry.</p>

Thanks for that link - It seems I'm not quite as clueless as what I thought.  I guess that to a certain extent, I am simply just not nearly as confident when working in C as what I am with Perl.
