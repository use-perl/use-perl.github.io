<p><p>I happen to like the idea of using cross database compatible SQL in my application code.</p><p>While this can produce somewhat horrific code (thank you Sybase for passing on to Microsoft the notion that only one query per database handle can be active at a time), most of the time i am happy with the extra planning trade off that allows customers to use a database that they are familiar with.</p><p>However, while testing a number of database backed packages of alternative products, it became horribly apparent how vital at least support for an embedded database is.</p><p>Because all i wanted to do is experiment with each application and see how it worked and if it matched with my needs.</p>
<pre>
rpm -i $PACKAGE

Database error.  unable to determine username / password to create database
</quote>
<p>Oh goody.  Thank you for making me find and read the sys. admin. notes on how to reconfigure the application to use my pre-installed and locked down database.</p>
<p>This takes time.  It's annoying b/c i have to evaluate a pile of these packages.  By the time i am actually looking at the working product, i already hate it for wasting my time.  B/c my job is not dealing with this package.  The package just helps???? me do my job</p> <p>Alternatively, if the installable package came including a pre-configured and instantly available SQLite database (possibly even with sample data in it) my first experiments with the package would have left me feeling much happier.</p><p>To be fair, any embedded product would probably be fine, including Embedded MySQL (which i've never used), it just needs to not depend on the user having a completely unsecured database installation to work.</p></p>
