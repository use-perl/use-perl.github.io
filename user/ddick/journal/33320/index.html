<div class="span8">
<p>recently had a bit of a unexpected issue with perl daemons refusing to come back up after a debian sarge -> etch upgrade.  It seems that any compiled modules are stuffed after the upgrade as the perl in etch has a completely different $Config{archname} than sarge.  This resulted in a few interesting surprises.  I'm sure i remember something somewhere talking about the reasons, but i can't remember where.  I can't see it in <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/release-notes">the debian release notes</a>, but i could just be blind.  at any rate, i would hope no-one else needs to suffer through this issue.</p>

At some point, for large applications, it seems that just compiling your own application-specific Perl is the only real solution.<br><br>BTW, what were the archnames changed from and to?

<p>well, i gave a talk at melbourne.pm a short time ago on building debian and rpm packages for perl applications, so agreed.  The interesting thing is that all the other changes that debian made (lintian had extra error checking added, a few modules needed to be upgraded) meant that a etch package should have been installable on sarge.  Now this is not the case.</p>
<p>the archname was "i386-linux-thread-multi" and is now "i486-linux-gnu-thread-multi".  call me paranoid, but i sense a politics vs practical battle was fought and politics seems to have won.</p>

On the plus side, this also means they can, nay, HAVE to clean out the backcompatible @INC bloat<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
