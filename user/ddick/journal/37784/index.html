<p><p>After an excellent <a href="http://popcorn.cx/talks/beyond-ascii/">talk on the Encode module</a> by <a href="http://popcorn.cx/about/">Stephen Edmonds</a> and a close encounter with the ÃÂµ symbol, i've been playing with the various unicode symbols a lot.</p>
<p>A missing component seems to be putting multi-byte unicode into a PDF document.  Try this little beggar &#29399; on for size.</p><p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PDF-API2/">PDF::API2</a>, <a href="http://www.htmldoc.org/documentation.php">htmldoc</a> and <a href="http://user.it.uu.se/user/jan/html2psug.html">html2ps</a> all seem to have problems with characters when the encodings uses more than 1 byte to represent 1 character. </p> <p>Anyone know a tool that can do the job?</p></p>

<p>I spent a few days just this week pinning down a bug in PDF::API2 that prints some characters from Unicode strings (in this case, just the Polish character set) on top of each other.</p><p>I nailed it. I just have to feed it back to its maintainers.</p><p>I have not tried it with your character, I don't even have a clue as to what character set it fits in (something CJK, but that's it) and thus, what font I ought to use.</p>

When is the last time that you updated PDF::API2? Because it is fixed in the latest release on CPAN (0.72).

Indeed. I first tried Debian's current package, which has $PDF::API2::VERSION set to 2.015, just like the current CPAN version, so I thought it's the current one. But Debian's libpdf-api2-perl is only based on 0.69.

<h2>PDF::Reuse can do Unicode</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grantm/">grantm</a> on 2008-11-03T23:45:50</h3>
<p>The maintainer of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PDF-Reuse/" title="cpan.org">PDF::Reuse</a cpan.org> accepted my patch to add this functionality earlier this year.</p><p>It's my understanding that if you stick to the built-in PDF fonts you're stuck with characters in the Latin-1 range (roughly speaking).  You have to use embedded fonts to get at Unicode characters outside that range.</p>

<p>That's correct.  Appendix D of the PDF Reference explicitly lists the <i>minimum</i> glyphs that must be supported in the 14 standard fonts.</p><p>That said, I would not be surprised if non-Latin-1 Unicode characters worked fine in one of the basic fonts on a recent mainstream OS.  To get Unicode in strings, you may need to employ to the hex notation (angle brackets).</p>
