<div class="span8">
<p><p>Attempting to note things without going insane with frustration.  SQL Server cannot handle UTF-8.  It can however handle UCS-2 (great for windows or java programmers), but in a bizarre fashion.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, char, varchar and text fields do not hold UCS-2 data.  nvarchar, nchar and ntext do.<\li>
<li>Secondly, quoting of data is somewhat different.  Instead of quoting data like so 'foo', it becomes N'foo'.</li>
<li>Now finally, when connecting with DBD::Sybase with underlying freetds libraries, you need to define "Client Charset = UTF-8" AND use the Encode module to encode your statement as 'UTF-8' before passing it to DBI->prepare.</li>
</ul>
<p>Salutations to the DBD::Sybase and freetds team for their excellent work in allowing perl to talk UTF-8 (at least the UCS-2 compat portion of it) to a database that doesn't even support it.</p>
<p>As a side note, i think that when constructing a test suite for a program that uses a database for a backend, it's essential to test the database itself for edge case conditions, such as in this case, making sure that you can fill a varchar(10) with ten three byte unicode characters AND retrieve it AND the retrieved value matches your expected result.  Cos maybe your definitions are behaving slightly differently than you thought.</p> </p>

<p>I've been having some difficulties with this.  In my case, I have trouble pulling data out of the database when it uses Windows special characters.  Any idea how to go the opposite direction?</p>

What sort of trouble are you having? In my case, I Encode::encode the statement before calling $dbh-&gt;prepare and when retrieving $row = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_hashref() i run Encode::decode on each field in $row.

<p>It appears to blow up for me on fetchrow_arrayref.  I'm not sure I get a chance to use Encode on what came back.  I might be able to hack into DBD::Sybase and do it in there.</p><p>I haven't had a need to do anything to the statement; everything I'm passing is straight ASCII.  The only problems I face are when I deal with records where people have inserted Windows charset members.  Then I get this message:</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>DBD::Sybase::st fetchrow_arrayref failed: OpenClient message: LAYER = (0) ORIGIN = (0) SEVERITY = (9) NUMBER = (99)<br> <br>Server , database<br> <br>Message String: WARNING! Some character(s) could not be converted into client's character set. Unconverted bytes were changed to question marks ('?').</tt></p></div> </blockquote>

<p>the client charset is set in freetds.conf and defaults to ISO-8859-1 (i think) which would die if windows characters are used.  set "Client Charset" to "UTF-8" and see what happens.  also, check the TDSDUMP file.  Mine has the following lines at the start</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>log.c:190:Starting log file for FreeTDS 0.82<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on 2009-06-11 04:50:38 with debug flags 0x4fff.<br>iconv.c:363:iconv to convert client-side data to the "UTF-8" character set<br>iconv.c:516:tds_iconv_info_init: converting "UTF-8"-&gt;"UCS-2LE"<br>iconv.c:516:tds_iconv_info_init: converting "ISO-8859-1"-&gt;"UCS-2LE"<br>net.c:210:Connecting to 192.168.122.35 port 1433 (TDS version 8.0)<br>net.c:264:tds_open_socket: connect(2) returned "Operation now in progress"<br>net.c:303:tds_open_socket() succeeded<br>util.c:162:Changed query state from DEAD to IDLE<br>net.c:779:Sending packet</tt></p></div> </blockquote>

<p>A year later, I'm still struggling with this issue.  Basically when I add client charset = UTF-8 to my freetds.conf file, I get "Out of memory!" thrown at me, with no apparent reason.</p><p>And strangely enough, my query runs just fine from the tsql freetds command-line program.</p><p>Do you happen to have any ideas?</p>

<p>First off, if you are hitting memory issues, are you trying to retrieve a text (as distinct from a<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/(?:var)?char/ field?</p><p>Secondly, can you set the TDSDUMP environment variable and post the output? checkout <a href="http://www.freetds.org/userguide/logging.htm" title="freetds.org">http://www.freetds.org/userguide/logging.htm</a freetds.org> </p>

<p>Found my answer.  It was a text field, and the default length was massively too long.  Apparently SQLServer defaults to something huge.  I could change it in freetds.conf, and that fixed the problem.</p>

<p>Also, TDSDUMP is really helping me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... thanks!</p>

<p>Even better, use the TDSDUMP variable when running against DBD::Sybase (the failure) and tsql (the success) and compare the debug logs to find the difference.</p>

<p>also, i found setting</p><p>
<code>
export TDSDUMP=/tmp/freetds.log
</code>
</p><p>to be a huge help, as you can then see what your data is encoded as it travels over the network.</p>
