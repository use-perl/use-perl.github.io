They don't get along.

<p>
As of the recent 1.07 release, <code>Perl::Critic</code>, has started using <code>Readonly</code> to be more more self-compliant with <cite>Perl Best Practices</cite>.  We had been avoiding use of <code>constant</code> for the reasons described in the book, but had not been willing to add the <code>Readonly</code> dependency until now.

<p>
The <code>Perl::Critic</code> coding standard has been to use sigils for subroutines in <code>@EXPORT_OK</code>, etc. and import lists, but <code>Exporter</code> treats them as optional.  And, in fact, there's code that strips them off (line 47 in v5.58).  I haven't figured out the commonality, but in a few environments, this fails spectacularly.  Once we removed the subroutine sigils from everywhere, the problems have gone.

<p>
Explicitness: 0, Keyboard laziness: 1.</p>

<h2>How to reproduce?</h2>

It would be helpful if you explain how to reproduce the failures you have seen. A test script or a short recipe would be nice.

<h2>Re:How to reproduce?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/elliot/">elliot</a> on 2007-09-17T01:25:28</h3>
This problem was been found on various Linux environments (e.g. <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2007/09/msg606459.html" title="perl.org">http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2007/09/msg606459.html</a perl.org>) when testing Perl::Critic; what is common between them other than Linux I haven't identified.  Since I don't have a Linux environment currently, I haven't traced down the exact circumstances.  Where the failure occurred was not consistent between different environments, so I ended up removing all use of subroutine sigils in Perl::Critic 1.075_001 and this fixed the problem.  If you want to play with this yourself, grab Perl::Critic 1.074 and see whether you can reproduce it.
