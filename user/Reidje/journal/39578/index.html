<p>I figure the flaw is, no one wants to get off their
butt and get anything themselves anymore...<br/><br/>You can do almost everything from home now-a-days.
With the invention of RSS Feeds, what's to say more
inventions won't be created, making today's net lazier.
Think about it. How fun would it be to get all your
info, through a text feed.. I dunno, it feels like
suckin it back through a straw to me..
Whatever happened to actually visiting a site for info,
visting the site to see what it looks like, and
try to spot changes in the design of the site.
I like to think of surfing the net as entertainment,
and also as an easy resource for school.<br/><br/>Not like a block of text on the newest thing.
Actually go and see what there is to see, how it
was meant to be seen....<br/><br/>The human race is getting lazier and lazier as it
tries to get machines and stuff do everything for
them... What happens when we perfect Robot AI,
do we end up with I-Robot? Wouldn't that be crappy..</p>
