<p>I'm looking for recommendations for good programming books covering GUI/windows/event programming.  All of my programming experience is script and web based, and I have almost no clue on how to go about creating a windowing based application.  I'd prefer a language nuetral approach, but am capable of following just about any language.</p>

<h2>Tk</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2002-02-16T02:27:26</h3>
The easiest cross-platform GUI programming "language" is Perl/Tk.  The book you'll want is called "Mastering Perl/Tk" (not to be confused with "Learning Perl/Tk").
<p>
Don't let the title scare you.  It's definitely the book you want.
</p><p>
From a Perl perspective there isn't much else in terms of cross-platform GUI libraries.  Heck, there isn't anything in print that I know of with regards to Perl and other graphical toolkits.
</p><p>
The only other graphical toolkits I know of that  have a Perl wrapper out there are GTK (unix only) and wxWindows.  There's probably something out there for QT and FOX as well, but I haven't seen it.
</p><p>
Many don't like the look and feel of Tk.  It's definitely not the slickest looking thing, but it works, it's easy, and it's very portable.  There's also a dedicated newsgroup (comp.lang.perl.tk).</p>

There's also Win32::GUI, if portability isn't a requirement.
