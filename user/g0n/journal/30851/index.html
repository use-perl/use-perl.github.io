Thanks to the comments of various people over the last few days at YAPC::EU, in particular cog's talk on wednesday, I seem to have talked myself into arranging a perlmongers group.
<p>
Currently there's a big gap in the map between Nottingham and Edinburgh, relieved only by a red dot in Hull. While that would be OK-ish for me (at least some of the time) it's not a lot of help for perlers in Leeds, Manchester, and points further north and west - I guess Nottingham is reasonably close for those in the Sheffield area. The WYPUG.pm group listed at pm.org seems to be inactive. From conversations with the potential members who were present at YAPC::EU, the idea would be to have quarterly meetings, varying venue to try and keep things fair to everyone. Manchester and Leeds are candidates for a first meeting, as they are reasonably central and well served by public transport.
<p>
We're provisionally calling this the NorthOfEngland.pm group. Alternative suggestions are welcome (although suggestions such as 'Whippets.pm','FlatCaps.pm' etc. are likely to be ignored ;-)).
<p>
Anyone interested in joining can subscribe to the <a href="http://g0n.net/mailman/listinfo/northofengland.pm">temporary mailing list</a>. When you subscribe to the list, please post a message introducing yourself, giving some indication of where you're located. We can register with pm.org when we've settled the geographic scope and name.<p>
<p>
Suggestions and comments would be very welcome.

Yup, I'm interested. The link to the mailing list isn't working for me though - DNS failure.<br/><br/>I've just proposed cumbria.pm - pretty soon we'll have the entire North peppered with little pms<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
