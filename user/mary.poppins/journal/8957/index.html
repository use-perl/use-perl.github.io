<p>While I've been a happy gaim user for some time, I miss the threading feature of email.  If I am discussing several topics at the same time with someone, it's not clear which topic an individual message addresses.<br/><br/>I can't think of a convenient user interface for threaded IM, however.  Perhaps the program would show, for each thread, all messages less than some age?  The user would select a thread before responding, perhaps with the most recently responded-to thread selected by default.

Is that you being assaulted in that picture?

Nope.  It is some 10 or 12-year-old girl in San Francisco, whereas I am an<br>adult.  I put the URL here because I think it's a really wonderful picture.<br> <br>If you're really interested, I might be able to dig up her name.<br> <br>The demonstrators were on the *sidewalk* on the golden gate bridge, but that<br>wasn't good enough for the police, who moved in and beat people.<br> <br>The punch line:  the adult relative she was with was arrested for "endangering a<br>minor" or some such.<br>
