<p>I'm a self-employed geek living in the US.<br/><br/>Any advice as to how to go about getting health insurance?  I'm thinking a
high-deductible "major medical" type plan, with infrequent routine stuff
out-of-pocket.  I'm young and healthy, with no family to worry about.<br/><br/>The ACM and IEEE each have group deals with insurance companies.  Anyone had
experiences with them, or with some similar deal?<br/><br/></p>

I was using something from <a href="http://www.workingtoday.com/" title="workingtoday.com">Working Today</a workingtoday.com> when I was contracting.  It seemed expensive to me, but people tell me it's cheaper than most of the others.



<h2>What state do you live in?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2004-06-25T17:01:09</h3>
If by some chance you live in Minnesota, and you can't get private insurance, you should check out <a href="http://www.mchamn.com/" title="mchamn.com">Minnesota Comprehensive Health Association</a mchamn.com>.  It's a state-mandated nonprofit which provides health insurance to those who are turned down for private insurance.  Their rates are about 10% higher than comparable private insurance, which isn't cheap, but it could be worse.  Other states may have similar plans.



<h2>Insurance</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2004-06-25T20:09:33</h3>
When I lived in Morgan Hill (South Silicon Valley), insurance was available through the Chamber of Commerce.



<h2>Tough to work out the math</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/VSarkiss/">VSarkiss</a> on 2004-06-25T22:29:06</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no easy answers.  There are lots of parameters to work out, besides the rates and coverage (which are complicated enough in themselves).  Whether a high-deductible plan will work for you depends on how often you think you'll visit the doctor, what your tax bracket is, and whether your coverage includes your family.</p><p><p>I opted for a fairly traditional HMO plan from <a href="http://www.kaiserpermanente.org/" title="kaiserpermanente.org">Kaiser Permanente</a kaiserpermanente.org> mainly because I'm familiar with them, so I know how to work the system; in particular, my children have an excellent pediatrician.  Given that I can deduct premiums but not co-payments or co-insurance from my taxes, that worked out the best for me.</p>
<p>Good luck.  Do your homework (a <em>lot</em> of  homework) and it can save you a ton of money.</p>
