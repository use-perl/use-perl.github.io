<div class="span8">
<p>Okay, it's about time for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670899240/qid=1020534239/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/104-9337922-4711918">Getting Things Done</a> to get <i>easier</i>.

<p>I need a way to keep track of my brainstorms. In particular a method for keeping track of thoughts that offers the following:

<ol>
<li>World-wide accessibility, because thoughts are being created at every moment, everywhere, so the mechanism for recording them needs to be equally accessible (yes, even in the shower).<br><br>
<li>Easy-to-use, and efficient (so that the time between the thoughts I have, and the time they're recorded is minimal, and so that there's almost no learning curve in being able to do so).<br><br>
<li>Searchable and scriptable, so that the system can answer questions/fulfill requests such as the following:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>What are all the ideas I've had for Perl modules in the last 3 months?
<li>How many of the ideas for Perl modules that I've had in the last 3 months did I actually implement?
<li>How many of the ideas for Perl modules that I've had in the last three months look like they may have been implemented on CPAN? (Returning in that case, a listing of some sort of everything from CPAN that looks like it might be what you were wanting to do).
<li>How many other Perl programmers are thinking what I'm thinking about Foo? (Returning in that case a list of names, email addresses, and a description of what their particular thought was for the context you're interested in).
<li>Send me an email that looks like [however you want to format such an email] if person A, B, or C thinks the same thing that I was thinking about such-and-such (or, say, if anyone else happens to think the same way).
</ul><br>
Of course, these are all Perly type questions, but the system's searching and scriptability should be general enough to satisfy the requirements of the idea domain relevant to you.<br><br>
<li>Collaborative, so that all the ideas of mankind (well, ok, the user's of this app anyway :) would be stored in a central place so that questions like the ones mentioned in the previous point can actually be answered. So a sort of "CPAN for thoughts".<br><br>
<li>Free (both speech and beer, so that you can think what you want and not pay a dime to do so), because in order for this system to be useful it shouldn't limit what you're allowed to think, nor should it make you pay to contribute your ideas. Though, for example, certain advanced features or business-specific spinoffs of such an idea management system might cost money at some point.<br><br>
<li>Integrated task management, because the logical next step to coming up with a good idea is setting the course for implementation.
</ol>

<p>Without trying to sound too off-the-wall, the net result of this killer app <i>truly</i> could increase the intelligence of mankind. Ideas wouldn't get lost in the fray of daily life, and wheel reinvention would be minimized.

<p>From there, the task management component -- categorizing tasks by context, effort required, cost, time needed, etc., ordering tasks, assigning tasks, etc. -- would provide the framework for efficient realization of ideas.

<p>But, enough brainstorming for now...my hot wings are ready. :)</p>
