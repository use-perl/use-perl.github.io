<p>Hmmmm...with four days left at my job, I'm not sure whether to just bow out and not do anything (work related) at all, or go just the opposite direction and try to accomplish as much as humanly possible in the next few days...</p>

<h2>End-of-job guilt</h2>

Been there, done that.  I left a job a couple of years ago where I made one final push to finish up some documentation on a project I was working on (we were in the "documentation phase" at the time).
<p>
All it got me was really tired and helped me deal with a misplaced sense of guilt I had for leaving the team.  A couple of years have past, and I can confidently say that no one has ever read those files, nor have they made one bit of difference to the people who are still working on that project.</p>

Unfortunately, I work at a gov't job, where I'm completely detached from the code. I mean, yeah I wrote a lot of it, but it is/was Powerbuilder...I HATE Powerbuilder and hope never to see it again once I'm out of here.

<p>Also, due to it being a gov't job, I work in an environment where it's easy to do nothing and get away with it (hence the "unfortunately" that began this reply...I need something to motivate me...), so it's hard for me to relate to feeling "guilty" about quitting the project.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:P</p>
