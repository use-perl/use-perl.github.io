<p>I did it.

<p>I <i>sold my car.</i>

<p>And you know what? It wasn't so bad really. Once I left the lot with my $1,600 check (I found a dealer who gave me $1,000 more than another offered, which is always nice), I realized what I had done, and more importantly what I can now <i>do</i>, which is move away from here.

<p>My mom came home shortly after I did, and burst into tears because it finally "hit home" that I was going to be leaving Winnipeg.

<p>Moms++ # cuz they're moms

<p>In the ensuing kaffufle (which probably isn't a word), she said something interesting:

<cite>Well, it seems like you're trying to find something, so I hope you do.</cite>

<p>I feel like maybe I am looking for something. 

<p>I don't want to live an oridinary nine-to-five standup joe type of life. I want to <i>be</i> and <i>do</i> good, party hard, hack Perl, do stupid things, travel around the world, date Playmates (did I say that or think that?), break up with Playmates (ok...I did say that...) and be someone that people won't easily forget.

<p>What's the point of living if you can't change the world?

<p>I sure as hell do <b>not</b> want to be one of those people who tells me "Yep Brad, if I was your age now, I'd be moving outta here too".

<p>I say, if you really wanted to move, you <i>would have</i>.

<p>In other news, I've stumbled onto an insane problem with pack(), whereby lexical variables in a calling function are getting modified because of the fact that the callee is making a call to a Win32::API function. I'm almost sure it's to do with the way I'm packing the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/sysinfo/time_8bqq.asp">structure</a> though, so I'll refrain from submitting a bug report.

<p><i>Back to hacking...</i></p>
