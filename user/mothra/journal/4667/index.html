<p>The more I learn about Win32::GUI, and now this really cool form designer The GUI Loft, the shorter -- to put it mildly -- my code is getting.

<p>Normally this is A Good Thing, except that I was hoping to send this code bit off with my CV to Kake and Simon, in the hope of showing London that I'm mildly clueful, which isn't easy to show when your paid programming experience doesn't involve Perl, but you know you want a Perl job. Something about chickens and eggs comes to mind right about now...

<p>Imagine...complaining about things being <i>too easy</i>. :)

<p>In other news, the car pictures turned out grrrrreat, which I'm very happy about. I'm going to scan them in (at my dad's) tomorrow, and might chance taking out a $90 big ad in the Auto Trader using one of those pictures, in the hopes that my understanding of human nature ("big ad! nice picture! must be good!") will pay off, in the form of a decent offer.

<p>The negotiating rounds with two car dealers yesterday didn't go quite as I'd hoped (but most certainly went as I expected), so private selling is still looking like my best option.</p>
