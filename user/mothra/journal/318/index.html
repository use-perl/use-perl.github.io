<p><p>Lunch break is over.

<p>It's time for a change.

<p>No matter what I try to do, I can't get away from knowing that the only thing I want to do right now is hack Perl. (well, okay, and perhaps a smattering of Python, Ruby, Lisp, et al. :) Well...okay, not the <i>only</i> thing, but YKWIM.

<p>My day job pays me to do Powerbuilder, YUCK. Though my OO design skills have definitely improved since I entered "the industry" around July/August 2000 (yikes...almost a year already?), there are few tools that make life more difficult than Powerbuilder.

<p>I'm sick of it. I need to follow my dreams. I need to do what I want to do, instead of staying in a job just because it seems more secure. I'm surrounded by 9-5'ers that just don't feel near the same passion for hacking that I do (except my supervisor, and our boss, but for the other 10-12 people I work with, programming is definitely just a "good-paying job").

<p>I'm going to start looking for a new job -- a job where I'm surrounded by those who think and feel the way I do about hacking. A job where I have the freedom to use the tools that I like (or those tools that I like are already being used), where nothing less than great code will pass the test, and where there are at least a few hackers from which I can learn a lot to help me perfect my craft.

<p>This job has worn me down. Ever since I got interested in Unix, I can't even do a good job of <i>pretending</i> to like Windows. It's just not my style, I've always like seeing under the hood. Working on such a shoddy development platform (($PB + $Win32) eq "blaargh") is detracting from the endless joy I used to get from playing with Perl, reading a great ORA book, and learning about Unix.

<p>I'm going to do The Right Thing.

<p>I'm getting a job I like.</p>
