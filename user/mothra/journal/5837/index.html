<p>w00t.

<p>Here I am. Yes it's true.

<p>Halfway around the world, starting my journey in London, England, searching for something that I can't put my finger on, not even sure if I'll know it if I find it.

<p>This is great though. Good fun, great people, interesting experiences.

<p>The first night (Tuesday) I was here (in London), I met up with london.pm at the Pillars of Hercules on Greek Street (thanks acme!). They bought me a few pints -- the poor travelling bum I am -- and good fun was had by all. Next week some time, we're going to try and get a few people out to go to the dogs. <i>That</i> would be wild.

<p>Wednesday night, I went out for a bite to eat at Ed's Easy Diner or something with grexnix. Checked out Spiderman after that (worth seeing again, especially since I was fairly exhausted by the time we actually went and saw it).

<p>Last night, I met quite a few people in the hostel at which I'm staying, including the most typical Valley Girl you could ever imagine (who asked me questions like "Which part of Canada are you from, Montreal or Quebec?"...ugghhh). It was good fun (especially when the Aussies and I started picking on the Ditsy Valley Girl), managed to get more beer given to me, and made it to bed at around 3 am.

<p>Slept until around noonish or so (maybe later, but who's counting?), and made my way down to the internet cafe to write this post.

<p>Since I've already done some of the touristy stuff when I was here in January (checked out Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, St. Paul's Cathedral, etc.), and I've got time, I probably won't do much more of that until next week (check out the Tower of London and the Tower Bridge, etc.).

<p>I plan to leave here in a week or two and go live on a beach in Greece for a month or so, to save some cash, and hopefully party hard all at the same time. I haven't yet decided if I'll stop in Spain and Portugal on the way there, or on the way back.

<p>For now, I'm going to go hang around Leicester Square and watch London live.</p>
