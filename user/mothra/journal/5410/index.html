<p>Wooooooo<i>hooooooooooo...</i>

<p>In less than two weeks I'm off to London, England again, except that this time I'm going to be hanging around a weeeeeeeee bit longer. :)

<p>The plan is to spend six months wandering the world in search of something more, something different, and quite simply, some kickass partying.

<p>I'll probably spend a week or two in London, before heading off to Spain by the beginning of July. I'm contemplating going to Ibiza, but it may be too expensive for someone who plans to be travelling longer than just a summer (30-60 euros just to get <i>in</i> to a club there! Yeesh...). Madrid and Barcelona (and perhaps Pamplona as well) are definitely places I plan to see.

<p>From there, I plan to wander into Portugal, Morocco, and come back on through Italy, and Greece (I've heard Ios is a fun place to be in the summer). Germany, France, and definitely a return to Amsterdam will be in order.

<p>I'm not ruling out the possibility of completely scrapping those plans if I happen to meet a few travellers that are willing to let me join them on a trek to Thailand or Australia or something, so we'll see what happens.

<p>Hopefully this also means a chance to meet Perl Mongers from all around the world, make new friends, and find a job overseas.

<p>If there's somebody reading this, and you happen to be in one of the countries I mentioned, drop me a line, give me some advice (good hostels, cheap places to stay, good party towns, your travel experiences, etc.), let me know of any Canadian-friendly employers you know of in European countries, or let me know of a PM meeting in your area between, say, Mid-June-Julyish.</p>
