<p>Something that would be nice to have:<br/><br/>The ability to embed a link to the project's source repository so that <a href="http://search.cpan.org">search.cpan.org</a> could display it.<br/><br/>You can do this by sticking something in the POD, but having it in a standard place (like Links:) would be much, much better:
<code>
  * You could find the project's repository without hunting through the POD
  * You could tell, at a glance, if a project has a repository that the author would like to share 
  * It would encourage users to contribute documentation and bug fixes

Have you taken a look at Github recently?  They have a system that is very close to what I think you're striving for.  The network view of project repositories (e.g. <a href="http://github.com/andychilton/cil/network" title="github.com">http://github.com/andychilton/cil/network</a github.com>), in particular, is a thing of beauty.</p>

Git complicates things, because PAUSE and svn are basically analogous, and everybody has an svn client, yet a lot of comments have panned the idea of building it out of svn because "git is cooler."

Tarballs.</p><p>I'm convinced at this point that svn4cpan will not happen anytime soon because I don't have the time for it and nobody seems interested enough to back it (after 3 rewrites/tries for a TPF grant.)  You could do it in pieces I guess, but I don't know how it will all get tied together.</p><p>Of course, when I started this git was but a gleam in Linus's eye, so maybe building it out of git will be practical in a couple more years at which point something else will be the cool new thing and it again won't get any support.</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.  A simple web view:  browseable url is the same as the checkout url, clicking on the filename downloads the file.  These might be nits, but IMO they are a barrier to discoverability.  Yes, I could build/install/whatever a view that does what I want, but a) we already established that I don't have the time and b) a GET on the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.git file must return the file, right?</p><p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.  The svn client is already installed or easily installable, and not strictly necessary anyway (see #1.)</p><p>So, what does git offer (for this use case) that svn doesn't?  Anyway, I give up.  If <em>you</em> are going to build it, use git.</p>

<p> <i>What does SVN offer for this that git doesn&#8217;t?</i> </p><p>One argument that I can see for subversion: git clients can deal with svn repositories, but not the other way around -- so if you want to make the system accessible by a maximum of people, a svn repository is the way to go.</p>

<p>What does git offer in this case that SVN doesn't?  The value of svn4cpan isn't "Hooray, let's create yet another hosting service for a fraction of the world to use, isn't this great!" but rather using directory versioning software to keep a history of all of the public releases on CPAN under version control.</p><p>A distributed version control system isn't at all interesting because you're not going to fork CPAN history.  That doesn't even make sense, at least not without a working time machine (and if you have a working time machine, you really ought to have better things to do than to change who uploaded what to PAUSE when).</p>

svn4cpan, and that my comment might have had all the welcome quality

Although I currently
have a preference for Git, I really think that svn4cpan is a wonderful
idea, no matter what kind of vcs ends up being its backbone.  My goal
was merely to point out a possible way to deal with social programing
that I find quite nifty and see what you
think of it (as you obviously spent much more time musing over a Perl global
repository than I have).

We currently have the META.yml key (which started this thread) for discovery of repositories, and everyone using it will improve things.  For now though, the existence of github just means that the landscape of repositories for CPAN modules will splinter more than it already was (it used to be that you would find the repository on sourceforge or perl.org or the author's own server, so now we have berlios, google code, and github too.)  All of these tend to try to solve general-purpose collaboration issues and offer solutions which work within their own context, etc.  None of that means much to a CPAN user wanting to figure out "$what broke $when" where $what may be one or more distributions and $when is a very simple linear sequence of said distributions having been released (despite claims that the ability to handle quantum releases is somehow necessary), and none of those systems will ever present a solution to those CPAN-centric issues.</p><p>But, I don't see this so much as a "social programming" problem, it's more about a historical record and discoverability (or at least, that's the chunk of our particular "social programing problem" which I chose to peel-off and attempt to solve.)  Subversion provides a web service and a versioned filesystem, which IMO is exactly what is needed to create, publish, and maintain a CPAN history.  With appropriate write access, said filesystem could also give every pause author a place to publish their work (including short branches of another author's work.)  If they prefer CVS, perforce, bitkeeper, git, darcs, mercurial, blah, blah, or blah, they could simply use WebDAV to upload a YAML file indicating the location and type of their repository.  That would take some standard/coordination to minimize pain on the client side, but would at least provide a standard place to start looking for forks/bugfixes/etc before you start hacking (and I would hope it could possibly become an accepted way to inform the author that you were interested in "trying something", as well as fun things involving smoke testing, documentations patches, etc.)</p><p>But these are just great and wonderful things which would be made possible by a simple versioned filesystem provided via a web service which paralleled CPAN.  I think that is the important point and that limiting the implementation to something this simple is key to avoiding centralization bloat.</p><p><div class="quote"><p>don't despair: all visionaries are eventually vindicated</p></div><p>Well, you can't eat "I told you so", but I have plenty of other unprofitable visions to pursue which are more important to me.</p>
