<p>Hello World! First journal entry... long time listener, first time caller...<br>
<br>
What motivated me to finally post is this simple sienfeldian question: "What is the deal with PerlMonks?"<br>
<br>
I'm looking at something that seems like the perfect troll ... specifically:<br>
<br>
<url:http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=606789><br>
<br>
Highlights include:<br>
<br>
<cite>is there a way to make tty:// really log into a system from a browser</cite><br>
...<br>
<cite>I want to experiment with [making] a custom protocol that could be used between a system and its proper clients that avoids spinning the firewall by disabling all the usual protocols and only accepting a custom one</cite><br>
...<br>
<cite>so that customers can get on board by downloading a protocol installation kit as soon as they have a formal relationship (e.g. a financial account) whose registration can be automated rather than needing lower level network modifications or hardware.</cite><br>
<br>
This post honestly made me laugh because it's got just enough technical basis to warrant "discussion", but it's so wildly silly if you actually know what you're talking about and it's received a fair amount of discussion and ideas around the pros and cons of implementation. Also, the person's nick is "Moron". And finally, what does this have to do <i>at all</i> with Perl? I can understand being <i>extremely</i> patient with new users, but threads like these really seem to lower the signal to noise ratio.
<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
Mike

<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=493758" title="perlmonks.org">Moron</a perlmonks.org> does not look exactly like a troll. He is an regular user at PerlMonks since 2004, has a pretty impressive level of XP and many good answers. Even if he's having fun, people there would usually take him serious and look on the positive side before being defensive.
