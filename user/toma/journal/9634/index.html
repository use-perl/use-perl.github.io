<h1>Flat file to XML round trip via XML::Writer and XML:Twig</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>I wrote a translator (described yesterday) 
that converts a particular
flat file format to XML, and another from the
XML format back into the flat file.<P>
The flat file has a line-at-a-time format with
the first token on a line determining the type
of the data on the line.  The lines are in a
hierarchical data structure, with various
first-position tokens specifying the hierarchy.
<P>
I made an object that contained an XML::Writer
object and a hash of anonymous subs, where the
key to the hash is the first-position token.
The code in the anonymous subs parsed the line
of the flatfile, and then send this data to
XML::Writer to create the XML formatted text.
I used four types of calls to XML::Writer:
emptyTag, startTag, endTag, and within_element.<P><br/><br/>The emptyTag calls were easiest.  No hierarchy,
just a single tag with parameters.<P><br/><br/>The startTag calls open up a section of hierarchy.
This is also easy.<P><br/><br/>The endTag calls were slightly trickier.  My code
could detect where a piece of hierarchy was
supposed to end.  To remember what kind of closing
tag is needed, the within_element call detects
if a particular tag has been opened.  This
approach wouldn't work for multiple levels of
hierarchy, but this format doesn't have that.
Other tools with different formats may have
this requirement, so this may need to be
revisited someday.<P><br/><br/>Any good translator should make a lossless
round-trip with the data, unlike babelfish.
I used XML::Twig to process the data and recreate
the flat file.  I used a hash of TwigHandlers,
which called separate subs for each type of
tag.  I noticed that there is symmetry in the
code with the parser and the writer of the
data, particularly in the code that has to
read the flat file and understand the order of
the fields.  This same ordering is needed to
take the XML field values and put them into
the flat file.  I was not able to take advantage
of this symmetry, so I ended up with code that
I feel could be improved somehow.  I also ended
up with the fields being described in the
module documentation, so now I have the order
in three places instead of one.  Darn!<P><br/><br/>I used the XPath approach to parse the XML.
I had the problem that the flat file data was
not available until the closing tags were
parsed, so things tended to come out in an order
reminiscent of reverse polish notation.  I used
some local variables to store things so that
they could be written out in the correct order
once the closing tag was detected.  This is
analogous and possibly symmetric with the endTag 
manipulations in the XML writer.  Once again,
it will cause problems when deeper hierarchy is
needed and is an opportunity for removal of
redundancy in the code.<P><br/><br/>The biggest challenge in this project was
determining the proper type of calls to use
in XML::Twig.  There are many to choose from!
XML::Writer was much easier.  This follows
the general principle that it is easier to
transmit than to receive.<P><br/><br/><B>New Modules and other activities</B><BR>
Installed Spreadsheet::WriteExcel with cpan.<BR>
Install okay.<BR>
Tried test program from previous version (0.39)
It broke compatibility with gnumeric, so I reported 
the problem to jmcnamara with msg on perlmonks.
I hope he fixes it, I really like both WriteExcel
and gnumeric.<P><br/><br/>Installed Math::SnapTo with cpan<BR>
Install was okay, except I got an old version
so I reinstalled by hand, which worked fine.<BR>
Tried a bunch of test cases, I wouldn't use this
module - it seems to have many bugs.<P><br/><br/>Posted on problems with a new snippet.  Noted that 
root cause of rounding problems were caused 
by typing lots of digits of pi instead of 
using 4*atan2(1,1).</p>

<h2>SAX</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-12-26T22:34:58</h3>
For what it's worth, it sounds like what you're doing is a job that SAX is perfect for - reading, transforming, writing. SAX cleanly gives you these layers in a well designed manner. Unfortunately the book you're learning from doesn't cover SAX very well, because it was started before the XML::SAX project was finalised, however there's another book published by New Riders called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/202-9558450-5206237" title="amazon.co.uk">XML and Perl</a amazon.co.uk> which is supposed to cover SAX better (I haven't received my copy yet).<br> <br>Not that you'd re-write all this now you have something that works, but this might be useful for future reference.

I'll give SAX a try.  I have no problems with
rewriting all my code, especially since I am
trying to create an example for others to
follow, not just a quick solution for a specific
problem.<p>

Perl &amp; XML has a chapter on SAX.  I'll start
there, and I have ordered the New Riders book.
Let me know if you have more recommendations
for good SAX tutorials or documentation!
Otherwise I'll just start slogging through
XML::SAX::Intro and friends.</p><p>

As I mentioned, I am particularly interested in
exploiting the symmetry between reading and writing
a quasi-flat (lumpy?) file.  Is there a trick
that will let me accomplish this?  The
existance of such a trick would be a light
at the end of the tunnel for me.</p><p>

I would like to be able to
create a SAX driver for my non-XML source that
can do this.  This would enable me to
change the code in only one place when I
need to fix a bug or adapt to changes in
the quasi-flat file format.  As my code stands now,
I will have to change both the reader and the
writer.</p><p>

Thanks,<br>
-toma</p>

Unfortunately in SAX readers and writers are distinct too, simply because the operations tend to be very different. So you would have to write separate modules that did both.<br> <br>However there's nothing stopping you unifying some of the code if it's relevant to do that. You could put functions that you would use for both reading and writing in a separate package.<br> <br>A good example to look at for readers is Pod::SAX. Also check out XML::Generator::DBI. As far as writers go, there's not much detail on them. I tend to use readers only, and for writing I'll use a formatter like XSLT, but you probably need something a bit more strict with regard to whitespace than XSLT. Luckily SAX is optimised for filtering/writing, so those will be the easy bits.
