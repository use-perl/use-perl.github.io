<p><B>XML and Perl</B><BR>
Received and read part of "XML and Perl" (New Riders).
This isn't a book review, leave that to people that
understand the subject better than I do.  These
are just my notes!<P>
The book is useful but does not provide much new info for me.
It spells a few things out clearly that are otherwise
hard to figure out, with line-by-line code walkthrough.
<P>
Here are a few of the gaps:<br/><br/><OL>
<LI>It says that XSLT can be used to transform
    XML into CSV and other non-tagged formats,
    but the example code just shows the usual
    XML to HTML translation.</LI><br/><br/><LI>The SAX code has a bunch of case statements in the
    handlers for which kind of tag is being processed.
    I would prefer to see this coded another
    way with SAX.  I try to avoid big case statements.
</LI>
</OL>
I liked the section on XML Schemas,
since I didn't know anything about them.<br/><br/>I can't say that the book helped with today's particular
problem of interest.<P><br/><br/><B>Trying SAX Modules</B><BR>
Installed Pod::SAX with cpan.  This has many dependencies,
including XML::SAX::Writer.  Installed okay.  Pod documentation
for the functions is missing.
This style of code doesn't look like the kind of code
that I like write.<P><br/><br/>Installed XML::Generator::DBI with cpan.  
It failed tests looking for DBD/Pg.pm, there
is some manual configuration that needs to
be done.  I didn't pursue this further because
I have no database on this machine.  The code
is interesting to read though, both as an example
of using XML::Handler::YAWriter and a nifty
flexible DBI query.<P><br/><br/><B>Other activity</B><BR>
I installed psh and fooled around with it.
It looks like fun, but possibly dangerous
since I don't know what I'm doing.
My shell needs to be very reliable, eg rm commands.
<P>
I installed File::List, and wrote and example 
program using File::Flat with it.
I posted this snippet as an answer to a question at 
perlmonks.</p>

<h2>On SAX</h2>

<i>The SAX code has a bunch of case statements in the handlers for which kind of tag is being processed. I would prefer to see this coded another way with SAX.

It has a tendency to contain a large case statement with things that say: "If tag is <i>this</i> do this. If tag is <i>that</i> do that."<br> <br>I'd welcome alternate ways of designing SAX handlers though. Unfortunately that tends to be the way data driven code works.<br> <br> <i>Trying SAX Modules<br> <br>Installed Pod::SAX with cpan. This has many dependencies, including XML::SAX::Writer.

It tends to inforce a certain way of writing code unfortunately, and I find it a bit hacky. Though I would appreciate it if you could be more specific as it might help me clean up the module.<br> <br>The docs suck, I know. I'll work on that. It's tricky because partly I want to say "Uses SAX, generates XML that looks like this", but obviously that's not enough for most people.<br> <br> <i>Installed XML::Generator::DBI with cpan.

<i>I'd welcome alternate ways of designing SAX handlers though.

</i> <p>

I'm not really knowledgable enough about SAX to
understand this design problem to make a good
suggestion, but I won't let that stop me.</p><p>

I have been using XML::Twig and XML::Writer with
some success, and have enjoyed the XPath features
in XML::Twig.</p><p>

Instead of writing a large case statement,
I usually use a dispatch table.
Typically I use a hash of anonymous subs,
where the key to the hash is the name of the tag
or XPath specification.
I like AUTOLOAD capability, although I only use it
when I have no other way to know the name
of a function in advance.</p><p>

A dispatch table can translate XPath
specifications into subs that load XML
subtrees into compact data structures.
This retains most of the small memory usage of
parsers, while providing the ease-of-use
of a DOM approach.</p><p>

But really I'm just learning.  I have worked
with simple XML configuration files
and 70MB XML CAD archives,
and yet I feel like I am just getting
started and I have little confidence.</p><p>

One thing I am convinced of is that
I need hierarchical data structures, and I
am really benefitting from using XML and the
associated paradigms.  Thanks for making XML
better, and helping me with my projects!
</p><p>

Ah, if it's XPath based dispatch tables you want then check out XML::Filter::Dispatch. It's XPath capabilities are even more powerful than XML::Twig's.

I tried XML::Filter::Dispatch and had some
success, but then I ran into a problem with it.<p>
I posted a question about this at
<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=225745" title="perlmonks.org">

<h2>Huge case statements</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pdcawley/">pdcawley</a> on 2003-01-05T19:40:31</h3>
The more I read about SAX programming the less I like it. I'd look at turning the element data structures into first class objects:<br> <code> <br>sub start_element {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $self = shift;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $e = ElementFactory-&gt;make_from_struct(shift);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $e-&gt;start_with_parser($self);<br>}<br> </code> <br>And have <code>start_with_parser</code> do the double dispatch trick:<br> <code> <br>sub MyElement::docbook::para::start_with_parser {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $self = shift;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $parser = shift;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $parser-&gt;start_docbook_para($self);<br>}<br> </code> <br>Of course, this can lead to a proliferation of classes, but careful protocol design can fix that somewhat, for instance, you might be able to have all your docbook elements share a class and do:<br> <code> <br>sub MyElement::DocBook::start_with_parser {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $self = shift;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $parser = shift;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $method = "start_docbook_" . $self-&gt;element_name;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $parser-&gt;$method($self);<br>}<br> </code> <br>Combine all this with the State pattern and you have a powerful and flexible system that doesn't suffer from the 'huge case statement' problem. Instead suffers from the 'where does stuff happen? ' problem, but I happen to think that that's an easier problem to deal with because at least the things that happen have sensible names.<br> <br>XML Filters might require a little more work, but a simple pass through AUTOLOAD should fix most of your problems (you'd need to map back from your protocol's method names to the appropriate SAX method calls, but unless you're handling some of the more arcane corners of SAX you can probably do that with a simple hash look up based on the first part of the method name -- <code>start_*</code> becomes <code>start_element</code>, <code>end_*</code> becomes <code>end_element</code> etc.)
