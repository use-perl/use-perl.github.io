<p><B>Comparing Twig and Dispatcher</B><BR>
I rewrote my XML::Twig program 
to use XML::Filter::Dispatcher
in order to compare the approaches.
I compared the simplicity of the code 
necessary to do the job, 
and the speed of execution.<P><br/><br/>The result was that XML::Twig ran 17 times faster,
which surprised me.<P><br/><br/>The Dispatcher code was cleaner
than the Twig code.  This is because I
was able to remove the code I wrote to get
my Twig return values to come out in the
correct order.  The order of the data from
Dispatcher worked the way that I had 
orgininally hoped that Twig would work.<P><br/><br/>The speed is a big deal for me,
because the Twig code is actually already
slower than I would like it to be.  The
Dispatcher code is probably
not fast enough for my application.  
I'm tempted to write the code again and
use a format other than XML to see
how fast it runs.<P><br/><br/>It would be nice if I had a program that
would automatically measure the complexity
of a perl program.  I would like to be
able to compare the complexity of the
implementations with a numerical technique.<P><br/><br/>If anyone wants to see the two approaches
and the test data, let me know and
I'll post it on <A HREF="http://tomacorp.com/">
tomacorp (We're not a corporation)</A>.<P><br/><br/><B>New Module Testing</B><BR>
I installed and tried PerlBean, which looks
useful for automating the generation of
perl objects.  Before I use it in a real
project, I need to understand if there is
a way to use it so that the classes can be
redesigned without losing work.
The straightforward way looks like you would
have to edit the class by hand after the
initial run of the module, and if you want
to run it again you would have to cut and
paste the custom methods in again.<P><br/><br/>Perhaps there is a way around this.  PerlBean
would make a good core for a perl IDE,
I think.<P><br/><br/>I sent a bug report to the author of
PerlBean.  It looks like the tutorial didn't
get an update after an API change.<P></p>

<h2>The Need for Speed</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barries/">barries</a> on 2003-01-13T18:47:39</h3>
XML::Filter::Dispatcher is definitely slower than TWIG.  It's still young and it will probably never be as optimized as TWIG is for TWIG's purpose.

<p>That being said, you may want to look at the struct() and hash() extension functions that return Perl data structures something like TWIGs. &lt;plug&gt;My shiny,
       tiny new <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/RBS/BFD/lib/BFD.pm" title="cpan.org">BFD</a cpan.org> module might help you see them:</p><blockquote><div> <tt>&nbsp; &nbsp;'foo' =&gt; [ 'hash()' =&gt; sub { use BFD; d xvalue } ],</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>;)&lt;/plug&gt;.

</p><p>Along with optmization, I'd like to enable X::F::D to generate single-purpose handler or filter classes from rulelists and, optionally, save them to<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.pm files.  In other words, you should be able to ask X::F::D to generate MyTwigger.pm (or MyFooFilter.pm, say).  This would be a complete SAX handler (or filter) class that would run lots faster than the interpreter in XML::Filter::Dispatcher.

</p><p>X::F::D isn't meant to compete with TWIG, it's meant to allow for more intricate SAXual relations between XML and Perl than TWIG is.  So it's likely that TWIG will always be faster than X::F::D if you're doing purly TWIGy things.  I'm using it when (a) programmer convenience matters more (which is often) and/or (b) when TWIG doesn't do what I want (which is also often, because I'm picky). YMMV.

</p><p>Once X::F::D is more stable (it's still beta, having only recently graduated from alpha in my mind), I anticipate some significant optimizations, especially in cases where its processing lots of rules.  And even more performance should be possible when it allows you to generate those one-off classes and Perl modules from rule lists.

</p><p>The generation of Perl modules (as opposed to just generating classes in memory) will mean specifying actions as strings instead of CODE refs ("foo()" instead of "sub { foo() }").  Those should rock.

<h2>Please do</h2>

<blockquote><div> <i>If anyone wants to see the two approaches and the test data, let me know and I'll post it</i> </div></blockquote>
Yes, please. You see, I've written my own, (as yet) unreleased XML parsing module which, from the little I know of XML::Twig, and judging by the name of the other module you mention, sounds like it's pretty much in the same realm. Before I even contemplate of releasing it, I'd like to port your test script in order to use my own module, and compare code and speed to the two modules you've used.
