<p><p>Perl culture is in dire need of fresh showcases and new success stories. When someone asks about desktop software written in Perl, <a href="http://www.frozen-bubble.org/">FrozenBubble</a> usually springs to mind and then what?

<p>I think it's very cool that <a href="http://shutter-project.org/">Shutter</a> is written in Perl with all kinds of GNOME goodness like using GooCanvas based on Cairo, installing a notifying icon and being a ÃÂ«Made on UbuntuÃÂ» software.

<p>Try it, it is very feature rich, translated into many languages (my interface is in Russian, e.g.) and a beauty to look at.

<p>And now I'm going to try to insert some screenshots. Looks like <a href="http://www.slashcode.com/">Slash</a> does not support inline images at all :(

<p>gScan2pdf is another example of perl on the desktop. Small, robust, and does exactly what it says on the tin.</p><p>You can scan it, rotate it, then save it as a pdf.</p><p>Never have to revisit xsane again, which I find a joy when I just simple want to photocopy or email something.</p>

<p>Gald that it works for you. I have a different experience. I had to add three different repositories to be able to install shutter. Still then, starting it fails with:</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>Can't locate Gnome2.pm in @INC<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>I'm not going to report it because it's the authors' own damn fault for not using community practices. Had they packaged it the standard way then the chance for such a dumb mistake like neglecting to declare a dependency would have reduced dramatically. Another way how this sort of shoddy coding manifests in the source is the layout (the program is one big 250 kilobytes file), and the total lack of POD or really any sort of documentation in the package. It's Perl alright, but it's mediocre Perl, and IMO nothing to get excited about. Contrast with Xacobeo, which I consider a pretty good example of a Perl-Gtk2 app, actually installable from CPAN.

</p><p>I the meantime I press PrtScr and it actually works - Ksnapshot comes up and lets me save my screenshot. For editing and adding effects a dedicated application is better anyway, I don't know what place most of those plug-ins have in a snapshot program.</p>

IMO we need a nice graphical user guide or something like this. Shutter is not a module used by devs where a good POD is essential.</p><p>It's the old question: principle or pragmatism?<br>For me it was more important to implement features that were requested by our users in most cases instead of doing everything the "RightWay".</p><p>Regards<br>Mario</p>

<p>WRT CPAN, what daxim was saying (not at all tactfully) is that it's possible to do both CPAN and packages.</p><p>CPAN acts as the canonical form of the code base, and the distributions act as the primary download channel for users.</p><p>And because there's a fairly large amount of automation you can leverage, it's actually easier to generate packages for many different distributions.</p><p>With the CPAN stuff, you also get the RT queue and the other resources to help with bug tracking and so on.</p>
