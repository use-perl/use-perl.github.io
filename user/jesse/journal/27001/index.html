<p>Day changed to 05 Sep 2005
13:12 -!- mdiep [~matt@bursley-221-209.reshall.umich.edu] has joined #parrotsketch
13:54 <mdiep> obra: is there a meeting today? (7 minutes from now)
13:58 <mdiep> guess not
14:00 <@obra> Hello
14:00 <@obra> Yes
14:01 -!- chromatic [~chromatic@sub17-30.member.dsl-only.net] has joined #parrotsketch
14:16 -!- #parrotske chromatic H   1  ~chromatic@sub17-30.member.dsl-only.net [chromatic]
14:16 -!- #parrotske obra      H@  0  ~jesse@69.25.201.132 [Jesse]
14:16 -!- #parrotske mdiep     H   2  ~matt@bursley-221-209.reshall.umich.edu [Matt Diephouse]
14:16 -!- End of /WHO list
14:16 <@obra> Hey chromatic.
14:17 <@obra> I've been off-net for the past 2+ days. looks like failure to send mail caused a cascading failure
14:22 -!- Nicholas [~nwc10@colon.colondot.net] has joined #parrotsketch
14:22 <Nicholas> chaos at London Bridge station
14:22 <Nicholas> signal failure or somesuch
14:23 <@obra> Yikes
14:23 <@obra> Appears almost entirely quiet here 
14:23 <Nicholas> not that unusual
14:23 <chromatic> I failed to send the summary last week, because of mail server failure and then forgetfulness.
14:24 <Nicholas> do you know how the summaries of the conference call were going to be made available publicly? I thought that it was supposed to start by now
14:25 <@obra> Nicholas: I believe you want to talk to luke about that.
14:25  * chromatic agrees
14:25 <Nicholas> OK
14:30 <@obra> so, nicholas / chromatic / mdiep.
14:30 <@obra> anything new with you and perl6?
14:31 <Nicholas> hammered away at things last Monday and got Leo's new PMC class to do reference counting
14:31 <Nicholas> *that* works
14:32 <Nicholas> I now find that I'd already got ponie-specific code to track all the PMCs, to replicated the ability of perl to iterate over the SV heads at destruction time
14:32 <Nicholas> and I've rediscovered that I had to code it carefully to allow deleting from a hash that is being iterated over
14:33 <Nicholas> so I don't know if I can directly/easily throw it out and iterate over the new PMC-that-does-the-reference-counts
14:33 <Nicholas> ideally all this code will go
14:33 <Nicholas> but I don't know how parrot does global destruction
14:35 <Nicholas> and I've not yet had time to look
14:35 <chromatic> I'm not sure Parrot does global destruction yet.
14:35 <chromatic> _exit() doesn't count.
14:35 <Nicholas> _exit() does not
14:36 <Nicholas> if parrot doesn't yet allow the option of global destruction, then I'm going to need to keep some sort of hack until it does
14:36 <Nicholas> also, I don't know how weak references are going to translate into parrot
14:36 <@obra> ok. sadly, we have no chip and no leo around.
14:37 <@obra> Have you sent mail to p6i asking how they cope?
14:37 <Nicholas> no, not yet
14:37 <@obra> ok
14:37 <Nicholas> only just started to think about this sort of stuff
14:37 <chromatic> I had an outstanding design issue about finalization (for NCI) several months ago.  That should go ok the B0rked list.
14:37 <Nicholas> still feeling quite shattered after a week in Braga
14:38 <Nicholas> as you have a firmer idea of what you need, are you able to do that?
14:38 <Nicholas> I'm not even sure how much of the perl 5 semantics are really necessary
14:39 <chromatic> I don't need *reliable* destruction for that, but I do want to release resources at some point.
14:40 <chromatic> Sorry, I mean reliable *timely* destruction.
14:40 <Nicholas> for the perl 5 case I don't need reliable timley
14:40 <Nicholas> It's the "all remaining resouces must be finalised at program exit"
14:41 <chromatic> Not even program exit.  For NCI, when using unmanaged pointers, it's nice to free them somehow.
14:42 <chromatic> This is important when using limited resources such as screen buffers or file descriptors, of course.
14:42 <Nicholas> ah right
14:43 <Nicholas> they need to be "garbage collected" in some fashion before they run out
14:43 <chromatic> I still think separating finalization from garbage collection is important.
14:47 <@obra> So. anything else reportish?
14:47 <chromatic> Not here.
14:47 <Nicholas> yes, I agree on finalization/GC
14:48 <Nicholas> and nothing else to report. Last commit I made was about 169 hours ago
14:48 <chromatic> I see Matt sent in a HLL proposal.
14:58 <@obra> So, I bet that about wraps it up for this week.
14:58 <@obra> next week, I'm home, so I'll send reminder mail
14:58 <Nicholas> OK
14:59 <chromatic> Thanks.  Take care, all.
14:59 <Nicholas> I should be on time. Barring fire, floods or the usual UK rail system woes
14:59 <chromatic> That's why we won the Revolutionary War, you know -- better public transportation, or at least less bad.
14:59 -!- chromatic [~chromatic@sub17-30.member.dsl-only.net] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
15:00 <Nicholas> spot the Porland resident. :-)
15:08 -!- mdiep [~matt@bursley-221-209.reshall.umich.edu] has left #parrotsketch []
15:08 -!- Nicholas [~nwc10@colon.colondot.net] has left #parrotsketch []
