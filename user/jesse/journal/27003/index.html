<p>14:00 <obra> 'Afternoon
14:00 <Nicholas> g'day
14:01 <chromatic> Hello.
14:01 <mdiep> ahoy :-)
14:04 <obra> I've poked chip
14:05 <Nicholas> transcontinental poking device, or is he still east coast this week?
14:05 <obra> transcon
14:05 <obra> Unfortunately, I need to vanish at the end of the hour today.
14:05 <chromatic> It's past the hour; should we start or wait for others?
14:05 <obra> I was hoping that chip, leo and patrick might appear

14:05 -!- #parrotske Nicholas  H   2  ~nwc10@colon.colondot.net [Nicholas Clark]
14:05 -!- End of /WHO list
14:07 <obra> But given the time, let's get cracking
14:08 <obra> matt. what have you been up to?
14:08 <mdiep> I've mostly been dealing with real life. but coke has managed to switch to using exceptions for Tcl in leo-ctx5
14:09 <mdiep> before we were returning a status variable (OK, ERROR, BREAK, CONTINUE)
14:09 <mdiep> this should give us a chance at interoperability
14:10 <obra> Very cool
14:10 <obra> Are there things you're currently blocking on?
14:10 <mdiep> we've also managed to get a ~20% speed boast between that and the new calling conventions
14:11 <mdiep> I have a couple questions for chip/leo regarding namespace stuff
14:11 <mdiep> also, we'd really appreciate it if we could merge the leo-ctx5 branch back in
14:12 <mdiep> at this point, we pretty much have to maintain two codebases for tcl
14:12 <chromatic> Yeah, I'm curious about the status of the merge and the September release.
14:12 <obra> I know chip at least started to do the review to get ctx5 merged back in
14:12 <obra> Were he here, we'd know more ;)
14:13 <mdiep> exactly. :-)
14:13 <mdiep> so that's it for now.
14:13 <obra> ok
14:13 <obra> Nicholas: what's up?
14:14 <Nicholas> @work. (pesky xen boxes and ill sysadmins). No ponie at all this week. Done quite a bit of 5.8.8, but that's
                 off topic
14:15 <Nicholas> [plus found volunteers to do p5p summaries, got 2 new committers, reorganised the todo]
14:15 <obra> all good news for perl5
14:15 <Nicholas> No new questions, but was hoping that chip would be here to answer at least my first (about autogenerating
                 extend.c)
14:16 <obra> ok. autrijus, you here?
14:16 <chromatic> I should just send in my extend.c patch, as incomplete as it is.
14:16 <obra> ok, chromatic
14:17 <Nicholas> sounds like a good plan
14:17 <obra> how close is your extend.c patch?
14:17 <chromatic> It appears to generate all of extend.c that's there now from a C API point of view.
14:17 <chromatic> It loses comments.
14:17 <chromatic> I think it also adds a few things that might not ought to be there.
14:17 <chromatic> But it's a first sketch.
14:18 <obra> neat
14:19 <obra> Any other parrot hacking on your plate recently?
14:20 <chromatic> Not for me.
14:20 <chromatic> I just returned from vacation to a huge pile of work-related e-mail.
14:20 <obra> fun!

14:20 -!- End of /WHO list
14:20 <chromatic> The first part, not the second.
14:21 <obra> So, absent any late /joins, I think that may be it for the day for new reports
14:23 <chromatic> Seems like it.
14:24 <obra> Right then. Next time, I send out the cattleprods in advance
14:24 <Nicholas> and use more 'volts';
14:24 <chromatic> use less 'optional';
14:25 <obra> It is, after all, an opensource project. "Everything's optional"
14:26 <chromatic> Alright Nick, there's your patch.
 14:26 <obra> see y'all next week
14:27 <Nicholas> indeed
14:27 <chromatic> Jesse, are you sending out the logs?
14:27 <obra> I will, yes
