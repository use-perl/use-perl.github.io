<p>I'm pleased to announce that we've just accepted a Perl 6 Microgrant proposal from Adriano Ferreira to write a series of articles about Perl 6 operators. Adriano's propsal appears below:<br/><br/>
NAME
    Proposal for a Perl 6 microgrant "A series of micro-articles at ONLamp"<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION
    I plan to write a series of blog entries at ONLamp site (which belongs
    to the O'Reilly Network) on a Perl 6 related subject. The resulting
    articles will also be integrated into Pugs' documentation and licensed
    under the same terms. The theme of the series contemplates brief
    introductions to the myriad of Perl 6 operators to the varied audience
    that reads the site weblogs.<br/><br/>        O'Reilly weblogs
        http://weblogs.oreilly.com/
        ONLamp (blogs show up at the right)
        http://www.onlamp.com/
        ONLamp blogs (another view)
        http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/<br/><br/>    My initial idea is to approach at each micro-article one operator or a
    group of closely related operators providing the reader with some small
    doses of Perl 6 at a light pace. This light pace would be three articles
    per week, ideally at Monday, Wednesday and Friday.<br/><br/>    To enhance the content, each article shall be submitted for review on
    #perl6 on freenode. This feedback may prevent mistakes and result in
    more complete discussions of each operator/feature.<br/><br/>WHO AM I
    I am a long time lurker at the Perl community, writing ocasionally at my
    journal at use.perl, releasing modules at CPAN, and strugling to
    maintain the dual life of a few core modules (namely, Shell, Exporter,
    and very recently Pod::Perldoc).<br/><br/>        http://use.perl.org/user/ferreira/
        http://search.cpan.org/user/ferreira/<br/><br/>    By the end of 2005, I have shared with David Landgren the fun of writing
    perl5-porters summaries (but I had to stop for a lack of tuits). Eh, I
    missed those times.<br/><br/>        Some samples:
        http://dev.perl.org/perl5/list-summaries/2005/20050915.html
        http://dev.perl.org/perl5/list-summaries/2005/20050926.html
        http://dev.perl.org/perl5/list-summaries/2005/20051226.html<br/><br/>    I am currently not well versed at the Perl 6 development, but I believe
    I have what takes to accomplish the simple task proposed in this grant.
    It is a chance for me to take a closer look at the current state of the
    Perl 6 art and make something useful at same time for the sake of
    broadcasting what Perl 6 would look like and mean to developers all
    around. Of course, in a very humble scale.<br/><br/>    I am an (obscure) ONLamp blogger since May 2007.<br/><br/>        http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/3044
        (See the BLOG handle.)<br/><br/>WHEN IT WILL BE DONE
    Well, Perl 6 has many many operators. Some of them are brand new and
    deserve more attention. Others are well known and standard and could be
    discussed in a batch. Anyway they are many.<br/><br/>    From the table in Synopsis 3<br/><br/>        http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/3044<br/><br/>    I estimate more than 30 articles (which would take more than 10 weeks
    when publishing 3 per week).<br/><br/>    Well, that does not sound convincing. I have to think harder and maybe
    stand on a compromise on 8 weeks or 24 articles. Suggestions for
    defining sharper boundaries to these task welcome.<br/><br/>PREVIOUS DISCUSSION
    The idea occurred to me only recently. FlÃÂ¡vio Glock agreed it could be
    desirable. And so I submitted this.<br/><br/>BLOGGING ABOUT PROGRESS
    The progress can measured by the very publishing of the articles on the
    site. If preferred, I may report this on my use.perl journal as well.<br/><br/>A SAMPLE
    I prepared a first sample of the contents of the first articles on the
    series and put them online in a private site.<br/><br/>        http://ferreira.nfshost.com/perl6/proposal.txt
        http://ferreira.nfshost.com/perl6/intro.html
        http://ferreira.nfshost.com/perl6/zip.html
        http://ferreira.nfshost.com/perl6/stitching.html<br/><br/>PREREQUISITES
    *   I've got the thumbs-up of James Turner, the ONLamp editor
        (http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/2978) as an O'Reilly
        representative to use ONLamp.<br/><br/></p>
