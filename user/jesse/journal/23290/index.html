<h1>Me and Perl 6</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/jesse/">jesse</a> on 2005-02-21T17:39:05</h2>
</div> <!-- /span4 -->


<div class="span8">
<p><p>    My company, <a href="http://www.bestpractical.com">Best Practical Solutions</a>, just donated to the Perl
Foundation's Perl Development Fund. We've never donated directly to
TPF before, but the <a href="http://use.perl.org/news/05/02/14/1523219.shtml?tid=37&tid=42">firestorm</a> around 
this year's perl
grant proposals really bothered me.</p>

    
<p>There's a public perception that there's pretty good visibility into
the Perl 6 development process. Based on this perception, "everybody
knows" that parrot and Perl 6 are academic research projects that won't
ever be completed...and even if they are, that they won't be useful for
solving real world problems.  I've been as guilty of it as the next guy.
I've been frustrated that there seems to be a shadowy group of developers
and designers who are being paid to operate in secret, producing what was 
supposed to be "the community's rewrite of perl."</p>

<p>    I haven't been involved in the development of Perl 6 and parrot, though
I know some of the folks involved in the projects socially.   This much
is obvious to me: most of what we know about what's going on with perl
development is wrong.
</p>

 <p>As I read the rants about the Perl 6 development process on use.perl
early this week, I was really quite upset, because while I didn't agree
with how the trolls presented their rants, I could see myself raising the
same issues.  "You want another four hundred thousand dollars to make Perl 6
available? But I've already given you..." nothing. That's how much I'd
donated to The Perl Foundation to help make Perl 6 happen.  Well,
that's fixable.</p>

  <p>And then I read the <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/gc/grants/2005-p6-proposal.html">grant proposal</a
>.  The first
thing I saw cheered me up immensely: the grant's funding is divided into
12 separate milestones. And, unlike previous "big" perl development
grants, the grant is for _deliverables_, not just to support the
developers while do their thing. Not everything was so rosy, though.
"We get two paragraphs to describe each thirty-five thousand dollar
commitment? I sure wish I could get my customers to agree to a spec
that vague. I don't even understand what I'm really getting for these
milestones. Will Perl 6 run on Mac OS X? Will it run on Solaris? Will it
run on my mobile phone? What if it's not fast enough to run at all? Who
decides if something even works?"  And _that's_ about when I realized
that I don't get to complain about Perl 6 unless I start doing something
to fix the problems I see.</p>

   <p> So I dropped a line to Allison Randal, the Perl 6 project manager,
offering to help out.  I'm going to be taking a stab at being the project's
"junior project manager, in charge of communicating what's getting
done and what's needs more work."  So, in three months, if you can't tell
where the perl6 development process is, I'm the one you should be pointing
your finger at.
</p>

<p>    I'm putting my money on Perl 6.  $5000 of it.  And I'm going to make
damn sure I get my money's worth by volunteering to help make the
development process more transparent and accessible.   Some incredibly
talented people have spent the last five years setting the stage for
what really will be a revolutionary reinvention of perl. It's time to
step up and join them.
</p></p>

<h2>kudos to you</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/zatoichi/">zatoichi</a> on 2005-02-21T19:55:29</h3>
I look forward to reading about what is happening to Perl6.



<h2>good show</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2005-02-21T19:59:33</h3>
I'd like to get our company to put some money in. After all most of our development is perl based and we'll be needing perl 6 eventually and even if we never need it we'll be able to take advantage of the  parrot VM, etc.
<p>
I'd like to get involved too but I have little time and so far my attempts at contacting people about starting things like a perl knowledgebase or application database, or revamping the main perl websites have had no results.
</p><p>
It would be really cool if I knew a) who to contact and b) what jobs needed doing and how much time/money was outstanding.
</p><p>
I'm also interested in things like getting some backing/support from the OSDL, I haven't seen any mention of any support from the OSDL for perl and thats a sore shame.
</p><p>
On top of that it would be cool to have a group of people outreaching to students and lecturers at universities and colleges teaching software development and computing.
</p><p>
Except with all of this its difficult to see where to start, who has done what already and what they acheived.

i agree with you 100%.<br/><br/>a lot of projects need help from volunteer and yet they don't specify what help they need.<br/><br/>btw, jesse++ , cheers all the way from perlchina<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>That's how open source works...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cbrandtbuffalo/">cbrandtbuffalo</a> on 2005-02-21T21:28:11</h3>
Thanks for sharing your conclusions, and your thought process. I think many people have had some of the same thoughts, but not come to the final conclusion that the first step is theirs.

<p>Getting the word out has been a problem and I think the project needed exactly what you're offering to provide. I too look forward to hearing more about what is going on and with you stepping up to help, the key people don't need to stop working to publish results.</p>



<h2>Speaking for myself</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mdxi/">mdxi</a> on 2005-02-22T08:11:39</h3>
...the biggest problem with perl6 is that no one even knows what the hell it is. The existing design documents, with their appropriately religious naming scheme, are as transparent as a mud-smeared concrete wall. Nothing intelligible ever comes from whoever is working on it; no news, no updates, and certainly nothing along the lines of "here's what you can actually *do* with this...". It all reads like marketing gwana-gwana for a compiler design class.<br> <br>Everyone I know has basically given up on perl6, don't even try to understand it anymore (taxonomy of mythical creatures, anyone?), and are just looking forward to perl5.10.

And what does perl 5.10 have that you want?
