<p>I'm doing some work on a large body of code which lacks an automated test suite (<a href="http://mkdoc.com/">MKDoc</a>).  My job at the moment isn't to add automated tests to the code, although I hope to take a crack at that in the near future.  I figured I'd just wing it like I used to in the bad old days.  How bad could it be?
<p>
However, I didn't realize just how strong my addiction to tests had become!  After a few hours of coding I couldn't keep going.  The code felt wrong.  I couldn't see any problems but I knew they must be there.   I hadn't proved the code worked, so why would it?  I started getting paranoid and my code got more and more defensive.   Clearly this wasn't going to work. 
<p>
So I broke down, added a t/ directory with a single test file and started back into test-driven development.  The newish prove command made this particularly easy since I didn't need to add a Makefile, just:
<pre>$ prove t</pre>
<p>
Ah, much better now!

<h2>prove!</h2>

somehow in all the press of things to study I somehow missed out reading about 'prove'. Thanks, I needed that!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D

Maybe I should distribute it with Test::Harness!</p>

<h2>Same experience</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cbrandtbuffalo/">cbrandtbuffalo</a> on 2004-10-18T15:35:10</h3>
I had the same experience recently. I was working on a web app that we were told needed to be done very quickly. I figured I didn't have time for automated tests, so I was back to refreshing in the browser.<br> <br>What a nightmare! After about half a day, I was back writing tests again and I finally got productive. It truly is a myth that automated tests take more time.



<h2>MKDoc?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/perrin/">perrin</a> on 2004-10-18T15:48:05</h3>
What are you using it for?  I can't quite tell what it offers by looking at the website.  Are you doing something hat requires internationalized text?

I'm actually doing development *on* MKDoc, rather than with it.  They lost their lead developer a couple months ago and I answered the call.
<p>
As to what MKDoc offers, I'm not entirely up-to-speed.  It's a dynamic application platform, which makes it a very different kind of content-management system than Krang or Bricolage.  It supports a lot of front-end interactivity that's hard to do with a static publisher: personalization, forums, polls, search, etc.  There's also a lot of emphasis on accessability and internationalization but I haven't gotten into that aspect much yet.
</p><p>
Internally it's an interesting system.  The documentation is lacking and there are no automated tests, but the code is uniformly high-quality.  I'm learning Petal as a result and I have to agree with your assessment, it's good stuff.  Nothing I'd trust a typical web designer around, but a good tool for a programmer hacking HTML.
