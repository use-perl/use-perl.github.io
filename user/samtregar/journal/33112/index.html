<p><p>
In short, <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/jaerlang/">fantastic book</a>, absolutely recommended to any progammer interested in learning about a fascinating and very novel progamming language.  It's very well written and I was engaged from start to finish.
<p>
I think it may be of particular interest to Perl programmers because Erlang offers a great solution to a problem which is very hard to tackle in Perl - reliable, simple paralell processing.  I'm definitely excited to use Erlang in the future - I've already got ideas for more projects than I could possibly find time to complete.  I think its utility will only grow as processors continue to add more cores.
</p>
<p>
As a side note, I read the book as a beta PDF, which I enjoyed a lot more than I thought I would.  It was very convenient to be able to cut-and-paste code from the book into a running Erlang interpreter to see it work.  I got several updated versions of the book as I was reading, but the changes weren't too disruptive.
</p>
<p>
I may write a longer review, perhaps after I've written a moderate amount of Erlang so I can get a sense for what was left out.  But don't wait for that - buy it now and thank me later!

<h2>Longer version</h2>

I looked at a couple of beta chapters and it looked interesting. A longer review would be nice to read.
