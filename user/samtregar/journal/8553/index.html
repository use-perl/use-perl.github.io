<h1>Window Managin'</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>Today I read <a href=http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/581/>an article on freshmeat</a> about an X window manager called <a href=http://ratpoison.sourceforge.net/>ratpoison</a>, designed to behave like GNU Screen</a>.  It has no graphical presense at all.  Every window is maximized and all the window manager controls are on the keyboard and work just like screen.  It's a compelling concept, particularly for someone like myself that first experienced the joys of multi-tasking through screen.
<p>
However, I won't be switching to ratpoison anytime soon.  I've been using X windows long enough that I can't do without mutliple workspaces.  And a toolbar with icons for the programs I use frequently is really essential.  Also, ratpoison is so radically different from most X windowmanagers that some programs are practically useless.  <a href=http://kgs.kiseido.com>Cgoban</a> for example, uses multiple windows and would be a real pain to use in ratpoison.
<p>
However, that doesn't mean I can't get anything out of the article.  I was inspired to take another pass at my custom <a href=http://sawmill.sourceforge.net/>Sawfish</a> config.  I added many more keybindings, allowing me to traverse my workspaces, launch applications and kill without leaving the keyboard.  That combined with more use of maximized windows should confer much of the benefits (to me) of ratpoison, without rendering some apps unusable.

<h2>Switched!</h2>

I read your entry earlier today. I'd heard about ratpoison previously, but this time I thought "my work machine is ideal for that".<br> <br>My work machine is a p130, with 80Mb of RAM, no sound card, no CD drive, a 17" monitor, the video card's also not that great.<br> <br>Normally I use it with two virtual screenfuls. One with Mozilla, so that I can test that things look right. One with a full size xterm, running screen.<br> <br>ratpoison lets me effectively have vertical split in 'screen', which is great. It also lets me change one side to being mozilla as needed (usually I use w3m except when checking the look of things).<br> <br>So, bye bye fvwm. Hello ratpoison.<br> <br>It's not perfect: I would like to be able to have my split screen and just flip to a non-split screen for Mozilla. No doubt if I fiddle with the config I can fake that somehow. But otherwise, it's great (and I even get to leave its metakey alone since I never use ctrl-t =) ).<br> <br>My home machine, somewhat more powerful, won't be switched though. I'd not be able to cope =)
