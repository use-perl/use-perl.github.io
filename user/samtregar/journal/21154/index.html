<p>An article I wrote about my experience with SOAP is up on Perl.com:
<p>
<a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/09/30/drop_the_soap.html">Don't Be Afraid to Drop the SOAP</a>
<p>
So far I've received just one response, an email accusing me of spreading "SOAP FUD."  Hilarious as the idea is, I'd like to clarify that I don't hate SOAP; in fact I'm sure I'll use it again.  I just won't use it if the system needs to operate on large amounts of data within a short amount of time!

from reading the article I don't think you needed SOAP. All the overheads, etc are only worth it if you actually need the extra features it adds over XML/RPC.
<p>
I'd like to see a really cut-down SOAP implementation (possibly based on axis or other c/c++ libraries out there) that is fast enough for use in large applications as SOAP::Lite comes with too much baggage. Who actually uses SOAP over email anyway?

I looked at XML/RPC when I designed the Bricolage SOAP interface.  Two things stick out in my memory: lack of undef support and a weak error handling system.  Maybe those weren't deal-breakers, but they seemed problematic in this case.  Bricolage actually uses IDs of 0 for valid objects and has a rather elaborate exception system which I wanted to map in the RPC interface.
<p>
Looking back I think my biggest mistake wasn't in choosing SOAP for the RPC layer, it was in choosing an RPC layer to start with!
