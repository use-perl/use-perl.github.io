<p>I've finally gotten my hands dirty with <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmlvs/">XML::Validator::Schema</a>.  I'm using it as a test case to try out Test Driven Development, as I learned it from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321146530/102-8589669-6769714">Test Driven Development: By Example</a>.
<p>
So far it's been a mind-bending trip.  If you don't know, TDD is about writing tests first, coding <i>just enough</i> to make all the tests pass and then refactoring to reduce duplication.     The result is hopefully lean, well-tested code with less risk of failure and less wasted effort.
<p>
I'm utterly surprised by just how much refactoring I've been doing.  I've added sub-modules, removed them and added them back.  I've removed more methods than I've written.  As each test case goes in the entire architecture of the module comes up for review.  It's a refreshing process, and the results so far are pretty good.  XML::Validator::Schema is probably 30% of the way to replacing Xerces/C++ on my latest project, after only 3 days of development.
<p>
In some ways this is the ideal TDD project because I have no idea what the architecture of an XML Schema validator should look like.  As I add new test cases I can evolve the design to handle the added complexity.  And with a standardized file format like XML Schema I've got a wealth of potential test cases at my fingertips and little opportunity to write bad tests.
<p>
The only downside I've found so far is that I'm not writing very much developer-focused documentation.  Knowing that the code will likely change radically very soon puts a damper on writing baroque descriptions of how things work.  I guess I'll find out how much of a problem this is when I get to maintain the code later...
