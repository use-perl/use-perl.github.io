<p>I just put the first entry in <a href="http://blogs.apress.com/authors.php?author=Sam%20Tregar">my new blog</a> at <a href="http://apress.com">Apress</a>.  I'll keep posting here on Perl-specific topics, but more general techno-babble will go there.

My first entry concerns my plans for a wireless X11 tablet:

<p>I had a "corridor" type conversionation with someone once about a tablet form device with a stripped down feature set optimised to displaying X over a wireless link once. Touch sensitive screen, nice graphics card, low-temperature CPU, lots of RAM, probably no disks, and OS and X software in flash RAM.</p>

I thought about the "no disks" option too, but it doesn't seem to be possible with cheap hardware.  As far as I can tell there aren't any PCMCIA wireless cards that can do a netboot and flash RAM would require a custom device.

<p>Quite, but I was dreaming of a properly manufactured device, prupose built for the job, rather than a DIY affair. I'm sure some variant of an ARM, SPARC, or MIPS processor, RAM and a minimal OS would be sufficient. Most of the work would be in the X optimised GPU, and there would be pretty much little else going on, so battery life should be good. You could probably run two or three devices at a time from the same backend server, ideal for the wireless Unix user of the future. At a push you could probably run a VNC connection to one of those old Windows things too!</p>

What about netbooting via ethernet... and then cutting the "umbilical cord"?<br> <br>Hm...<br> <br>

Again, no netboot PCMCIA support.  That's as true for wired as for wireless, as far as I know.
