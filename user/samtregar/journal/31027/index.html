<h1>Safely timeout DBI with DBIx::Timeout</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>Recently I needed to find a way to timeout a DBI request.  I found the state of the art less than satisfying, involving unsafe signals and a chance of memory corruption deep in Perl's guts:
<p>
<blockquote><a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/timb/DBI/DBI.pm#Signal_Handling_and_Canceling_Operations">http://search.cpan.org/user/timb/DBI/DBI.pm#Signal_Handling_and_Canceling_Operations</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
This led me to create <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/samtregar/DBIx-Timeout/">DBIx::Timeout</a> which instead of using unsafe signals:
<p>
<pre>
  - Forks a child process which sleeps for $timeout seconds.

  - Runs your long-running query in the parent process.

  - If the parent process finishes first it kills the child and
    returns.

  - If the child process wakes up it kills the parent's DB thread and
    exits with a code so the parent knows it was timed out.
</pre>
<p>
Tim Bunce suggested a possible optimization - fork just one child process and have it watch any number of slow queries simultaneously.  It would accept assignments via a pipe interface.  Seems like a good idea, although it's likely overkill for my usage.  The queries I need to timeout are very likely to be long-running, and when they're not don't need to be very fast.  The overhead of forking a process that exits almost immediately won't cause any problems, I'm betting.
<p>
So, please give it a try!  And if you're not a MySQL user, please port it to your DB and send me a patch.  It should be an easy job - all you have to do is implement a call to kill another process in the DB (MySQL does it with "KILL $thread_id").  (<b>UPDATE:</b> actually, it's a little more work - you also need to write new tests.  The tests I wrote for MySQL use GET_LOCK() to test timeouts - you'll need to do something analgous for your DB.)
<p>

<p>
PS: I should note that the mechanism this module uses was suggested by my co-worker <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/perrin">Perrin Harkins</a>.  I'll add that to the module's POD for the next release.</p>
