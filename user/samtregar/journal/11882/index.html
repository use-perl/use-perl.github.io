<p>If you've never seen <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0036855">Gaslight</a>, go see it.  If you can't drop everything to see a fantastic film right now, suffice it to say that Gaslight is about driving someone mad in very subtle ways.
<p>
Redhat 9 and Apache 2 just did the trick.
<p>
I'm working on a little CGI to produce pretty HTML diffs between module versions.  Someday it might be part of search.cpan.org, but for now it's just a gleam in my eye.
<P>
Anyway, I decide the best way to test it is to get Apache setup to execute CGIs out of ~/public_html on my brand new Redhat 9 installation.  I open up httpd.conf and do the obvious - uncomment the AddHandler for .cgi, setup userdirs with ExecCGI, make sure permissions are all setup right and start up Apache.  Hit the CGI and wham, I get a 500 error and this in the error_log:
<p>
<pre>[Fri Apr 18 01:11:25 2003] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] Premature end of script headers: example.cgi</pre>
<p>
I double, triple, quadruple check everything. At this point example.cgi is just a single 'print' with perfect headers.  I run it as the Apache user and it works fine.  But from a browser, I get nothing but 500s.
<p>
An hour later I find myself searching the web for "Premature end of script headers".  I've been developing CGIs with Apache for almost 5 years now.  At this point I am totally mad.
<p>
Finally it dawns on me.  Maybe there are new logs in Apache 2!  And there it was, in suexec.log of all the damn places:
<p>
<pre>[2003-04-18 01:14:32]: uid: (500/sam) gid: (501/501) cmd: example.cgi
[2003-04-18 01:14:32]: directory is writable by others: (/home/sam/public_html)</pre>
<p>
That's a problem!?  And how did suexec get turned on?  I look through the conf file which I've already read line-by-line.  There's nothing in there about suexec!  I hit the Apache docs and find this lie:
<p>
<pre>
If Apache finds a properly configured suEXEC wrapper, it will print the following message to the error log:

[notice] suEXEC mechanism enabled (wrapper: /path/to/suexec) 
</pre>
<p>
I can tell you with 100% certainty that no such line is in my error_log.  To make matters worse, turning on suexec is a matter of removing the suexec binary from the path, not making a change to the conf file!  Check it:
<p>
<pre>
If you want to disable suEXEC you should kill and restart Apache after you have removed the "suexec" file.
</pre>
<p>
Holy crap!  I have to delete /usr/sbin/suxec in order to turn off suexec in Apache?
<p>
So I did it.
<p>
And everything started working nornally.
<p>
And I'm totally insane now.
