<p>Never violate this rule:
<p>
<blockquote>Return unto others what you wish them to pass to you.</blockquote>
<p>
Or, in code, for every object <code>$foo</code> and every valid pair of <code>get_bar()</code> and <code>set_bar()</code>, this must work:
<p>
<blockquote><code>$foo->set_bar($foo->get_bar());</code></blockquote>
<p>
Violate this, particularly in an update to an existing system, and you will truely have hell to pay.  This happened in a system I'm working on and by my count I'm fixing the fifth bug associated with it over a span of two months!

<p>Assuming you're talking about code I wrote (and a bug I just fixed in Bricolage), I think I would design it differently today than I did a couple years ago when I wrote it, though I'm not sure how. I'll have to think about it...</p>

Yes, the motivation for this revelation was your code, and the bugs that followed (and continue to follow; I'm working on one right now).  However, I didn't write this just to tweak your nose.  I feel like I'm onto something here...  A fundamental rule of OO design, perhaps, or at least a very useful lesson.

<p>I didn't think you were tweaking my nose, and I agree that what you're &quot;onto&quot; is indeed an excellent guiding principal. Here's another that I'll follow in other future projects: Never, <i>ever</i> use 0 (that's a zero) as an object identifier.</p>

<h2>My golden rule of simple mutators:</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pdcawley/">pdcawley</a> on 2002-11-08T07:40:53</h3>
Simple mutators <code>set_foo</code> shall return the object mutated, they shall <em>not</em> return the new value, you already knew that. They shall not return the old value, if you wanted to know that you should have asked. If a simple mutator fails, it shall throw an exception. <br> <br>Actually, in general, and unless there's a bloody good reason for returning something else, methods should always return <code>$self</code> or throw an exception.<br> <br>Why?<blockquote><div> <tt>my $thing = Class-&gt;new-&gt;set_foo(...)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt;set_bar(...)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt;set_baz(...)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt;verify_object;</tt> </div></blockquote>Clean, clear, extensible. I've been coding in this style for the best part of a year now, and it's just lovely. Thank you Smalltalk.

<p>Did you mean <strong>mutators</strong> should always return <tt>$self</tt>?  Having an accessor return <tt>$self</tt> would be disappointing.</p>

See the 'bloody good reason' caveat? I think 'accessor methods' come under the caveat. I was trying to emphasise my view that 'return $self' applied to a lot more than just 'set_foo'.
