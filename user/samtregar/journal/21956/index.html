<div class="span8">
<p>I found myself in a Barnes and Noble store this weekend, and of course I had to browse the Perl shelf.  Alas, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=6920f5SAH3&isbn=159059018X&itm=2">my book</a> is gone.  But I did spot a new one: <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=6920f5SAH3&isbn=0760754225&itm=2">PERL in Easy Steps</a>.  It's on Barnes and Noble's imprint and they're selling it very cheap compared to the competition.
<p>
Now, I didn't read the whole thing, but I did notice a few striking features.  First, the author doesn't know a thing about the name "Perl".  He insists on capitalizing it throughout the book (ex. PERL) and  claims in the first paragraph that it stands for "Practical Enquiry and Reporting Language."  Now we all know that Perl isn't really acronym, but even when it <i>is</i> it's Extraction, not Enquiry!
<p>
Second, the author doesn't seem to understand the distinction between Perl and CGI.  The inside flap lists variables that can be used in Perl, but it's really a list of a few CGI environment variables.    Of course that list is completely useless if you're doing things right and using CGI.pm!
<p>
As a final note, the book includes no author information that I could find.  I looked in the front, in the back and on both covers.  Aside from  the name, Mike McGrath, I couldn't find anything else about him.  Is he a Perl programmer?  I doubt it!
<p>
So that's what you get for $9.  Oh well.

Possibly there is no such person. Mike McGrath could be a "house name" for this series, with each written "for hire" by a different nameless hack. The lack of Author Info is suggestive.

<h2>Perl Book Litmus Test</h2>

If you get a chance run it through <a href="http://www.pobox.com/user/schwern/litmus_test/index.html" title="pobox.com">the Perl Book Litmus Test</a pobox.com> and let me know what happens.  It would be funny if that was still useful five years later.

I went by the bookstore on my lunchbreak and ran the test:
<p><ul>
<li>localtime: PASS</li>
<li>open() or die: PASS, although the description is very brief and the only example shown is open().  All the other examples have no error checking.</li>
<li>srand: PASS, no mention</li>
<li>array size: PASS</li>
<li>flock: PASS, although many examples that should use it don't, like the example counter script.</li>
<li>portable constants: FAIL.  The examples of flock() pass raw numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Overall a pretty decent result for a pretty bad book!  I think the litmus test could use some updating.  XML parsed with regexes, CGI parameter parsing without modules, failing to mention CPAN at least 10 times, etc.

"Do as I say, don't do as I do" is bad in a tech learning book.</p><blockquote><div> <tt>I think the litmus test could use some updating.

But its still amusing that the old tests continue to catch crappy books.</p>

Have you considered sending a technical review to the publishers and the author? I've found that people have be surprisingly amenable to that approach.

For what purpose?  I'm sure the problems I noticed are just the tip of the iceberg.  Besides, I like to get paid to do tech reviews on comercial products!  I reserve my free work is for open source projects only.

Well, largely because if no-one tells them that they are publishing bad books then they'll continue to publish bad books and people will continue to buy them.<br> <br>Of course, it's possible that they already know they're publishing bad books, but they don't care<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
