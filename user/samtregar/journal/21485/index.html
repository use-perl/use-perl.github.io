<p>So I'm working on <a href="http://mkdoc.org">MKDoc</a> and of course it comes with it's own system for avoiding SQL, this one dubbed simply "lib::sql".  Now, I'm no big fan of OO DB wrappers, but the rest of the MKDoc code is quite well conceived, I thought this might be worth its (large) weight in code.
<p>
Nope.  It doesn't even handle a simple two-table join!  It's based on the idea that every object will map to exactly one table and that every query will address only that table.  Sigh.

<h2>objects spanning tables</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2004-11-05T10:20:44</h3>
I was taking to DrHyde about this at l.pm last night. I am hoping I may be able to acheive this with Class::PINT. It already provides complex/compound attributes on top of CDBI (via subclassing) as well as inheritance.
<p>
Once I have released at tested what I have done so far I plan to emable objects to span tables/joins in a nice way.
</p><p>
All I really need are some good test cases and suggestions for how you would expect the API to work.

Why bother?  SQL works fine and it's not hard to write once you get used to it.  Frankly I find most DBI wrappers to be more trouble than they're worth.  They make easy things moderately easier and the hard stuff is just as hard if not harder!

writing SQL over and over tends to lead to more bugs and poor optimsiation as well as a maintainance nightmare.
<p>
If your application is object oriented there are several gains from using a OOPF (object oriented persistance framework) such as pre-canned accessors/mutators, persistance, caching, searching and retrieving, much less code to write.
</p><p>
A well designed OOPF stays out of your way and doesn't require your database to become an inpenetrable mess, Class::DBI works nicely with any well structured schema.
</p><p>
Class::PINT enables me to write quite complex classes with a handful of lines both in the class and any code using it.
</p><p>
The value in this is significant when building non-trivial applications with more than a handful of classes.
</p><p>
Some OOPF can get in the way, but a good one should be fairly transparent, and easy to bypass or customise, Class::DBI, on which I have build Class::PINT is just that.
