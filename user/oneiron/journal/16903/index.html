<p><P>I have been feeling very sad about Spoon for some days now.
I've been a quiet admirer of his work and was looking forward
to seeing much more because he was definitely a rising star.
He contributed in a number of areas that I am also keenly interested
in: perl-qa, Phalanx, CPANTS, WWW::Mechanize, Perl books, ... but
I never had the chance to meet him. So I was looking forward to
meeting him at YAPC::Australia in Melbourne in November.</P><br/><br/><P>The first ever YAPC::Australia is yet to be announced and may
not happen this year, but it has certainly been discussed on the
Melbourne.PM mailing list. If it does go ahead, Spoon will be
sorely missed, as I'm sure he would have given several excellent
talks there. I think it would be wonderful to see someone give a
YAPC talk describing Spoon's contributions to the Perl community
during his (too short) lifetime.</P><br/><br/></p>

<h2>YAPC::AU is happening</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jarich/">jarich</a> on 2004-05-17T03:51:49</h3>
Yep, YAPC::AU is definately going ahead.  Scheduled for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd of December 2004.
<p>
With luck the CFP will be out by the end of this week.
</p><p>
We're renaming the conference to be the Open Source Developement Conference, because Australia doesn't have one and the Python/OzZope, Php and other groups wanted to join us.
</p><p>
We should have content appearing at <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/" title="osdc.com.au">http://www.osdc.com.au</a osdc.com.au> really really soon now.
</p><p>
See you there!</p>
