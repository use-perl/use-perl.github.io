<p><P>Due to an unfortunate mixup, Sydney.pm missed holidaying New York
Perl Monger Ross Lonstein by 24 hours, the fleet-footed New Yorker
already on the road to Melbourne. Only two mongers gorged at the
Chinese Noodle restaurant, Shop 7/8 Quay St, Haymarket.
After asking the only non-Chinese eater, "Erm, are you Ross Lonstein
of New York City?", Stephen and I hatched our evil plan for reviving
Sydney.pm over a huge plate of spicy noodles, washed down with a
Starbucks Caramel Macchiato (espresso coffee mixed with caramel
syrup topped with foamed milk and yet more caramel syrup).
Well, we discussed several possibilities, but don't really know
what to do.</P><br/><br/><P>Any tips on reviving a Perl Mongers group?
I heard Gabor gave a talk about the leading Perl Mongers groups
at YAPC::Europe; does anyone have a reference to that talk?
Who are the leading Perl Monger groups and why are they successful?</P>

<h2>Successful PM Groups</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2003-08-12T09:52:14</h3>
<a href="http://www.pm.org/successful/" title="pm.org">This article</a pm.org> might be useful.<br> <br>Gabor's survey seemed to conclusively prove that london.pm was the biggest and the best<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>You can't &quot;force&quot; a group</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2003-08-12T18:29:59</h3>
pdx.pm goes through fits and starts, so I'm familiar with this.  It takes two things to keep a group going... a leader that will do it, and a regular meeting, even if it's just a social meeting, although it helps to have meetings with speakers, even on the smallest of topics ("things you can do with a hash!").



<h2>Melbourne PM</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jarich/">jarich</a> on 2004-07-14T13:50:13</h3>
Melbourne PM is active and happy.  It went very very quiet after Skud left and then we (pjf, me and Scott) decided to bring some life back into it.
<p>
My suggestions on bringing Sydney PM back to life are:
</p><ul>
   <li>Start off with a social gathering for the first meeting - like going to a movie or cafe</li>
   <li>Find somewhere to host the meeting that you can rely on for a while (contact me for a suggestion)</li>
   <li>Update the website</li>
   <li>Enthuse on the list for the whole month between the social gathering and the first official meeting about the first official meeting</li>
   <li>Make sure you get promises from at least 5 people that they'll be at that meeting</li>
   <li>Come up with a barrage of your own talks and try to get those 5 people to have some as well.</li>
   <li>Run meeting with a bunch of talks (about 90 minutes worth) and then go to a restaurant/pub somewhere quietish for dinner afterwards.</li>
   <li>Invite Damian to visit for a talk (for a later meeting).  You could be lucky.</li>
   <li>Soldier on.  You and whoever you restart this with will probably do more talks than everyone else.  Try to secure talks for next month before the end of the current month's meeting.</li>
</ul>
Well it worked for Melbourne PM, it could work for you.
