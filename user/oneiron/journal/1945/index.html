<p><P>I recently joined the ranks of CPAN authors, but have only
written one module, namely <TT>Acme::EyeDrops</TT>.
I have not received much feedback on it and only one bug report,
making me curious to see if anyone was actually using it.
Searching with good old google revealed, to my great surprise,
that it is being taught at Harvard University!
Well, I don't really know what
<A href="http://practicalperl.com/">practicalperl.com</A>
is -- part of <I>Harvard Extension School</I>, whatever that means.
Anyway, here is their homework assignment.</P><br/><br/><P><B>Homework 2 problem 5</B></P><br/><br/><P><TT>
Just follow the instructions...<BR>
You will install Acme::Eyedrops.<BR>
<BR>
You will write a program, eyedrops.pl, that uses Acme::Eyedrops<BR>
to convert a program into a prettier version of a program.<BR>
<BR>
$ ./eyedrops.pl hello.pl > hello_world_eyedropped.pl<BR>
1 shapes completed.<BR>
$ perl hello_world_eyedropped.pl<BR>
Hello world!<BR>
</TT></P><br/><br/><P>Interestingly, the lecturer manually added <TT>use strict</TT> to
the top of an EyeDrop'ed program, and, shock, horror, it worked!
It never occurred to me to test EyeDrops under <TT>use strict</TT>. :)</P><br/><br/><P>Oh, and it got a mention at Purdue University too, in a talk
by Dave Jacoby titled <I>The Joy of Perl</I> in an unfortunately
titled section: <I>Programmers on Crack</I>. But since it is mentioned
in the same breath as the maestro's <TT>Acme::Bleach</TT> and <TT>Coy</TT>,
I will forgive the author for the unfortunate section name. :)</P>

<h2>Feedback on one's modules</h2>

One just never knows.
<br>I've written <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=author&amp;query=SBURKE" title="cpan.org">rather a lot of modules</a cpan.org> and probably don't get more than three messages a month about all of them put together.  And it's my impression that some are seeing very heavy use, like HTML::TreeBuilder.  I think I get more mail about the MIDI modules than anything else.

I get most of my mail about <a href="http://sf.net/projects/mp3-info/" title="sf.net">MP3::Info</a sf.net>.
<br>
<br>Feedback depends on lots of things.  If your module is well-documented and easy to use and mostly bug-free, you probably won't get much feedback, except for the occasional "thank you," unless your module is well-used enough that the "masses" get ahold of it.  Most of the MP3::Info mail I get is from people who don't know how to install modules, can't read docs, etc.  My other modules aren't as sexy and don't get into the hands of people who can't read.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

<h2>Choosy Coders use strict;</h2>

<i>Interestingly, the lecturer manually added use strict to the top of an EyeDrop'ed program, and, shock, horror, it worked! It never occurred to me to test EyeDrops under use strict.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</i> <p>
Not to start THAT holy war again, but I can't fathom coding without strict. I just checked a quick script I wrote at work this week which consisted of six lines of code, and was intended to be used once and only once. The seventh line, up top, was...</p><p>
use strict;</p><p>
In the end, to each his own, I guess.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<h2>Re:Choosy Coders use strict;</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/oneiron/">oneiron</a> on 2002-01-07T05:33:07</h3>
<p>I strongly believe in use strict.
The purpose of Acme::EyeDrops, however,
is to remove all alphanumerics from your
program, shaping it like a camel, say.
Manually adding "use strict" (9 alphanumerics)
after EyeDrops-converting your program
seems to defeat this primary purpose.</p>

I meant "Programmers on Crack" in the nicest of all possible ways....
