<p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/juanbro/journal/8054">Previously</a> I wrote about not having any friends, fans, foes or freaks (try saying that three times fast). As I looked around I noticed that most people have friends and fans, but *nobody* had any foes or freaks. What a warm, fuzzy, perlish kind of feeling...ahhhh...Wait a minute! What gives? I mean what would somebody have to *do* around here to have a Foe?! Besides, I didn't realize we were allowed to <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/gnat/journal/8057">ridicule</a> people. I bet if Steve Ballmer was around here there'd be some Foes.<br/><br/>Now I know this may be a childish re-hash for some, but as long as I am pouting about not going to the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/macosx2002/">Mac OS X Conference</a>, I may as well do something infantile. Besides, I hadn't seen this in a while, and it *is* 'snort your Kool-aid thru your nostrils' kind of funny. Unfortunately it is kind of a large file for the broadband impaired (3mb) but worth a modem workout.<br/><br/>Oh, and, uhh...you may want to ask small children and the squeamish to leave the room before viewing this.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.broscom.com/bandwidth/dancemonkeyboy.mpg">dancemonkeyboy</a>  (3mb)<br/><br/>And what does this have to do with Perl?<br/><br/>Absolutely nothing. (Thank God.) Could you imagine Larry...never mind.<br/><br/>Well *that* ought to generate some foe-dom. Hmmm...but if I don't have any friends or fans to read my journal...this is vicious.</p>
