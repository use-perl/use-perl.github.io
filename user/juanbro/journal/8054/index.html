<p>Ah-hem...my first use.perl journal entry. What should I write about? (...he asks as if someone will actually read this)<br/><br/>How about this journal business itself? It's all very disturbing for the newcomer. First of all, I apparently have absolutely no friends in the entire world. And no fans either. I suppose the only consolation is that I have apparently not made any foes yet; nor have I encountered any freaks. Glad about that.<br/><br/>So how do I make friends anyhow? I mean, it's not like I can bribe people by packing extra twinkies in my lunch bag everyday, right? Hmmmm...perl? Perl. PERL!! Yes! I'll write about Perl! Everybody *loves* Perl! ...wait...daag. I'm no good at writing about Perl. (hell, I'm not even very good at writing *in* Perl) Maybe I should just post some cute pictures of my <a href="http://www.broscom.com/twins/">twins</a>. Everybody loves babies right? ...well, some do. Besides, this place seems a lot more laid back than monks.<br/><br/>Geeeze. I guess I'll just write about some of the things I *like* about Perl. I like that when I wake up in the morning, I really look forward to writing Perl. I like that (even though I have no friends) there is a real sense of community to Perl; and they are so darn helpful. I like that even a doofus like me can have his own <a href="http://whitemountain.pm.org">pm group</a>. I like that I've been able to vote 46 times for OSX as my desktop of choice.<br/><br/>I think I'll like it here too.<br/><br/>
(...now how do I post this thing?)</p>
