<p>Try as I might, I just can't figure out where the errors are coming from in the calling_conventions branch. My problem was leaving the branch alive for far too long, and a lot of big changes were made in that time. Now, when I try to merge back to trunk, I get some PCT failures that I don't understand. Try as I might, I just can't get enough of PCT into my head at once to figure out where the errors are coming from.<br/><br/>I've been busy with the holidays. I have a lot of family that came in from out of town, so I had to spend time away from the computer to see them. Now, I'm mostly home free till christmas rolls around, so I can get back to work on this.<br/><br/>Tonight I created a branch, call_conv_redux to help with the debugging. I'm going to move over bits and pieces of my work from the calling_conventions branch into the new one, and verify them bit by bit. I'm also going to follow and aggressive merger schedule. I'm hoping to get many of the changes I made fixed and merged into trunk by tomorrow or early next week. I'll post more updates as they come.</p>
