<h1>Perl 6 Microgrant</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>I just received word today from Jesse that my Perl 6 microgrant proposal has been accepted! Here's the post where it's officially announced:<br/><br/><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme/journal/38274">http://use.perl.org/user/acme/journal/38274</a><br/><br/>Now, there was some back-and-forth between myself, Jesse, and Allison prior to the application being accepted and the general consensus is that work on the books in the Parrot repo (docs/book/) and in the pugs repo (docs/tutorial/) should probably be focused on since they are licensed under the Artistic 2.0 (which is compatible with Parrot and Perl 6) and we will want to have these two be publication-ready when Parrot and Rakudo hit 1.0 respectively. <br/><br/>So, pursuant to these desires and the letter of the microgrant, here are the things I will be doing to fulfill this grant:<br/><br/>1) Create a new "Perl 6 Programming" book on Wikibooks. Write lots of content and try to attract some readers/contributors for it. 
2) Help improve <a href="http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/docs/tutorial/">pugs/docs/tutorial/</a> by removing old info, expanding it with new info, incorporating details from the test suite and the synopses and the various implementations, and generally trying to turn it into a publishable book about Perl 6.<br/><br/>Most of the new content I write for one book will be able to be adapted for the other, so there isn't going to be any wasted effort.<br/><br/>In addition to this work for the microgrant, I will be continuing work on:<br/><br/>3) The "<a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Parrot_Virtual_Machine">Parrot Virtual Machine</a>" book on Wikibooks, which I started and having been updating occasionally.
4) The <a href="http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/docs/book/">parrot/docs/book</a>, which I've also been contributing to regularly and have done a lot of updating for in the past few months.<br/><br/>The end result of all this work is that we're going to have lots of documentation that people can go to for answers. Different books will cover the same material in different ways and they will evolve separately. The real winners will be the readers and new learners of Perl 6, because they are going to have a wealth of resources available to learn from. Running a google search for "Learn Perl 6" should turn up lots of informative results!<br/><br/>I will (probably) be using this blog to post updates about this work as I go.</p>
