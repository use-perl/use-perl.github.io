<p>I know I haven't posted much lately, but I've been genuinely busy. Since the last time I posted, I got married which has eaten up a lot of my time. Wikibooks has also been taking up a lot of my "me time", since it's gotten a few new software features such as print-on-demand book publishing. I need some more spit and polish on it, but we could have a printed, published book about Parrot or Perl 6 on Amazon or in Barnes & Nobel well before the 1.0 release. Probably won't happen (especially if we don't get more community involvement in them) any time soon, but it's an interesting thought.<br/><br/>I've been trying to get back into the Parrot saddle after the honeymoon, and the big task on my plate right now is the calling_conventions branch. The goal of this branch (and I think I'm the only person working on it) is to try to unify some of the function and method calling functions, and refactor things to make them smaller and more streamlined. It's a huge task, and I admit there was a moment today when I felt a little bit overwhelmed by it all. But I got a few key changes made and now things don't seem so bad. I'm running into some problems with my current work causing segfaults and other problems, but I'm planning a merge to trunk soon once I get the first changes made and working perfectly.<br/><br/>That's all for now, I'll post updates when I start getting changes committed and merged to trunk.</p>
