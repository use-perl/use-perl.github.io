<p>First day of SOC work was today, and it started off with more of a whimper then a bang. I was away for the weekend and most of today. It turns out it's a holiday today, which I would have known if I ever bothered to look at a calendar. As such, most of the day today was spent with Dana and my family, and I wasn't able to get cracking on Parrot until this evening. I have been able to set up some of the necessary scaffolding already, and that's a good enough start for me.<br/><br/>In my SOC application, I had the following timeline:<br/><br/>* Algorithms laid out, data structures designed, and basic interfaces written by June 1st
* Memory allocation and deallocation functions written. June 5th
* Support for memory arenas implemented. Possibly apply (or begin applying) generational demarcations. June 10th
* Dead Object Detection (DOD) and collection for simple buffers implemented. Possibly implement memory compaction techniques. June 15th
* DOD and collection for objects broken into incremental stages, and implemented. June 20th
* Finishing touches, spit and polish, system integration. June 25th.<br/><br/>This was just the basic timeline, I provided a number of additional details. However, those details aren't important now. The first step is to finalize the details of the algorithm. I was hoping to hook up with chromatic last week and work on these details, but I got too busy and never managed to pull it off. However, I've given myself until June 1st to do this, so I can't cry that I'm not a week ahead of schedule. June 1`st is a sunday and since I'm typically not around on weekends this deadline will probably be pushed forward to Friday May 29th. <br/><br/>After that, I'm scheduled to start working on allocators and deallocators, followed by possibly-generational arenas, and the remainder of the GC in stages. I'm not a stickler for schedules, and a more logical order of work might present itself as things progress. Skeleton allocator/deallocator functions might be a good first step, but after that I don't know where I will turn from there.<br/><br/>Hopefully, most of my daily reports won't be this long. Today is the first day, and so I feel like there is a little bit more to talk about then usual. I have a few more quality hours of work tonight, and then some sleep before what I hope to be a long marathon tomorrow. </p>
