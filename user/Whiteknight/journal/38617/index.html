<p>I haven't been doing much work on Parrot or even the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Perl_6_Programming">Perl 6 book</a> this week, instead focusing most of my efforts on Matrixy. Matrixy, which I introduced in my last post, is an M (Matlab/Octave) compiler for Parrot.<br/><br/>Progress has been going well, and just this morning I got a few more tricky features working. "working" is, of course, open to multiple definitions. This is especially true for such an idiomatic language as M. <br/><br/>I got nargin and nargout mostly working, along with varargin. These are the tools for doing variadic argument lists in M. Implementation isn't perfect still, but at least it's a start. I'm still fighting with lots of issues when it comes to function/variable dispatching. I finally have a fix ready that does what we need it to do, but it relies on the use of lexical variables which terribly breaks interactive mode because of issues with PCT.<br/><br/>Blair has been doing some great work on the libraries, and he's got some NCI stubs in place for interfacing with the BLAS and CLAPACK libraries, and converting our ResizablePMCArray-based matrices into the forms needed for use with these libraries. Linear algebra power is coming to Parrot!<br/><br/>I realize that a lot of people aren't familiar with M, it's a pretty specialized language that's used primarily for engineering modeling and scientific research. Maybe in my next few posts here I'll give a quick tutorial on the language and try to show some of the weird/cool idiosncracies that simultaneously make it an interesting language to work with and a difficult language to write a compiler for.<br/><br/><a href="http://code.google.com/p/matrixy/">Matrixy project page</a></p>
