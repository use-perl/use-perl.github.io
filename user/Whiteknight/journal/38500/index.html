<div class="span8">
<p>Yesterday I made a few misc changes to the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Perl_6_Programming">Perl 6 book at Wikibooks</a>, although nothing as substantial as I would have hoped. My wife hasn't been feeling well and Parrot is preparing for a big release today (the last one before 1.0 next month) so I've been keeping busy with those things and haven't had a lot of time to spare.<br/><br/>Yesterday I did add a few sections about feeds, gather/take, and placeholder arguments. I had intended to start writing about exceptions and then segue into a discussion about control exceptions. However, as I started digging through the synopses I realized that there really weren't any good examples of them in action for me to base my work on.<br/><br/>I know some of the basics about the Perl 6 exceptions implementation, but I don't have a really firm grasp on it just yet. I'm going to have to do some digging to try and find some examples to make sure I'm explaining it right in the book. Once I get exception handling down, I'm going to talk about control exceptions and then the various special named blocks.<br/><br/>That out of the way, I have very few subjects left to write stub drafts for:<br/><br/>1) Grammars and regexes
2) Threading and Concurrency
3) File IO
4) Packages/Modules
5) Perl Culture<br/><br/>With all the information in place, it's just a matter of expanding discussion and adding various code examples to fill the book out. I plan to be concurrently expanding both the book on Wikibooks and the book in the Pugs repo at the same time, since they will both be needing a lot of the same work at that point.<br/><br/>I could really use some good example code, especially code that *should* work and be best-practices Perl 6. Most of the code I can find right now is filled with all sorts of hacks and workarounds because of shortcomings in the various Perl 6 implementations. I have to do some serious digging through the Pugs test suite to get some ideas (I may even help improve/verify some of the tests too, while I'm at it).<br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Perl_6_Programming">Perl 6 book at Wikibooks</a></p>

<h2>File IO will have to wait probably</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Arador/">Arador</a> on 2009-02-17T15:30:18</h3>
IO is currently heavily under discussion on the perl-language mailing list, and the result isn't quite set yet. In general, anything in S16 can still change.<br/><br/>If I were you, I'd wait for the dust to settle, or else you will have a lot more work keeping things up-to-date.
