<p>It's been damn near three weeks since my last post here, which is obnoxious but not entirely my fault. I moved into a new apartment which has been keeping me busy. Work has also been eating up my time, along with my longer commute.<br/><br/>Most of the Parrot work I've been doing in the past three weeks is plain-text: writing function-level documentation for the hundreds of undocumented functions in the Parrot codebase, and writing lots more content for the /docs/book. I'm also starting to do some work now in the new /branches/calling_conventions branch, which hopes to unify a bunch of related functions for calling PIR subroutines from C. We have over a dozen such functions, and my hope is to be able to whittle the number down significantly.<br/><br/>Other then that, I've still got the GC in the back of my mind, and when my schedule settles down a little bit (hopefully in November, after the wedding), I would like to kick development on that back into high gear. I don't know when Allison was planning to work on the GC milestone (MMD was just completed, and IO is next), but I don't think I need to wait for her to get the ball rolling for it.</p>

<h2>heh, commutes</h2>

<p>Oddly, I get MORE done when I have longer commutes, mostly because I take the train and that means lots of 30 minute hacking increments.</p>
