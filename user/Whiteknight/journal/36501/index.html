<p>Today marks the last day of work I have before this year's Google Summer of Code project starts on Monday the 26th. I'm away all weekend, and so I need to get my prep work done now so I can hit the ground running next week. I still need to talk to chromatic a little bit and finalize details of the algorithm to make sure I'm running in the right direction.<br><br><br/><br/>I've been in regular contact with chromatic about this project, and he's been feeding me a list of papers to read about GC. I was hardly an expert before all this, but I'm certainly moving in that direction now! With school over, my access to free printing and free database access has disappeared, so I can only hope I read enough.<br><br><br/><br/>This morning I created a branch in the Parrot svn repository to hold my work. The benefit to having a branch is that I can make all the mistakes I want without affecting the rest of the project. The link to the branch is here:<br><br><br/><br/><a href="https://svn.perl.org/parrot/branches/gsoc_pdd09/">https://svn.perl.org/parrot/branches/gsoc_pdd09/</a>
<br><br><br/><br/>A few weeks ago, I switched from Windows to Linux, and it's been hectic for me to become familiar with all the necessary development tools on this platform. I've been practicing my svn-foo, and I've been refamiliarizing myself with the all-important shell. <br/><br/>My editor of choice, so far, is medit. It's lightweight, provides some basic syntax highlighting, and doesn't get in my way. I may switch to a different editor eventually. SciTE, for one, is very reminiscent of the notepad++ editor I had been using on Windows, but has a few disappointing feature omissions that make it significantly less attractive then it's windows-based cousin. I tried Notepad++ through wine, but the performance was poorer then I could deal with. For the second time in my life I've tried to get acquainted with some of the iconic GNU/Linux programming editors: Vim and Emacs. Try as I might, I just can't wrap my mind around them.
<br><br>
As much as the command-line is the <i>de facto</i> programming environment on Linux, I'm always more comfortable with a good GUI. My SVN client at the moment is RapidSVN, although I've been looking at SVN Workbench as well. I've been bumbling around with the command-line svn, patch, and diff utilities as well, and will probably have to resort to them on occasion. It's always good to have a backup.
<br><br>
I've done a little perl work so far, but I haven't developed any C code on Linux yet. I'm interested to see how that will go. I'm not unfamiliar with GCC, but I am unfamilar with GDB and valgrind and all the other cool tools that i'm going to need to learn to use here. It's going to be a trial by fire, but if school has taught me anything, it's that I'm capable of learning cool new things like this. </p>
