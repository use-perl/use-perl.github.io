<p>I posted a journal entry earlier this morning. Lo and behold! When I come back tonight it isn't there. The save button I've been clicking actually says "Preview" and doesn't save. I've been looking for a way to change this behavior, but it appears to be unchangable.<br/><br/>As of last night, parrot compiles in the gsoc_pdd09 branch. Of course, as we all know, compiling isn't everything. And when it I say that "it compiles", I don't mean that the build process completes: Parrot and libparrot build, miniparrot doesn't (segfault) and the rest of the build process halts.<br/><br/>I'm a bit of a programming masochist, so I ran through the test suite with the generated executable. It wasn't as bad as I expected, about half the tests actually passed. Final count is 256/584 tests, 3423/7724 subtests fail. All test failures that I can see were segfault errors, as could probably be expected. <br/><br/>Knowing which tests fail and which don't is actually going to be very helpful to me in debugging where the problem is. I already know that small, memory non-intensive tests pass. Small trivial programs run, like the one below.<br/><br/> .sub main :main
   $S0 = "Hello World!"
   print $S0
 .end<br/><br/>Because of this, I know that the initialization code works fine: We don't segfault when the program starts up and we can do some basic allocations without problem. This was just the first small program I wrote, and you'll notice I only used a string constant. Things might be different in allocating a single PMC, and those are tests that I'm going to have to test later.<br/><br/>This week is a busy one for me, and I wont be able to do a lot of work or post a lot of journal entries for now. My schedule gets back to normal on the 30th, and I'll be back to hard-core debugging by then. </p>
