<p>I got some great help from chromatic today, he was able to trace the problem I was having in a much more aggressive way then I was doing it previously. I thought that the problem was in src/strings.c:Parrot_unmake_COW. I was getting a segfault on a pointer dereference, but I was getting thrown for a loop because the pointer in question wasn't NULL. Instead of a NULL pointer problem (which all my PARROT_ASSERTs were assuring me wasn't happening). <br/><br/>Chromatic tracked the error down to the pool compacting code in src/gc/resources.c. This is code that I personally haven't modified (or at least, not modified it much). However, other changes I've made elsewhere must have screwed it up some how. <br/><br/>Anyway, commenting out the compaction code fixed my segfault! However, in it's place, i get the cryptic error "list structure chaos #2!" from the code in src/lists.c. Digging through that code (which is old, largely uncommented, and dense) has yielded few results so far. I added some comments and fixed the error messages to be more helpful.<br/><br/>For the moment, I'm going to ignore the compacting code, and I'm going to try reinserting the sweeping code. Hopefully, I can make some good progress now.</p>
