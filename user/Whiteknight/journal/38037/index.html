<p>Let me be honest, I'm lousy with GDB. I don't think it's an inherent personal flaw so much as it is a lack of familiarity. It's certainly not one of those things that was ever covered (or even mentioned) in school. Not that I would expect to to have been covered, Temple's compsci program was mostly focused on Java, and the C programming I did for EE was mostly for embedded DOS-based systems where GDB wasn't available.<br/><br/>Anyway, a while back I bought a few books for cheap from Amazon. I don't remember which occasion I was celebrating exactly, my final paycheck from Google for the SoC, or my first paycheck from my new job. Either way, I was rolling in cash, at least compared to the poverty that I was living in previously, and wanted to do some celebrating. So I did what I always do when I have money: Buy books. One of the books that I ordered was "Debugging with GDB", by Stallman and Pesch.<br/><br/>Not long after placing the order, I moved with my then-fiance into our new apartment. I had gotten all the other books I ordered except the GDB book by then. I didn't come back home to check for another two weeks or so, and I realized the book had still not arrived, so I contacted Amazon.<br/><br/>They put me in touch with the seller. the seller and I talked.  He agreed to ship another copy (it was only a 3$ book, so it wasn't hurting his bottom-line any). Finally, after months of waiting, it showed up today.<br/><br/>Here's my pledge: I'm going to read every damn word in this book, and I'm going to use that information to improve my work on Parrot. Every little bit helps!</p>
