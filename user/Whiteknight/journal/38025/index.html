<p>I'm the release manager for the December release of Parrot. It doesn't require any particular qualifications, just sign up when they put out the call and appear half-competent to the people who make that decision. <br/><br/>The calling_conventions stuff hasn't panned out yet, and I've taken a bit of time off from it to clear my head. The second branch I created not only didn't help diagnose the problem I was having, but infact created a whole slew of new segfaults and problems that I couldn't trace down. In short, I deleted the second branch because it was useless.<br/><br/>I also haven't had a lot of time to work on it recently. The Thanksgiving holiday brought in a lot of family from out of time that needed to be a-socialized. On monday my brother finally came back from his semester abroad. My wife has been on a christmas rampage since December first, decorating and wrapping gifts and writing cards. I haven't been able to do any meaningful development in quite a while.<br/><br/>But, I will definitely be free for the 0.8.2 Parrot release on the 16th, and hopefully a few days between now and then to tie up loose ends on the calling_convention nonsense and prepare for the release. Here's hoping I don't really blow it.</p>
