<p>I finally got my jit_h_files branch finished and merged back into trunk yesterday. The branch primarily affected src/jit/i386/*, but there were a few other changes as well. Notably, I had to make a change to config/gen/makefiles/root.in to ensure the new .c files were actually built properly. I'm a makefile n00b, so I did't get that right the first time.<br/><br/>Merged in the branch and that created few errors for other people. Luckily, with some diagnostic help from moritz++ I was able to iron them out quickly. No harm, no foul.<br/><br/>In other news I've been chipping away idly at the book. I've added some inexplicably missing sections for classes, objects, and exceptions. I also added some stuff about jonathan++'s new annotation system. The book still doesn't contain any comprehensive discussion about how classes and objects are actually used in Parrot, so there is still a lot of work to be done about that.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to having some time this weekend to dig back into the GC and figure out where that damn string concatination error is coming from. I suspect that a string object is being prematurely recycled which was screwing with the pointers. Hopefully I'll be able to narrow it down and resolve it ASAP.</p>
