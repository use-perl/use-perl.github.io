<p>So, if I were - theoretically - going to Riga, to give a talk on 'Modern Perl', what would I talk about?<p>

Well, I of course already have some thoughts in mind. I would talk about how Modern Perl is readable, maintainable, and contains some of the collected knowledge of perl luminaries via the CPAN. I would talk about the Modern Perl books and Enlightened Perl Organization, and Perl Best Practices. I might describe how these organizations and individuals are working to communicate proven ways of working that can demonstrate perl's power and at the same time keep maintainability. 
<p>
Technically I might talk about using 'use strict' and 'use warnings'. I would talk about Moose. I would talk about using the CPAN and even perhaps becoming a CPAN habitue, scouring it for  good re-usable tidbits and ways to get my job done more quickly. 

I would talk about the surprising pace of change in perl 5, how it is bringing things from perl 6, how current ideas from other programming languages are leaking into CPAN. Not to mention perl tools modeled on tools from other programming languages. 
<p>
Perhaps I'd say Modern Perl is not a dogmatic ideology, but a loose affiliation of ideas and practices. Would I be wrong?</p>
