<p>Woo hoo! Got one monkey off my back, finally.
<P>
I wrote a 12 page paper about how our distributed hash harvester actually works. It's not on the web yet, because it needs to go through a review process, but I hope it will be soon.
<P>
It's not the most spectacular use of Perl. Having the same piece of code running on 6 PCs doing loosely parallel hashing, monitored by a master cron job and a couple database tables isn't rocket science - rockets are someone else's job.
<P>
Using <A HREF="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2001/05/01/expressions.html ">sexeger</A> was the best improvement we've made so far. It halved the time we were spending in our slowest section of code, and lowered our overall run time by 1/3.
<P>
I plan on going to YAPC::Europe::2002 and I submitted an abstract; hopefully I can give a presentation, but if not I'll certainly want to pick up as much input as possible. There's so much more I should be doing with benchmarking, hashing and ODBC modules.
<P>
More later, and hopefully a URL for the paper in the <A HREF="http://www.nsrl.nist.gov">NSRL website</A>.</p>

<h2>Interesting...</h2>

Sounds very interesting - I wrote something here at MessageLabs that sounds similar (though I'll know for sure when I read your paper) that does distributed hashing of emails so we can monitor how many of email X we've seen, and also have a global db of known spams - sort of like Razor, but not crap<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>I'd love to get a look at it.
